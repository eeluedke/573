[ABSTRACT] However , while we move closer to achieving the ambitious target of elimination of transmission ( EoT ) to humans , pockets of infection remain , and it becomes increasingly important to quantitatively assess if different regions are on track for elimination , and where intervention efforts should be focused . We present a previously developed stochastic mathematical model for gHAT in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and show that this same formulation is able to capture the dynamics of gHAT observed at the health area level ( approximately 10 , 000 people ) . This suggests that expanding health area fitting , to cover more of the DRC , should be done with deterministic fits for efficiency , but with stochastic projections used to capture both the parameter and stochastic variation in case reporting and elimination year estimations . The spatial heterogeneity in cases is reflected in modelling results , where we predict that under the current intervention strategies , the health area of Kinzamba II , which has approximately one third of the health zone 's cases , will have the latest expected year for EoT . The analysis focuses on utilising a particle filter Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methodology to fit the model to the data from 16 health areas of Mosango health zone in Kwilu province as a case study . The intensification of intervention activities against the fatal vector-borne disease gambiense human African trypanosomiasis ( gHAT , sleeping sickness ) in the last two decades has led to a large decline in the number of annually reported cases . This analysis was the first time any stochastic gHAT model has been fitted directly to case data and allows us to better quantify the uncertainty in our results . We find that fitting the analogous deterministic version of the gHAT model using MCMC has substantially faster computation times than fitting the stochastic model using pMCMC , but produces virtually indistinguishable posterior parameterisation .
[INTRODUCTION] Additional interventions such as vector control have also been deployed in selected high-prevalence locations to reduce tsetse populations and hence reduce transmission , although operational considerations have prevented the use of vector control in many endemic foci , especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) which is a large country with most ( > 57 % ) of the gHAT case burden for 2021 . A second advantage of stochastic modelling is that it is straightforward to establish at what time in the simulation that elimination of transmission and elimination of infection is achieved , whereas the analogous deterministic model would require us to specific a proxy threshold for elimination -this is most pertinent to our projections forward in time following model calibration . This is small enough to capture local variation in transmission and to define operationally-appropriate intervention areas , yet not so small as to be too computationally intensive to implement across the endemic region , or mean there is insufficient data for each location to fit a model . This means that early diagnosis can substantially reduce the likelihood of onward transmission , by reducing the time people spend infectious and hence the possibility that tsetse will take blood meals on infected people , as well as preventing the worst disease and death in patients . However , when the target is EoT , it becomes key to estimate the real number of infections , which can not directly
[RESULTS] We also re-iterate that this is to have a 50 % probability of EoT and to have higher confidence that EoT has truly occurred , it would be recommended for vertical interventions to remain in place for several more years , as would also be recommended based on current WHO guidelines for active screening . On performing the fitting process on data for each of the 16 health areas independently , the fitting ended successfully in each case , with an ESS of at least
[DISCUSSION] In demonstrating that a mechanistic , stochastic infection model can be fitted to different health area data in the DRC , we have added a new framework that can provide highly detailed calibration and projections of future gHAT infections for a range of intervention scenarios . The greater nuance afforded by smaller-scale health area modelling will further refine the ability to accurately forecast future infections for intervention scenarios , allowing policymakers to better understand the cost and impact of proposed interventions . The similarity in fitting stochastic models to data and simulating stochastic models , but using deterministic variants for fitting , validates the approach of previous studies and indicates that stochastic fitting may not always be necessary . The importance of stochastic models however remains clear , in determining the time to elimination of transmission and our uncertainty in this .
[METHODS] We chose this health zone as a case study since it is located in the relatively high-burden province of Kwilu , has had annual active screening for gHAT infection and the number of cases detected is geographically diverse , but some cases have been detected in each of the health areas within the health zone .

[ABSTRACT] We present an approach to achieve these goals based on summarizing spatial relationships in the TME using spatial K functions , and then applying functional data analysis and random forest models to both predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships . Exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups , as well as determining the extent to which this information can predict outcomes such as patient survival or treatment success with emerging immunotherapies , is of great interest . We further used the proposed approach to interrogate two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients . This approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments at both identifying important spatial interactions while also controlling the false discovery rate . Tumor microenvironments ( TMEs ) contain vast amounts of information on patient 's cancer through their cellular composition and the spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations . Moreover , in the face of a large number of cell interactions to consider , we often wish to identify specific interactions that are useful in making such predictions . The methods proposed are publicly available in a companion R package funkycells .
[INTRODUCTION] In the section Materials and methods , we give a detailed description of the data we consider and the methods to analyze them , including sub-sections on how we fit a modified random forest in this setting , and how we evaluate the statistical significance and uncertainty in measuring the variable importance of spatial interactions of cell types as encoded by K functions . Existing methods developed to study cellular interactions in the TME have exploited cell neighborhood analysis in which the spatial relationship between a cell of interest and its neighboring cells can reveal particular cell-cell interactions associated with a disease state or changes associated with response to therapy ; see e. g. . Many statistical methods proposed to date rely on simple summaries of the images , such as the average number of cells observed , or otherwise simplify the data by , for example , initially clustering cells into groups ( e. g. [ 10 , 18 , 38-41 ] ) . After performing dimension reduction using functional principal components analysis , these data are combined with non-functional patient meta-data , such as age or sex , and a modified random forest model is used to predict the patient outcome . Our method also indicated that there did not appear to be measurable differences in the spatial arrangement of tumor and immune cell types , as measured by homogeneous K functions , between the LUSC and LUAD groups . In comparing TME data , different spatial relationships between cell types , e. g. between tumor cells and specific immune
[RESULTS] We saw that each threshold appeared to be effective in detecting clustering or dispersion relationships , such that even relatively small changes were detected with high frequency , even when considering many variables , see also Appendix E. Table 1 further shows the empirical false discovery rate computed from 100 independent simulations for 4 and 16 cell types with a simulated population of 34 patients evenly split between positive and negative response groups . The primary goals of the simulation experiment were to demonstrate that the proposed method is effective at
[DISCUSSION] We note , however , that since our approach compares K functions between different groups , rather than against the theoretical K functions associated with complete spatial randomness ( as is typical in other circumstances ) , the lack of underlying spatial homogeneity in the TME for a data set may not be overly problematic . We consider the case in which we compare TME and meta data or clinical data from two different patient groups , and develop a model to identify significant differences between these groups in the distribution of cell phenotypes , protein antigens , or a mixture thereof . Random forest models designed for continuous or survival time analysis exist , e. g. , and metrics such as L2 error can be used in place of the difference function of the OOB and naïve estimates . Consequently , the approach may be useful in methods applied to cell phenotypes based on proteins ( OPAL , MIBI , Phenocycler Fusion ) or transcripts ( Xenium , Cosmx , MERscope ) expression [ 43-49 ] . Furthermore , whilst we have focused throughout this paper on K functions , we note that the methods presented here can be applied to any summary functions from spatial statistics , or indeed any functions in general . For the TNBC data , we compare two groups of tumors that are separated into `` compartmentalised '' and ``
[METHODS] ( 8 ) Since our ultimate goal includes evaluating which spatial interactions or elements of the meta-data are useful in predicting the outcomes , we use a random forest model for f.

[ABSTRACT] In particular , the strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction , followed by selective removal of weak contacts , allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections . To investigate the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms , we combine a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms : ( i ) only spike-timing-dependent plasticity ( STDP ) , ( ii ) only homeostatic structural plasticity ( hSP ) , i. e. , without weight-dependent pruning and without STDP , ( iii ) a combination of STDP and hSP , i. e. , without weight-dependent pruning , and ( iv ) a combination of STDP and structural plasticity ( SP ) that includes hSP and weight-dependent pruning . When weaker contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning , synchrony is achieved with significantly sparser connections than in randomly structured networks in the STDP-only model . We computationally study how neuronal dynamics , synaptic weights , and network structure co-emerge , in particular , during ( de ) synchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbation . These findings may inform future pre-clinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive stimulus modalities aiming at inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms , e. g. , in Parkinson 's disease . To accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing , STDP , and SP , we introduce a simple stochastic SP model , enabling detailed numerical analyses . We compare the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model ( i ) with the desynchronization of models ( iii ) and ( iv ) . With tools from network theory , we reveal that structural reorganization may remarkably enhance the network 's level of synchrony . The latter require stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization . Abnormally strong neural synchronization may impair brain function , as observed in several brain disorders . This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency , degree-degree correlations , and a mixture of degree assortativity .
[INTRODUCTION] To this end , we use our model of plastic neuronal networks to assess the effectiveness of a stimulation protocol named Uncorrelated Multichannel Random Stimulation ( UMRS ) , a technique similar to previously developed stimulation methods belonging to the CR family , in driving the network out of a pathological model state thereby inducing long-term desynchronization . To account for additional plasticity mechanisms , in this study , we also focus on the effect of SP on the response of neuronal networks to stimulation by comparing the desynchronization of random networks with frozen structures with those that undergo synaptic reorganization to reach a steady synchronized state . Networks of LIF neurons with STDP can display bistablily by residing in either a synchronized or a desynchronized state [ 21-24 ] , which mimic the pathological and physiological states , respectively , in the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) and Basal Ganglia of patients with PD [ 29-31 ] . Plastic networks of leaky integrate-and-fire ( LIF ) model neurons have been used to design and validate effective stimulation methods such as coordinated and random reset ( CR and RR ) stimulation [ 21-24 ] , which leverage the synaptic weight plasticity to induce therapeutic effects . Non-trivial qualitative stimulus-response predictions , e. g. , the emergence of cumulative and long-term effects , were key to the development of the corresponding pre-clinical and
[RESULTS] The range of average NDD that is large enough to enable synchronization but not enough to promote clustering of neurons is smaller for networks of non-identical neurons compared to those of identical neurons since the identical neurons can get synchronized at significantly lower values of average NDD with a low average firing rate , while clustering occurs at large average NDDs , making the plateaus in Fig 6B , 6C , 6D and 6E larger for identical neurons . Similar
[DISCUSSION] As the network progressed through SP iterations , the neurons became increasingly more identical by adding or losing contacts as their firing rates converged to a single target rate with both SP methods ( stochastic and BvOSP ) regardless of weight-dependent pruning , making way for enhanced network synchronization for any value of the probability of weight-dependent pruning , i. e. , Pw ∈ . With BvOSP ( Pw > 0 ) , the dependence of out-degree on the natural firing rate of the neurons in a steady state was different than that with the stochastic SP model since BvOSP identically controlled both in- and out-degrees via firing rate-dependent sprouting of both dendritic and axonal elements , such that the neurons with a natural firing rate close to the target formed fewer dendritic and axonal elements , while our stochastic SP did not directly constrain the out-degree . With the stochastic SP method , the above factors resulted in a strong relationship between the natural firing rate of the neurons and their in- and out- degrees , such that the neurons with higher ( lower ) natural firing rates had more ( fewer ) outgoing and fewer ( more ) incoming contacts , suggesting that effectively the faster neurons

[ABSTRACT] Our results suggest a model in which patterned delta-2-expressing neurons instruct phagocytic progenitors to locally differentiate into glia , presenting a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types . Loss of several delta-2-expressing neuron classes prevented differentiation of the glia associated with them , whereas transplantation of delta-2-expressing photoreceptor neurons was sufficient for glia formation at an ectopic location . Some animals can regenerate large missing regions of their nervous system , requiring mechanisms to restore the pattern , numbers , and wiring of diverse neuron classes . We found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing a Delta-encoding gene , delta-2 , at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems . Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians , but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types . Because injuries are unpredictable , regeneration must be accomplished from an unlimited number of starting points . Coordinated regeneration of neuron-glia architecture is thus a major challenge and remains poorly understood . Planarian glia are specified later from dispersed Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors . In planarians , neurons and glia are regenerated from distinct progenitors .
[INTRODUCTION] By contrast , phagocytic specialized neoblasts do not display overt fate specification programs associated with one of their final fate outcomes , raising the possibility that their final fate choice is regulated at a later stage-in the migratory post-mitotic progenitors these neoblasts produce . Given the coordinated regeneration of planarian neurons and glia , and the lack of known glial fate specification programs in the stem cell state , we considered the possibility that some signaling mechanism between the nervous system and phagocytic progenitors could specify glia . Even though most glia in other organisms have been described to be of neuroepithelial origin ( ectoderm ) , in most organisms a subset of mesodermal ( e. g. , microglia in vertebrates and GLR glia in C. elegans ) or mesectoderm ( midline glia in Drosophila ) derived glial cells have also been described [ 13-15 ] . Based on our findings , we describe a model in which patterned expression of a Delta protein in particular neurons interacts with Notch-expressing , dispersed phagocytic progenitors to accomplish coordinated regeneration of planarian neurons and glia . Planarian glia are found within the neuropil of both the cephalic ganglia and the ventral cords , around commissural neurons connecting the ventral cords , in the head rim where sensory neurons are found , associated with eyes , and dorsally scattered around the animal midline ( Fig 1A , ) . Some neoblast classes , such as for muscle , are comprised of distinct subsets , each displaying a specification program associated with a particular differentiated muscle type (
[RESULTS] Inhibition of abundant neural transcription factors ( TFs ) , like coe and sim decreased glia numbers in the neuropil , and the inhibition of the TFs ovo and soxB1-2 , which are required for the specification of eye cells and pkdl-1+ dorsal midline neurons , respectively , was previously shown to decrease numbers of glial cells in those locations without affecting regeneration of other glial subsets ( S3D Fig and ) . To study the nature of the requirement of Notch signaling in the planarian nervous system and phagocytic cell
[DISCUSSION] Whereas neuron-glia choices have been found to be regulated by Notch from a common progenitor in animal development , this work shows that this same pathway can regulate glia specification and differentiation through interaction between mature neurons and an unrelated class of phagocytic progenitors . The modular nature of this coordinated regeneration mechanism could also readily facilitate evolution of new configurations of glia in the nervous system , by any particular neuron population acquiring or losing expression of delta-2 and having access to dispersed phagocytic progenitors . By having the final fate choice for glia be determined in migratory post-mitotic phagocytic progenitors , local signals from neurons interacting with these progenitors can solve these challenges , resulting in precise local coordination of pattern . This mechanism uncovers a novel approach for integrating glia with neurons in a regenerating nervous system , solving the challenge of specifying glia in proper numbers and locations utilizing a Delta-Notch glia-specification signaling process . Ongoing Delta expression in neurons is also required to constitutively maintain the glia state in neighboring glial cells , further supporting the long-term coordination of these cell types ( Fig 4C ) . In the case of neurons and glia , the exact number and position of certain neuron classes can be variable animal-to-animal , or even between the left-to-right sides of the animals ( e. g. , see Fig 3G and 3I ) . How the precise numbers

[ABSTRACT] Expression of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells were found to be significantly higher in broad neutralizers during AHI , and associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later . We characterized early gamma-delta ( γδ ) T cell responses starting from pre-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in participants previously characterized for neutralization breadth development . In addition , the levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells was associated with early production of founder virus Env-specific IgM . We found significant differences in γδ T cell surface marker expression in participants that developed neutralization breadth compared to those that did not . Thus , γδ T cells may promote development of neutralization breadth , which has implications for HIV vaccine strategies . Activation of γδ T cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and associated with viral load . New HIV vaccine approaches are focused on eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies .
[INTRODUCTION] Using the RV217 acute HIV infection ( AHI ) cohort , we have previously shown that B cell activation and engagement with founder Env within the first month of viremia are predictive of the development of neutralization breadth years later . Here , we investigated γδ T cells prior to HIV-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in RV217 individuals previously identified as 'broad ' and 'non-broad ' neutralizers , and determined their relationship with viral replication as well as bNAb elicitation . In humans , the most common subset in peripheral blood is defined by expression of the Vδ2 chain and recognize non-peptide phosphoantigens produced by some bacteria and protozoa such as Plasmodium falciparum . Furthermore , they share features with other innate like T cells , such as activation by cytokines in the absence of TCR signal or by activating receptors usually associated with NK cell functions . Expression levels of CD16 on Vδ1+ T cells as well as CD57 on Vδ2+ T cells during AHI were higher in participants that developed breadth and were significantly associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later . Understanding the innate and adaptive immune pathways that promote B cell activation in response to HIV-1 infection could inform HIV-1 vaccine design for the elicitation of neutralization breadth . Vδ1 T cells are abundant in mucosal tissues but are also found in peripheral blood , albeit at a lower frequency , and the antigens recognized by their TCR are less well defined . Additionally , γδ T cells have been reported to have anti-HIV activity by producing β-chemokines that can block
[RESULTS] First , to determine the dynamics of γδ T cell responses during AHI and CHI , Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ T cells from 22 selected RV217 participants , who were previously identified as 'broad ' ( N = 11 ) and 'non-broad ' neutralizers ( N = 11 ) ( Table 1 ) were sorted ( Fig 1A and S1 ) from PBMC samples collected at median −185 ( pre-acquisition ) , 18 ( corresponding to peak VL ) , 42 ( corresponding to set point VL ) , and 980 days ( CHI )
[DISCUSSION] In this study , we evaluated the frequency and phenotype of γδ T cells longitudinally starting from pre-HIV acquisition and during untreated AHI in participants with or without neutralization breadth , allowing us to evaluate the contribution of γδ T cells to initial control of viral replication and to the promotion of humoral immune responses . In our cohort , the levels of antibodies against PfCSP c-term , indicative of exposure to malaria sporozoite , showed a positive association with CD16 expression on Vδ1+ T cells , suggesting that malaria exposure might contribute to the phenotype of γδ T cells associated with the development of neutralization breadth , but other unidentified factors might also be important . However , the prospective cohort allowed us to show that expression of these two markers was not modulated by HIV-1 and that significant differences were already present pre-HIV acquisition for CD16 and CD57 levels on Vδ2+ T cells . Understanding the mechanism by which γδ T cells promote the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies could help develop strategies targeting these cells to improve vaccine induced humoral immune responses , especially the induction of broad and potent neutralizing antibody to HIV-1 Env . These differences were specific to γδ T cells as we did not observe differences in CD16 nor CD57 levels at any time points on conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells or NK cells between participants who developed neutralization breadth and those who did not .

[ABSTRACT] It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner , and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors ( IL-6R and IL-8R ) with a novel bispecific antibody , BS1 , significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer . Bispecific antibodies ( BsAbs ) , which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule , are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects . Here , we describe a quantitative , computational model of the BS1 BsAb , exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design . The spread of cancer from organ to organ ( metastasis ) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths ; however , most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread . However , while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential , elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments . We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complexes . Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition , providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design .
[INTRODUCTION] Simultaneous inhibition of the IL-6/IL-8 signaling network with tocilizumab , a monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor-alpha ( IL-6Rα , hereafter denoted IL-6R ) antibody primarily used to treat rheumatoid arthritis , and reparixin , a small molecule allosteric inhibitor of the IL-8 receptor ( IL-8R ) that recently completed phase II clinical trials against breast cancer , was found to decrease in vitro cell migration and significantly decrease in vivo metastasis without affecting rates of tumor growth . Binding mechanics ( receptor complex formation ) of each antibody are expressed in a series of coupled differential equations , and we use quantitative experimental data of the interactions of antibodies with IL-6R and IL-8R to estimate the kinetic constants for the system and create a complete model of antibody interactions that is faithful to the biophysics . Mechanistic computational models of antibody-target interactions can address this knowledge gap-by incorporating parameters for both monovalent binding affinity and multivalent binding avidity with differential equations describing the binding kinetics , we can investigate the influence of these factors on the binding of monospecific and bispecific antibodies [ 34-36 ] . Overall , our model simulations with different antibody constructs clarify the effects of binding domain affinity and target expression on receptor inhibition , providing insight that is applicable not only to our particular BsAb system , but also more broadly to bispecific antibody therapeutic design . Above a threshold cell density , cancer cells secrete IL-6 and IL-8 , which synergistically activate a complex paracrine signaling pathway
[RESULTS] The optimizations performed with normalization against BS1 show stronger convergence around a single optimal value for each parameter and less dependence on the initial value used ( Fig 2A , lower panel ) , compared to simulations normalized to results for each antibody individually , which show a wider spread in the optimal values obtained and a greater reliance on the value of the initial guess ( S2 and S4 Figs ) . However , this result can be rationalized by the fact that the increase in
[DISCUSSION] While receptor synthesis , internalization , and degradation were assumed to be negligible in modeling antibodies binding to cultured cells , given the importance of antibody-receptor complex internalization in determining the drug concentration profile and localization within tissues [ 67-69 ] , it would be informative to extend the bivalent binding model presented here to include these processes . IL-8R has not been directly quantified in solid tumors , but it is found on monocytes and neutrophils at levels of 104 to 105 receptors per cell , and it was shown to be up-regulated relative to IL-6R in primary breast cancer tumor samples . Increased ternary complex formation as the free antibody concentration declines demonstrates the impact of avidity in bivalent antibody binding-in the single-receptor-positive cell lines where only one domain is capable of binding , there is no increase in bound receptor after the washout phase ( Fig 4 ) . When one receptor is in excess of the other , as IL-8R was in our IL-6R+/IL-8R+ experimental cell line , we found that binary complexes with the excess receptor will continue to accumulate after the ternary complex concentration reaches steady state due to the consumption of the limited receptor . Our simulations show that when antibody ( either monospecific or bispecific ) is present in excess of the receptor concentration , the less-stable binary

[ABSTRACT] Here , we have gained insight into this question through studies of ZYG-8 , a conserved doublecortin-family kinase ; the mammalian homolog of this microtubule-associated protein is upregulated in many cancers and has been implicated in cell division , but the mechanisms by which it functions are poorly understood . During acentrosomal spindle assembly in C. elegans oocytes , microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards away from the chromosomes where they form poles , but then these outward forces must be balanced to form a stable bipolar structure . Importantly , experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion led to excess outward forces within the spindle and suggested a potential role for this protein in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5 . Further , we found that ZYG-8 is also required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte spindle and that kinase activity is required for its function during both meiosis and mitosis . Altogether , our findings reveal new roles for ZYG-8 in oocytes and provide insights into how acentrosomal spindles are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis . We found that ZYG-8 depletion from oocytes resulted in overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects . How forces and dynamics are tuned to create a stable bipolar structure is poorly understood . Although centrosomes help organize spindles in most cell types , oocytes of most species lack these structures . Simultaneously , microtubule dynamics must be precisely controlled to maintain spindle length and organization .
[INTRODUCTION] In recent years , C. elegans has emerged as a powerful model to dissect mechanisms that promote acentrosomal spindle assembly and maintenance , since rapid depletion methods have been developed that enable the removal of proteins from oocytes within minutes . In human oocytes , these acentrosomal spindles have been shown to be highly unstable ; after bipolarity is achieved , the poles often split apart , and this instability leads to a high incidence of chromosome segregation errors . These methods have made it possible to either deplete proteins prior to spindle formation , to probe for roles in spindle assembly , or to remove proteins from pre-formed spindles and then assess effects on the stability of the structure [ 7-9 ] . Further , we demonstrate that ZYG-8 's kinase activity is required for its functions in both mitosis and meiosis , and we reveal important roles for this protein in modulating both microtubule dynamics and motor-driven forces within the oocyte spindle . Removal of the microtubule polymerase ZYG-9 from pre-formed spindles causes microtubules in the center of the spindle to splay and poles to split , suggesting that regulation of microtubule dynamics is essential for the spindle to maintain its structure . KLP-18/kinesin-12 , a plus-end directed microtubule motor , sorts microtubule minus ends outwards to establish bipolarity ; depletion of KLP-18 results in a monopolar spindle in which microtubule minus ends coalesce into a single pole at the center with plus ends radiating outwards . Although it is known that force
[RESULTS] This phenotype was also confirmed using live imaging , where auxin-treated ZYG-8 AID monopolar spindles did not reorganize into bipolar spindles in the bmk-1 ( ok391 ) mutant and we never observed chromosomes segregating bidirectionally in anaphase ; instead chromosomes moved towards the center of the monopole as the spindle decreased in size , indistinguishable from normal monopolar anaphase ( Fig 6C , S8 and S9 Videos ; 5/5 auxin-treated spindles remained monopolar ) . First , staining with the microtubule minus end marker ASPM-1 revealed pole defects
[DISCUSSION] Notably , both of these proposed functions are consistent with ZYG-8 's localization pattern ; ZYG-8 localizes broadly across the spindle , which would enable it to modulate microtubule dynamics at both the poles and midspindle , and it also co-localizes with BMK-1 throughout meiosis , making it plausible that it could also regulate the activity of this motor . One possibility is that the pole defects could be caused by a combination of the proposed effects on microtubule dynamics and spindle forces ; if microtubules become more stable and motors produce excess outward forces , this may cause stress on the spindle structure that could cause the midspindle to bend and the poles to split . Thus , we propose that ZYG-8 plays at least two important roles in C. elegans oocytes : 1 ) ZYG-8 regulates microtubule dynamics , to facilitate the proper turnover of microtubules within the spindle , and 2 ) ZYG-8 influences the activity of motors that walk along those microtubules , to tune the forces that build and stabilize the spindle . Specifically , experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion results in excess outward forces during spindle assembly and ZYG-8 removal from pre-formed monopoles resulted in minus ends being pushed outwards to form multiple poles ( Fig 9C ) . We found that the zyg-8D604N kinase dead mutant had elongated bipolar
[METHODS] Since we have found that oocytes begin to arrest and eventually die after extended light exposure , we filmed for a maximum of 15 minutes and discarded any movies that exhibited signs of arrest ( e. g. , movies in which the chromosomes stopped moving before the end of the timecourse ) ; to determine the effects of protein depletion beyond this 15",,966,97,None,"During acentrosomal spindle assembly in C . elegans oocytes , microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards away from the chromosomes where they form poles; then these outward forces must be balanced to form a stable bipolar structure .

[ABSTRACT] Secondly , using an interaction quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis , we describe four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank , for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions show attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls . By integrating these data with large-scale T2D GWAS from the DIAMANTE meta-analysis through Mendelian randomization analyses , we find 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D , all spanning lipid-related classes except for Glucose and Tyrosine . In this study , we investigate the interplay between genetics , metabolomics , and T2D risk in the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel composed of 249 metabolites , 92 % of which correspond to lipids ( HDL , IDL , LDL , VLDL ) and lipoproteins . The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis are significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but are not associated with T2D risk , pointing towards consequences of T2D on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels . Finally , through differential level analyses , we find 165 metabolites associated with microvascular , macrovascular , or both types of T2D complications , with only a few discriminating between complication classes . Overall , this work provides a map of the consequences of T2D on Nightingale targeted metabolite levels and on their genetic regulation , enabling a better understanding of the T2D trajectory leading to complications . Circulating metabolite levels have been associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , but the extent to which T2D affects metabolite levels and their genetic regulation remains to be elucidated . Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2D liability , spanning almost all tested classes , including branched-chain amino acids . Of the 165 metabolites , 40 are not causally linked to T2D in either direction , suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications .
[INTRODUCTION] One particular example is BCAAs , for which some studies have described a causal effect of valine , leucine and/or isoleucine on T2D [ 13-15 ] , while more recent evidence has shown no causal effect of BCAAs on T2D risk in the UK Biobank ( UKBB ) cohort . Improved prediction of various complex traits using metabolite profiles over genetic scores has been shown , but this improvement is rather limited when compared to classical risk factors including age , sex and family history of disease . For this , we considered profiles of 249 metabolites from the UKBB cohort assessed through the Nightingale panel , mostly composed of lipids and lipoproteins classes ( around 92 % of metabolites ) , and covering additional classes such as amino acids ( 10 metabolites ) , ketone bodies ( 4 metabolites ) , glycolysis-related metabolites ( 4 metabolites ) , and markers of inflammation ( 1 metabolite ) . Exploring the links between metabolite levels and T2D can help us gain insights into how these relationships may influence trajectories towards T2D complications , for which underlying biological mechanisms are still to be unraveled . Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is a common , complex disease , with a prevalence that is expected to increase dramatically , and for which the genetics has been largely described through genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) meta-analysis efforts [ 1-3 ] . Increasing
[RESULTS] Overall , we found the profile of associations with metabolites to be similar with the MR estimates observed with T2D liability , with 78 % of the metabolites associated with at least one complication and significant in the reverse MR having concordant direction of association between the two analyses , including decreases in most cholesterol metabolites , apolipoprotein B and glycine . Of these , glycine and glycoprotein A were significant only in the reverse direction and associated with microvascular complications , suggesting
[DISCUSSION] We identified 165 associations between metabolite levels and the risk of developing T2D complications , most of which were shared across complication groups with only few , such as creatinine and glycine , being more strongly associated with microvascular than macrovascular outcomes despite smaller sample size of the microvascular group . On the other hand , our findings could be of clinical relevance , as for example the interaction variants identified for the percentages of L_LDL_PL , L_VLDL_TG and L_VLDL_FC in our study are regulators of CETP , a target of lipid-lowering drugs , which have been shown to correlate with diabetes incidence . In this study , we were restricted to the European ancestry DIAMANTE study from 2018 because it was the latest one with summary statistics available without the UKBB samples , which enables us to avoid sample overlap between the exposure and outcome and to limit potential related bias . By performing an agnostic genome-wide scan to look for interaction signals , we have observed that all the interaction variants , which are mQTLs at a population-level , led to a decreased magnitude of metabolite genetic regulation in the T2D patients ' group compared to the control group . In addition to investigating relationships between metabolite levels and T2D , we described
[METHODS] A total of 249 metabolite levels obtained from the Nightingale platform using nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy is available in the UKBB cohort as part of two different releases covering a total of 274 , 352 individuals : 117 , 967 in the first release , and 156 , 385 in the second release .

[ABSTRACT] We hypothesize that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice , reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival . In previous work , we established that collaborative cross ( CC ) mouse line CC061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection ( MRSA , USA300 ) , while CC024 is tolerant . Survival after MRSA infection in the F1 and F2 generations was 65 % and 55 % and followed a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the CC024 increased survival phenotype . C5ar1 and C5ar2 are receptors for the complement factor C5a , an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response by binding to these receptors . To identify host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection , we crossed CC061 mice and CC024 mice to generate F1 and F2 populations . Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) colonizes humans asymptomatically but can also cause opportunistic infections , ranging from mild skin infections to severe life-threatening conditions . In this QTL , the WSB/EiJ ( WSB ) allele was present in CC024 mice and contributed to their MRSA tolerant phenotype . Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in their parents , suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors . We identified a Quantitative Trait Locus ( QTL ) peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection . Two genes , C5ar1 and C5ar2 , have high-impact variants in this region . Resistance is limiting the pathogen burden , while tolerance is limiting the health impact of a given pathogen burden . Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection .
[INTRODUCTION] The Collaborative Cross ( CC ) is a large panel of genetically diverse recombinant mouse strains derived from eight founder strains ( five classical inbred strains-A/J , C57BL/6J ( BL6 ) , 129S1/SvlmJ , NOD/ShiLtJ , NZO/HlLtJ , and three wild-derived strains-CAST/EiJ , PWK/PhJ , and WSB/EiJ ) . We created a large F2 intercross panel by crossing collaborative cross ( CC ) strains with known phenotypes with respect to MRSA USA300 infection , using a MRSA susceptible strain ( CC061 ) and a tolerant strain ( CC024 ) . In our previous work we determined that parental CC061 mice rapidly lost weight and met our euthanasia criteria , while CC024 mice lost less weight and survived the study period . Crosses between CC strains have been successful in identifying genetic loci underlying susceptibility to seizure , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis , and Salmonella Typhimurium infections . In this work we demonstrate that survival in F1 and F2 generation followed a complex dominant pattern of inheritance for the CC024 phenotype . This variability in disease outcomes after S. aureus colonization , suggests that this host-pathogen interaction may depend on both bacterial and host genetics . S. aureus is a growing cause of concern because it spreads easily , and many isolates are resistant to several classes of antibiotics . Globally , S. aureus is one of the leading causes of bacterial-related hospitalizations and is responsible for more than one million deaths annually . These superficial infections are
[RESULTS] Thus , based on previous associations with the immune function , enrichment of complement cascade in CC024 mice and F2 kidney mRNA expression data , C5ar1 and C5ar2 are our top candidate genes for involvement in the tolerance phenotype in the 24SMI ( survival ) QTL peak . Some notable genes that enriched these two pathways include complement components-C1qa , C1qb , C1qc , and Cfh , coagulation components-Fgb , F2 , F12 , and Plg , and serine/cysteine peptidase inhibitors Serpina ( 1a-e and
[DISCUSSION] This hypothesis is also consistent with our finding that heterozygotes at these loci survive poorly ( Fig 5B and 5C ) ; a single CC061 allele for one of these receptors may be sufficient to allow activation of the complement system , leading to reduced survival in heterozygotes . Although C5Ra1 and C5Ra2 are targets or receptors for staphylococcal virulence factors Chemotaxis Inhibiting Protein of S. aureus ( CHIPS ) , Panton Valentin Leukocidin ( PVL ) and gamma hemolysin CB ( hlgCB ) in humans , murine neutrophils are resistant to PVL and hlgCB and do not bind CHIPS [ 86-91 ] . Though IL-27 , along with IL-10 , has been shown to enhance nasal colonization and increase susceptibility to S. aureus pneumonia , its role in suppressing inflammation in the later stages of infection may be beneficial in CC024 mice . While we do not understand the mechanism underlying the baseline up-regulation of complement genes , C3 and C4b in CC024 , increased expression of these immune factors may improve CC024 survival by reducing the initial pathogen load . Here , natural variants occurring within the complement system could benefit the host by reducing inflammation and tissue damage in certain situations , thereby increasing the ability of the host to tolerate an infection for longer periods of time
[METHODS] The CC strains were initially purchased from UNC 's Systems Genetics Core Facility ( SGCF ) and were bred at the Division of Comparative Medicine at Texas A & M University to generate F1 and F2 generation ( S1 Table ) . Data from this earlier study for CC024 and CC061 includes survival after infection , organ colonization , tissue damage",,987,98,None,"The pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of concern because it spreads easily and can cause opportunistic infections , ranging from mild skin infections to severe life-threatening conditions .

[ABSTRACT] The network model also had a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations , with a considerable density at deleterious selection coefficients . Current models of evolution consider additive genotype-phenotype relationships while often ignoring the contribution of gene interactions to phenotypic variance . Our results suggest that the interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects . Using forward-time genetic simulations , we measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models . In this study , we model a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network , the negative autoregulation motif . A key expectation from adaptive walk theory is that the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations is exponential . We found that both models instead harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected . This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity , where correlations among traits constrain adaptation . The tempo and mode of adaptation depends on the availability of beneficial alleles . However , the extent to which networks affect adaptation remains largely unknown . Genetic interactions arising from gene networks can restrict this availability .
[INTRODUCTION] We use Wright-Fisher simulations to describe the adaptive walks of populations following an optimum shift with either an additive or NAR GP map , and examine which extreme value distribution domain ( Gumbel , Weibull , or Fréchet ) best captures the behavior of our model . In plants , expression of the oil biosynthesis transcription factor WRINKLED1 ( WRI1 ) is driven via a NAR network that has been evolutionarily conserved from at least the split between monocotyledons and dicotyledons ( about 140 million years ) . These models derive from Fisher 's infinitesimal model , which supposes that continuous trait distributions can be produced by loci under Mendelian segregation as long as those loci are a ) many , and b ) have small , additive effects on the phenotype . Modeling the molecular networks underpinning trait development and expression can help us understand how gene interactions and regulatory processes shape the survival and reproductive success of organisms , and provide a mechanistic view of how variation arises in natural populations . As we delve deeper into the nature of the genotype-phenotype-fitness landscape , it becomes important to re-evaluate our foundational quantitative genetic models in light of our current understanding of the molecular basis of traits . This model is the basis of modern quantitative genetics , providing a simple GP map that requires no information about the underlying genetic systems that describe the developmental and physiological underpinnings of traits . The ubiquity of the NAR motif in nature comes as a result of its self-balancing property : when a gene
[RESULTS] To explore how the nonlinearity of the GP map might have influenced how populations navigated molecular component space , we examined the ratio of absolute additive effect sizes on molecular components among populations that adapted by two steps or more , denoted by ϕ ( Fig 6D ) . We fit this in two ways : first , by pooling all replicates and sampling from this pooled distribution to estimate the GPD parameters ; and second , by sampling each replicate at each of its adaptive steps separately and estimating the
[DISCUSSION] The utility of our model also extends beyond evolutionary biology , offering valuable insights for interdisciplinary collaborations that aim to integrate molecular biology , computational science , and statistical genetics . We have introduced how networks can generate epistasis , with implications for the evolution of recombination , maintenance of linkage , and the trade-offs between network complexity and adaptability . It offers a robust framework to investigate issues such as the maintenance of genetic variation , the evolution of recombination , and the dynamics of adaptation from both standing variation and de novo mutations . Our network approach contributes methodologically to the field and holds broad applicability to many open questions in evolutionary biology , from quantitative genetics to the mechanisms underpinning adaptability . While promising , it is essential to acknowledge the model 's limitations , particularly concerning its computational demands and simplifications , which future work should aim to address . As detailed systems models of complex traits become increasingly available , our framework can be employed to simulate the evolution of traits based on empirically-described networks . Future work should focus on leveraging this interdisciplinary potential and on exploring more complex genetic networks to better understand how gene interactions constrain evolution . Our study here shows that networks can create complex distributions of fitness effects that differ from additive expectations . Expanding into adaptation by standing variation will further illuminate the role of

[ABSTRACT] We propose a novel , Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses which suggests that they are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration . While animals behave as if they optimally integrate information according to Bayesian probability theory , the implementation of the required computations in the biological substrate remains unclear . Our theory explains various experimental findings on the system and single-cell level related to multi-sensory integration , which we illustrate with simulations . We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule , allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities . A fundamental function of cortical circuits is the integration of information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior . We formally demonstrate that under these assumptions the somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior . In our approach apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials , while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials . These are parametrized by local quantities , the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances . Furthermore , we make experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity .
[INTRODUCTION] According to Bayesian probability theory , the combined reliability-weighted view contains more information than any of the individual views taken on its own and thus provides an improved basis for subsequent actions . The trained model allows us to interpret behavioral and neuronal data from cue integration experiments through a Bayesian lens and to make specific predictions about both system behavior and single cell dynamics . Whether inputs from neurons with different receptive fields or inputs from different modalities ( Fig 1a ) , our cortex needs to combine these uncertain information sources into a coherent basis that enables informed actions . Furthermore , while this computation relies on bidirectional coupling between neuronal compartments , at the level of the neuronal input-output transfer function , the effective computation can be described in a feed-forward manner . In our theoretical framework we derive somatic membrane potential dynamics and synaptic plasticity jointly via stochastic gradient ascent on the log-posterior distribution of somatic potentials . We suggest that each dendritic compartment , here interpreted as logical subdivision of a complex morphology , represents either a ( Gaussian ) likelihood function or a ( Gaussian ) prior distribution over somatic potentials . Bayesian probability theory provides clear recipes for how to optimally solve such problems , but so far the implementation in the biological substrate is unclear . In our approach , synapses not only learn to reproduce a somatic target activity , but they also adjust synaptic weights to achieve some target variance in the somatic potential . Furthermore , afferents with low reliability will be adjusted to
[RESULTS] For fixed presynaptic activity r , the average somatic membrane potential hence represents a maximum-a-posteriori estimate ( MAP , ) , while its variance is inversely proportional to the total somatic conductance g ¯ s. The effective time constant of the somatic dynamics is τ = C / g ¯ s , thus enabling us to converge faster to reliable MAP estimates for larger g ¯ s. The dynamics derived here from Bayesian inference ( Eq 3 ) are identical to the somatic membrane potential dynamics in bidirectionally coupled multi-compartment models with
[DISCUSSION] ( ii ) Synaptic plasticity for certainty learning : to test whether the mean and variance of the somatic potential can be learned by dendritic input , one may consider extracellular stimulation of mixed excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic afferents of a neuron while clamping the somatic potential to a fluctuating target . Extending this predictive view , we argue that dendrites themselves can be seen as performing a dendritic 'opinion pooling ' , namely forming dendritic opinions on the stimulus feature , weighting them according to their reliability , and predicting the somatic opinion that is imposed by the teacher input . Our plasticity rule predicts that initially , when the mean of the target distribution is not yet matched , excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strengths move in opposite directions , i. e. , one increases , the other decreases , to jointly match the average somatic membrane potential to the target potential ( cf . Our framework demonstrates that the conductance-based nature of synaptic coupling may not be an artifact of the biological substrate , but rather enables single neurons to perform efficient probabilistic inference previously thought to be realized only at the circuit level . ( i ) Certainty representation within a neuron : in response to individual whisker touches , our model implies that the somatic potential of somatosensory neurons is driven towards a stimulus-specific reversal potential ; this is consistent with measurements in mouse barrel

[ABSTRACT] Using our Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains ( ECOD ) from experimental structures as a basis for classification , we describe the detection and cataloging of domains from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database . Additionally , we compare the sampling of homologous groups from this whole proteome set against our stable ECOD reference and discuss groups that have been enriched by structure predictions . On average , we can provide positive classification ( either of domains or other identifiable non-domain regions ) for 90 % of residues in all proteomes . We enumerate those highly populated domains that are shared in both eukaryotes and bacteria , such as the Rossmann domains , TIM barrels , and P-loop domains . In addition to containing a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains , eukaryotes show a higher proportion of repeated proteins , both globular and small repeats . We classified 746 , 349 domains from 536 , 808 proteins comprised of over 226 , 424 , 000 amino acid residues . Finally , we discuss the implication of these results for protein target selection for future classification strategies for very large protein sets . Large-scale domain annotation of these predictions can aid in the development of biological insights . Protein structure prediction has now been deployed widely across several different large protein sets . We examine the varying populations of homologous groups in both eukaryotes and bacteria .
[INTRODUCTION] Since its release in 2020 , it has been used to generate and make available numerous data sets through the AlphaFold Structural Database hosted by the EBI , including 48 whole proteomes , numerous curated proteins within the SWISS-PROT dataset , and 200M predictions representing the known protein universe . Protein domain classifications determine and organize these homologous domains and either 1 ) sequence classifications such as Pfam , CDD , or SUPERFAMILY that partition protein sequence into domains and derive their taxonomy principally by sequence similarity measures or 2 ) structure classifications such as SCOP , CATH , or ECOD that use structural similarity to determine more distant homology ( at the cost of access to fewer proteins ) . Previous efforts using a prior version of the AF2 inference model ( v1 ) and a smaller selection of 21 proteomes have found that in a large percentage ( 92 % ) of models , these proteomes can be partitioned into domains and assigned to the existing CATH hierarchy . The outstanding performance of DeepMind 's AlphaFold2 at CASP14 [ 16-18 ] led to the subsequent development of software such as RoseTTAFold , ESMFold , and I-TASSER-MTD as well as the widespread prediction of large protein sets resulting in resources such as the AlphaFold Structure database ( AFDB ) and ESM-Atlas . Finally , we illustrate those homologous groups that are enriched by domains and use well-known sequence domain annotations to estimate the degree to which structure prediction of proteins and classification of their domains has expanded our knowledge of previously unknown domains . The division of predicted
[DISCUSSION] With even larger data sets ahead of us in the future , we consider broader representative sets encompassing the entire known protein universe , or classifications from multiple versions of the same computational method , or different methods altogether , we will need to tighten our criteria for selection to include only proteins representative of large clusters of unclassified proteins . Although the number of structures has dramatically increased in the intervening years ( from 94 , 914 to 179 , 295 ) and the fraction of domains in ECOD coming from EM structures also has increased ( from 1 % to 9 % ) , we did not observe a significant change in the relative ranks ( by non-redundant F70 population ) of the most populated homologous groups resulting from this change in methodological focus ( Fig 4B ) . A principal difference between the eukaryotic and bacterial populations is that in eukaryotes the selective pressure against repetition and duplication is lower , and the differences between most populated eukaryotic and bacterial homologous domains reflect those homologous groups that are found repetitively ( i. e. , as multiple neighbors within the same protein ) in eukaryotes such as the Igl domains , ARM repeats , and BBA and RING Zn fingers . The lower classification rate for domains in eukaryotes from AFDB predicted proteomes has previously been observed and is likely due to some combination of prediction errors as well as contextual
[METHODS] Several inter-residue measures , such as inter-residue distance , PAE , and shared membership within HHsearch and DALI hits in an ECOD reference set are converted into probabilities for two residues to be within the same domain based on regression analyses on the benchmark ECOD domains . These structures were classified into domains using the most recent version of the DPAM classification pipeline , previous versions",,880,92,None,"Protein structure prediction has been widely used across several large protein sets .

[ABSTRACT] Together , these findings suggest a model for polyomavirus replication , where robust viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and that BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication . The current model is that BKPyV expresses TAg ( large T antigen ) early during infection , promoting cells to enter S phase where the viral DNA can access the host replication machinery . By using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication , we show that both TAg expression and viral production rely on an initial S phase . We found that these subsequent rounds of replication of the host DNA relied on canonical host cell cycle machinery and regulators despite BKPyV infection . BKPyV is known to promote cellular re-replication , where the cell re-enters S phase from G2 phase ( without passing through mitosis or G1 phase ) to prolong S phase for viral replication . Here , we performed a single-cell analysis of viral TAg expression throughout the cell cycle to reveal that robust TAg expression required replication of the host DNA first . Having a better understanding of the molecular events that are required for BKPyV production will help identify effective therapeutic targets against BKPyV . BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure , for which there are no antivirals . Thus , BKPyV infection results in cells with greater than 4N DNA content .
[INTRODUCTION] To understand how BKPyV manages to replicate host DNA despite DDR activation , we used single-cell techniques to characterize the cell cycle during a BKPyV infection of human primary renal kidney epithelial ( RPTE ) cells , which are the site of natural infection in humans . Using dual-pulse labeling to track an initial S phase population throughout the cell cycle revealed a rapid accumulation of TAg as cells entered G2 , which was followed by VP2/3 expression . Our analysis of the cell cycle in BKPyV infected RPTE cells revealed that robust expression of TAg was primarily observed in the re-replicating population , which suggested that robust TAg expression depended on an initial host S phase . MCM licensing is tightly regulated by both transcription and protein degradation to prevent re-licensing of newly synthesized DNA in S phase ; ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once per cell cycle . Importantly , the re-replication phenotype of the host DNA is also found in kidney biopsies from transplant patients with uncontrolled BKPyV reactivation , in which enormous , TAg+ nuclei are observed . BKPyV replication using TAg and host replication machinery activates a cascade of kinases known as the DNA damage response ( DDR ) , which prolongs S phase and is necessary for robust viral replication . Therefore , it is unknown how BKPyV induces re-replication without causing increased DNA damage , or how the virus blocks mitosis by activating the DDR without also inhibiting Cdc7 and Cdk2 . Together , these data inform a
[RESULTS] Quantification of the TAg+ cells within the BrdU+ population at each timepoint revealed that , while the percent of TAg+ cells remained unchanged between 30 and 36hpi , there was a rapid increase in the number of TAg+ cells at 39hpi corresponding with an exit from S phase and entering G2 ( Fig 2D and 2E ) . Since robust levels of TAg were only observed in S phase cells that had ≥4N DNA content ( Fig 1E and 1F ) and suppression of host replication prior to
[DISCUSSION] While we did not find that BKPyV infection increased MAPK activation following attachment ( S5 Fig ) nor did we observe any difference in S phase induction until > 24 hours post-infection ( Fig 1 ) , it is possible that a later step during infection , such as escape from the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear entry , activates MAPK to drive the initial S phase prior to BKPyV transcription . While the timing of origin firing preceding DDR activation explains how new origins of replication are licensed and fired during a BKPyV infection , it raises the question as to how an initial mitosis is blocked if DDR is not activated until after re-replication has begun . Additionally , inhibiting host replication did not result in the accumulation of TAg expression in the G1/early S phase population , but prevented robust TAg expression all together and reduced viral titers ; demonstrating that TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase . Although , we can not rule out the possibility that low levels of TAg are sufficient to promote S phase by inhibition of pRb , we posit that low TAg levels are unlikely to promote S phase given that the human genome contains 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 E2F1 binding sites . While our data agree that TAg expression is observed before the viral capsid

[ABSTRACT] While most existing TWAS approaches focus on marginal analyses through examining one gene at a time , recent developments in TWAS fine-mapping methods enable the joint modeling of multiple genes to refine the identification of potentially causal ones . FABIO employs a probit model to directly link the genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) of genes to binary outcomes while taking into account the GReX correlation among all genes residing on a chromosome . Here , we present FABIO , a TWAS fine-mapping method specifically designed for binary traits that is capable of modeling all genes jointly on an entire chromosome . Leveraging its improved power , FABIO successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases , including GATA3 for asthma , ABCG2 for gout , and SH2B3 for hypertension . We performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of FABIO and applied it for in-depth analyses of six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank . However , these fine-mapping methods have primarily focused on modeling quantitative traits and examining local genomic regions , leading to potentially suboptimal performance . Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) . As a result , FABIO effectively controls false discoveries while offering substantial power gains over existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches . In the real datasets , FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27 . Overall , FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits . 9 % over existing approaches across traits . 9 % -36 .
[INTRODUCTION] When applied to binary disease traits , both FOCUS and FOGS still apply a linear regression framework to model the association between multiple GReX and the binary outcome trait ( S1 Text ) , relying on input of marginal GWAS summary statistics generated from either linear regression or logistic regression . Moreover , focusing solely on GReX of genes located within local genomic regions thus may miss causal genes located in other genomic regions that also contribute to the trait of interest , potentially leading to unnecessarily increase in residual error variance and subsequent loss of power . Therefore , modeling multiple genes on an entire chromosome may be advantageous in capturing GReX correlations that are not captured by modeling small genomic regions individually , thereby potentially increasing the power of TWAS fine-mapping . Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have gained significant popularity in the field of genetics as they are capable of integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) to uncover potentially causal associations between genes and traits [ 1-3 ] . Such linear modeling approach of TWAS aligns with the common practice in GWAS association analysis , as a linear regression can be viewed as an effective approximation to logistic regression when effect sizes are small . The first limitation is that these methods were primarily designed to model quantitative traits , which are traits that can be measured on a continuous scale , such as height or blood pressure
[RESULTS] In terms of the genetic architecture underlying gene expression , we found that FABIO still identified more true signal genes through 95 % credible set than FOCUS ( S4A Fig ) , and all methods had better performance with decreased number of SNPs with non-zero effects on gene expression which is equivalent to increased SNP effect sizes , though their rank again did not change ( S4B and S4C Fig ) . Different from existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches , FABIO explicitly models the binary nature of
[DISCUSSION] While requiring individual-level data may restrict the application of FABIO , it helps mitigate biases commonly observed in methods that make use of only GWAS summary statistics in the presence of a LD matrix mismatch between the reference panel and the analyzed GWAS data . Unlike existing approaches , FABIO not only incorporates a probit model to capture the binary nature of disease traits but also jointly models all genes on the same chromosome to account for GReX correlation across genes in different LD blocks . Secondly , similar to FOCUS and FOGS , FABIO adopts a two-stage fitting strategy for TWAS fine-mapping : it relies on a reference eQTL mapping study to construct the gene expression prediction model in the first stage , and applies the SNP weights inferred in the eQTL mapping study to construct GReX in the GWAS data for TWAS fine-mapping in the second stage . First , we calculated the pairwise correlation of GReX for four distinct groups of gene pairs : those within each LD block , between two adjacent LD blocks , between two distant LD blocks , and between one LD block on chromosome 1 and one on chromosome 2 , with the latter serving as a baseline . Second , for all six binary traits examined in our real data analysis , we computed
[METHODS] In the simulations , we first examined the calibration of test statistics from different methods under two null simulation settings : one is the complete null setting , where we set PVE2 = 0 % so that none of the genes were associated with the trait ; the other is a masked null setting , where we randomly selected 10 LD",,972,97,None,"Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have gained significant popularity in the field of genetics as they are capable of integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide associations studies ( GWAS ) to uncover potentially causal associations between genes and traits .

[ABSTRACT] Instead , both amorphous and amyloid Sup35 aggregates are increased in btn2 hsp42 mutants consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress conditions in the absence of sequestrase activity . We have identified the Sup35 translation termination factor as an in vivo sequestrase substrate and show that Btn2 and Hsp42 act to suppress oxidant-induced formation of the yeast [ PSI+ ] prion , which is the amyloid form of Sup35 . [ PSI+ ] prion formation in sequestrase mutants does not require IPOD ( insoluble protein deposit ) localization which is the site where amyloids are thought to undergo fragmentation and seeding to propagate their heritable prion form . When misfolded proteins evade quality control , they can be sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent the potential dysfunction and toxicity that arises from protein aggregation . Btn2 and Hsp42 act to sequester oxidized proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure and their absence leads to an accumulation of protein aggregates . Taken together , our data identify protein sequestration as a key antioxidant defence mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation . We show here that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress conditions induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide . The toxicity of protein aggregate accumulation causes oxidant sensitivity in btn2 hsp42 sequestrase mutants since overexpression of the Hsp104 disaggregase rescues oxidant tolerance . Their exact intracellular functions and substrates are not well defined , particularly since heat stress sensitivity is not observed in deletion mutants . Btn2 and Hsp42 are compartment-specific sequestrases that play key roles in the assembly of these deposition sites . Misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms .
[INTRODUCTION] We show that the levels of protein oxidative damage formed in response to oxidative stress are similar in wild-type and sequestrase mutants , but protein aggregation is elevated suggesting that the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases normally act to sequester oxidatively damaged proteins as part of the cells antioxidant defence system . The sequestration of misfolded proteins into intracellular deposit sites helps cells to cope with an accumulation of misfolded proteins by partitioning them away from their normal productive pathways , protecting against potential cytotoxic effects and by facilitating targeted degradation . Although aggregation is a well-studied phenomenon and many key players are known , it remains unclear exactly how different growth and stress conditions cause protein aggregation and the degree of stress specificity in the chaperone response to aggregate formation is unknown . Despite the established roles for Hsp42 and Btn2 as cellular sequestrases , their exact intracellular functions have remained elusive , especially since no growth defects have been observed in deletion mutants including a lack of sensitivity to heat stress . Btn2 has been shown to form high-molecular-weight complexes reminiscent of sHsp oligomers and similarly exhibits chaperone activity by associating with misfolded reporter proteins to increase their reactivation by Hsp70-Hsp100 chaperones . Its name derives from the finding that it is upregulated in response to loss of BTN1 , which encodes an ortholog of a human Batten disease protein implicated in progressive neurodegeneration and early death . Proteins targeted to CytoQ and
[RESULTS] When we expressed ΔN-SUP35-GFP as the sole copy of SUP35 under the control of its endogenous promoter , we found that the number of Sup35 puncta in the wild-type strain was comparable for both wild-type Sup35 and Sup35 lacking its PrD indicating that the prion domain is not required for Sup35 puncta formation in wild-type strains ( Fig 6C ) . The btn2 hsp42 mutant used in this study was constructed in a [ PIN+ ] [ psi- ] strain and we found that
[DISCUSSION] De novo prion formation following protein oxidation depends on IPOD localization which acts as a sorting centre determining whether oxidized proteins are cleared via autophagy , or alternatively , form heritable protein aggregates ( prions ) , dependent on Hsp104 ( Fig 7 ) . Our model is that soluble proteins , such as Sup35 , undergo misfolding in response to oxidative damage , and the oxidatively damaged proteins are normally triaged by Btn2 and Hsp42 to the various protein deposit sites in cells ( Fig 7 ) . Secondly , chaperones and other anti-prion systems may become overwhelmed by the high levels of non-specific protein aggregates present in btn2 hsp42 mutants meaning they are not available to suppress [ PSI+ ] prion formation . Peroxiredoxins normally act as antioxidant enzymes that detoxify hydroperoxides , but can also become hyperoxidized in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure which triggers a switch to high molecular weight structures with chaperone activity . These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive and are analogous to the cross-seeding and titration models that have been proposed to explain the requirement for [ PIN+ ] in de novo induction of [ PSI+ ] formation . For example , Hsp42 is required for the formation of cytosolic granules , termed MitoStores , which are formed in response to
[METHODS] [ psi− ] strains are auxotrophic for adenine and appear red due to the accumulation of an intermediate in the adenine biosynthesis pathway , whereas , [ PSI+ ] strains give rise to white/pink Ade+ colonies due to suppression of the ade1-14 nonsense mutation and production of functional Ade1 protein .

[ABSTRACT] We leveraged CRISPR-interference ( CRISPRi ) to evaluate invasive function of GBM-associated lncRNAs in an unbiased functional screen , characterizing and exploring the mechanism of identified candidates . RNAseq analysis of LINC03045 knockdown revealed that WASF3 , previously implicated in tumor invasion studies , was highly correlated with lncRNA expression , while WASF3 KD was associated with significant decrease in invasion . Mediators of lncRNA effect were identified via differential expression analysis following lncRNA KD and assessed for tumor invasion using knockdown and rescue experiments . Glioblastoma ( GBM ) invasion studies have focused on coding genes , while few studies evaluate long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) , transcripts without protein-coding potential , for role in GBM invasion . Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and Genotype-Tissue Expression ( GTEx ) survival analysis . 7 % decrease in tumor cell invasion upon knockdown , while LINC03045 expression was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade . We implemented a CRISPRi lncRNA loss-of-function screen evaluating association of lncRNA knockdown ( KD ) with invasion capacity in Matrigel . Top screen candidates were validated using CRISPRi and oligonucleotide ( ASO ) -mediated knockdown in three tumor lines . RNA-seq and mechanistic studies suggest that this novel lncRNA may regulate invasion via WASF3 . Finally , WASF3 overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive function lost with LINC03045 KD . The top candidate , LINC03045 , identified from effect size and p-value , demonstrated 82 . CRISPRi screening identified LINC03045 , a previously unannotated lncRNA , as critical to GBM invasion . Forty-eight lncRNAs were significantly associated with 33-83 % decrease in invasion ( p < 0 . Gene expression is significantly associated with tumor grade and survival . 01 ) upon knockdown .
[INTRODUCTION] Standard of care treatment includes surgical resection , chemotherapy with temozolomide ( TMZ ) , and radiation therapy , but despite the available therapeutic options , mean survival remains at about 12 to 15 months and the five-year survival rate at 5 . The majority of GBM patients also invariably experience tumor recurrence with increased chemo- and radio-resistance , and there is no standardized second line of management after initial adjuvant treatment . Glioblastoma ( GBM ) is the most common and aggressive adult primary malignant brain tumor , with an estimated annual incidence of 17 , 000 new cases per year in the USA . We further assess the clinical association of candidate lncRNAs with tumor grade and patient outcomes while also evaluating potential mechanisms by finding associations of candidate lncRNAs with potential coding genes affecting GBM invasion . Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) are transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides that do not code for proteins but have demonstrated involvement in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation . Due to the nature of non-coding RNAs , standard CRISPR knockdown may not effectively limit lncRNA function , as small deletions do not typically reduce lncRNA-induced effects . CRISPRi ( CRISPR interference ) circumvents this challenge , repressing transcription of the lncRNA at the nucleus via fusion of a catalytically inactive Cas9 ( dCas9 ) with a repressive KRAB domain . While current genetic studies in glioma research have primarily focused on targeting coding genes
[RESULTS] To determine the lncRNAs with the most notable effects on invasion , screen scores , which were defined as the average phenotype of the top three sgRNAs for a given gene multiplied by the negative log10 ( Mann-Whitney p-value ) , were compared to non-targeting controls and plotted on a volcano plot , with the dashed lines representing the threshold to determine screen hits ( Figs 1B and S1 ) . Notably , all analyses were also adjusted for IDH-status , MGMT methylation and
[DISCUSSION] In addition , because lncRNAs have been commonly characterized as extremely abundant and specific to a small subset of cells , another possible explanation is that gene expression was particularly abundant in an aggressive , invading , lncRNA-rich subpopulation is capable of demonstrating invasion at 24 hours during the assay . Additionally , given the technical challenges of conducting long-term lentiviral knockdown of lncRNAs in vivo , including target specificity and the instability of lentiviral transduction of the LINC03045 knockdown , we have chosen to utilize 3D invasion assays as an approximation of in vivo behavior , which allowed for stable , continuous knockdown of LINC03045 via ASO [ 53-55 ] . When evaluating the intersection between differential gene expression in LINC03045 KD in vitro and LINC03045 expression changes in vivo ( in the TCGA ) , we noted an overlap of 16 out of the 36 differentially expressed genes in vitro , with significant alterations in GO pathways in cell shape and neural crest cell migration ( S1 Table ) . Prior studies have found that aberrations in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation could contribute to GBM aggressiveness and invasion and that an acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironment can promote tumor invasion by changing glycolytic flux , thus promoting local protumorigenic inflammatory responses .

[ABSTRACT] We address this issue by using a new clustering procedure for sets of electroencephalographic ( EEG ) data recorded from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain . This clustering procedure indicates that the brain uses the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus in order to build a model . An important issue associated with this conjecture is the identification of the classes of models used by the brain to perform this task . It has been classically conjectured that the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli .
[INTRODUCTION] In neuroscience , clustering procedures have been applied solve challenges such as categorizing average EEG signals collected in different experimental conditions , or finding temporal segmentation in the EEG signals recorded from participants at rest . In the procedure to generate the sequence of auditory stimuli is defined by a context tree and an associated family of transition probabilities used to choose each next stimulus given the context associated to the sequence of past stimuli at each time step . We propose to address this question by using a new clustering procedure for sets of EEG data collected while participants were exposed to sequences of auditory stimuli driven by a context tree . The first stage is at the individual level , where sets of segments of the EEG signal per participant are grouped using a new distance between the distribution of sets of functional data inspired by the projective method . Our results show that regions of the pre-frontal cortex of the brain effectively use the occurrence of the strong beat to identify the structure embedded in the sequence of stimuli , with a more predominant role of the right hemisphere . As a matter of fact , in the context tree model employed in , the strong beat appears regularly and its appearance is sufficient for the brain to predict the next auditory stimulus . By identifying natural groupings in data , clustering analysis allows to identify patterns and relationships , with applications in pattern recognition , data compression , biological and medical research and social sciences . It has been proposed that the brain identifies statistical regularities in sequences of stimuli and organises these regularities to be able to classify the stimuli and to make predictions . In spite of the interest of all these works , each one of them assumes a particular class of models used by the brain to
[RESULTS] To test whether the significance of the p-values obtained with these analyses depend on the α , β and ν parameters , we repeated the analysis three times , changing individually each parameter value from 0 . For each partition retrieved from a subset of electrodes , the probability of finding a partition at least as similar as the partition expected was numerically estimated with the method described in the 'Statistical significance of the consensus partitions ' section . The results in Table 1 reinforce the idea that the results obtained from the E R P F and E L F P agree with the partition P * ,

[ABSTRACT] While single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) is a popular method to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution , it harbors shortcomings : The failure to account for cell-to-cell variations of transcriptome-size ( i. e. , the total number of transcripts per cell ) and also cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression . Their fidelity is validated by more accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data of diverse solid organs using the scRNA-seq data and the cWFs of their composite cells . Here , we introduce a concept and a method of its computation and report cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs . This is particularly a problem when analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues/organs , which requires cell dissociation for the analysis . Our study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues/organs . Furthermore , we also show that cWFs effectively predict aging-progression , implicating their diagnostic applications and also their association with aging mechanism . To fix this problem , we propose a computationally calculated coefficient , `` cell type-specific weighting-factor ( cWF ) `` . As a result , there exists a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq result and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq result using its composite scRNA-seq data . Furthermore , our findings suggest a diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs .
[INTRODUCTION] In this study , we address and overcome these limitations/problems associated with solid tissues/organs by developing a method to compute coefficients , cell type-specific weighting-factors ( cWFs ) , to offset the transcriptome size- and cell dissociation/processing-induced problem . Due to such limitations , it is difficult to measure and compare the absolute transcript-counts of each gene in individual cells of the complex solid tissues/organs such as the heart , brain , kidney , etc . However , in scRNA-seq analyses , the transcripts are sequenced in individual cells and their transcript-counts are normalized , allowing the comparison of the relative abundance of each transcript-species across individual cells/cell-types [ 5-9 ] . Another study shows that the global transcription is repressed by the loss of MECP2 , a methyl CpG binding protein , in embryonic stem cell-derived neurons . Since the advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) technologies early this century , this method is becoming one of the essential tools in biomedical fields . Furthermore , we also calculate cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs and use them to illustrate their diagnostic and biological utilities . However , these approaches are applicable only to culture cells , blood/immune cells , and cancer cells which are relatively uniform cell types and do not require cell dissociation . In addition to the transcriptome-size , cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression is another problem with scRNA-seq , in particular with solid tissues/organs . This differential transcriptome-size can be determined by counting the library depth of the cells and/or by including normalizing spike-in RNA in the samples . This internal normalization process of
[DISCUSSION] We show that they indeed account for the relative variations of the transcriptome-size of the cells and their differential cryptic gene expression by demonstrating their requisite role for accurately reconstituting and deconvolving the whole-organ RNA-seq data using their composite scRNA-seq data weighted by the corresponding cWFs ( Figs 4-6 ) . Furthermore , we show at least one example where the expected pathological changes of the cell-type ratio of the heart can be predicted using the cWFs derived from the healthy control heart ( S8 Fig ) , despite a bias introduced by this reference data . In this study , we report a computational method to calculate cWFs , coefficients to offset the lack of the representation of transcriptome size variations and differential cryptic gene expression among different cells of solid organs ( Fig 2 ) . Furthermore , we show that cWFs differentially change among diverse cell-types across various organs over the course of aging and can be used to effectively predict aging progression in the aging mouse model ( Figs 8-10 ) . Another requirement is that the method needs at least a rough a priori knowledge about the cell-type compositions ( i. e. , the ratio of cell-types ) of the organs and the tissue of interest -i. e. , the method works only in a supervised framework . While our method is effective for the organs consisting of heterogeneous cell-types , it is ineffective for a relatively homogenous organ such
[METHODS] One noticeable difference is that the increase of m appears to slightly improve the Pearson correlation coefficients ( S2 Fig ) , suggesting a benefit of increasing m. The similar improvement was found with additional organ RNA-seq datasets ( S3 Fig ) , further supporting the notion that the method does not necessarily require both whole-organ RNA-seq and the corresponding scRNA-seq data at the same time .",,871,92,None,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA ) is a popular method to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution .

Our study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of stRNA-Seq analysis of complex solid tissues/organs . Furthermore , our findings suggest a diagnostic utility and biological significance of c WFs , which are useful for analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues ."

[ABSTRACT] In combination with simulated examples , we highlight how important features of MVMR analyses can be explored using a range of tools incorporated within the RMVMR R package . MR and MVMR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants in the set used as instrumental variables , violating one of the core IV assumptions . We propose a radial formulation of MVMR , and an adapted Galbraith radial plot , which allows for the estimated effect of each exposure within an MVMR analysis to be visualised . Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a statistical approach using genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome . We present simulations that illustrate how outlier removal decreases the bias in estimated effects under various forms of pleiotropy . Radial MVMR effectively visualises causal effect estimates , and provides valuable diagnostic information with respect to the underlying assumptions of MVMR . Radial MVMR additionally includes an option for removal of outlying SNPs which may violate one or more assumptions of MVMR . We highlight how outliers with respect to all exposures can be visualised and removed through Radial MVMR . Analogous plots for MVMR have so far been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature of the analysis . We apply Radial MVMR to estimate the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Multivariable MR ( MVMR ) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simulatiously . Genetic variants that give outlying estimates are often considered to be potentially pleiotropic variants . We demonstrate the effectiveness of the radial MVMR approach through simulations and applied analyses . A RMVMR R package is presented as accompanying software for implementing the methods described . Radial plots can be used in MR to help identify these variants .
[INTRODUCTION] We then show how the application of Radial MVMR can be used to visualise the MVMR results and to obtain more robust effect estimates through the identification and removal of SNPs which contribute more to heterogenetiy in the MVMR results than would be expected by chance . Multivariable MR ( MVMR ) is an extension to standard MR estimation which allows for the inclusion of multiple exposures , estimating the direct effect of each exposure on the outcome of interest , conditional on the other exposures included in the model [ 8-10 ] . In this paper we present a Radial MVMR approach which allows for visualisation of the effects obtained in MVMR and identification of SNPs that are outlying based on their association with all of the exposures . Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a methodological framework in which genetic variants- often single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) - are used as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding . Radial MR has previously been proposed as a method for MR that allows for visualisation and removal of outliers , as measured by the SNPs that contribute more than expected by chance to heterogeneity in the analysis . Heterogeneity in the per-SNP causal effects estimates is often taken to be an indication of violation of the IV assumptions and potential evidence of pleiotropic effects biasing the estimates obtained for some SNPs . SNPs that contribute to this heterogeneity by more than would be expected by chance are often considered
[DISCUSSION] This issue , which is a wider issue within the summary MR literature , warrants careful consideration prior to performing analyses , and care should be taken in evaluating as an indicator of pleiotropy when a binary outcome is used . We propose that the radial MVMR approach be used to assist in communicating key findings as a visual aid , and also as a sensitivity analysis for identifying pleiotropic bias using adjusted heterogeneity statistics . It is with this in mind that a general heterogeneity pruning function has not been incorporated within the RMVMR R package , though code for performing such analyses is available at https : //github . When using SNP-outcome associations estimated on a log-odds scale , it is possible that causal estimates will be correlated with their precision , introducing heterogeneity which is not a consequence of pleiotropic associations . Heterogeneity in per SNP effect estimates can arise due to mechanisms other than horizontal pleiotropy , for example tissue specificity in the SNP effects will lead to heterogeneity when the samples are taken from a single tissue . Such weights may prove more effective than first-order weights , as they incorporate the precision of SNP-exposure estimates mitigating violations of the NO-Measurement Error ( NOME ) assumption in summary MR . If a majority of instruments have direct effects upon an outcome , and the distribution
[METHODS] For a MVMR with k exposures , the direct effect of each exposure can be estimated by regressing instrument-outcome associations upon instrument-exposure associations for each exposure simultaneously , such that : Γ ^ j = β I V W 1 γ ^ 1 j + β I V W 2 γ ^ 2 j + … + β I V W k γ",,931,95,None,"Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a statistical approach using genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome .

[ABSTRACT] Using our holistic measurements of behavior , we find that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies ' daily pattern of behavior , and that the behavioral composition of this hour tracks well with other indicators of health such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spend moving vs. resting . We find distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors , adding specific information about trends in different grooming modalities , proboscis extension duration , and locomotion speed to what is known about the D. melanogaster circadian cycle . To access longer timescales of behavior , we continuously recorded individual Drosophila melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless arenas on sucrose-agarose media . The method , data , and analysis presented here give us a new and clearer picture of D. melanogaster behavior across timescales , revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms . We identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming , proboscis extension , and locomotion and use the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies ' behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment . We use the deep learning framework SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances . Animal behavior spans many timescales , from short , seconds-scale actions to daily rhythms over many hours to life-long changes during aging .
[INTRODUCTION] In D. melanogaster , simple experimental setups , such as beam-break assays allow for continuous monitoring of activity levels over days , but fail to capture the high-resolution data necessary for modern techniques of behavior analysis such as MotionMapper , B-SOiD , VAME , or Keypoint-MoSeq . Our findings , particularly with regards to the ethological distinction between the morning and evening , offer a new window into the hourly and daily patterns of D. melanogaster activity , and represent a significant step forward in our ability to quantify the inherently multi-timescale structure of animal behavior . We tracked 14 body parts from each fly using SLEAP and utilized MotionMapper , an unsupervised machine-learning method , to develop data-driven definitions of stereotyped behavioral states , such as grooming , locomoting , and proboscis extension . These studies are able to provide longitudinal behavioral data , but are limited in their ability to identify discrete behavioral states , generally adding an additional non-locomotion/non-idle state which is labeled as `` grooming '' or `` micromovement '' . When studying fine-grained behavioral variation at longer timescales , previous work utilized short high-resolution recordings taken from different individuals with ages distributed across the lifespan of the animal and unsupervised behavioral classifications . Animals carry out sequences of behaviors on many timescales , from the short timescales of the individual movements required for grooming , eating , and social communication to the longer timescales of hunger , arousal , diurnal cycles , mating seasons , and the aging process . On the other hand , the acquisition of high-resolution data has been restricted to
[DISCUSSION] While the study presented here does not carry out the necessary genetic and lighting perturbations , it would be interesting to see if locomotion time and locomotion speed are independently controlled mechanisms that together contribute to the typical morning and evening peaks of behavior in D. melanogaster . By leveraging recent advances in GPU-based video processing and postural inference , we captured the behavior of freely moving D. melanogaster over the course of multiple days , encompassing the behavioral effects of daily rhythms , starvation , aging , and habituation at continuous high resolution . The analyses presented here leverage only a fraction of the resolution and dimensionality provided by our data , and we hope this 100-fold increase in the amount of high-quality ethological data available will give rise to yet more tools and techniques . While in this study we can not distinguish between feeding and sleep associated proboscis extensions , we hypothesize that the increased bout duration during night hours is associated with a deep sleep mode that flies are achieving more frequently at night . This dataset is also the first to continuously capture high dimensional , high-resolution behavioral data across a diurnal cycle , allowing us to investigate how changes in internal state related to time of day affect behavior . Future work with new arenas , food sources , and improved environmental control can extend this type of high-resolution behavioral recordings to cover a broad set
[METHODS] In order to provide a flag for time points when the flies are on the edge and tracking fidelity is compromised we used the MATLAB Classification Learner App to train an SVM to identify whether flies are on or off the edge based on the all-by-all distances between tracked body coordinates ( excluding the proboscis ) , the speed of each body coordinate , and the",,899,93,None,"Animal behavior spans many timescales , from short , seconds-scale actions to daily rhythms over many hours to life-long changes during aging .

[ABSTRACT] Through a non-biased genetic screen , we found that loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 ( human NEK8/NEK9 ) and NEKL-3 ( human NEK6/NEK7 ) , which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation . Genetic analysis , co-localization studies , and proximity labeling revealed roles for PTPN-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes , including C. elegans hemidesmosomes , suggesting that PTPN-22 plays a broad role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues . Localization and proximity labeling also implicated PTPN-22 in functions connected to nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation , particularly within the germline , as nearly one-third of proteins identified by PTPN-22 proximity labeling are known P granule components . Protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type ( PTPNs ) have been studied extensively in the context of the adaptive immune system ; however , their roles beyond immunoregulation are less well explored . Here we identify novel functions for the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTPN-22 , establishing its role in nematode molting , cell adhesion , and cytoskeletal regulation . Through this approach we identified the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 ( human DNMBP ) as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22 . To better understand the functions of PTPN-22 , we carried out proximity labeling studies to identify candidate interactors of PTPN-22 during development . Collectively , these studies highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions . Consistent with this interaction , loss of DNBP-1 also suppressed nekl-associated molting defects .
[INTRODUCTION] Further insights into the functions of NEKLs came from the isolation of genetic suppressors of nekl molting defects , which include core components of the endocytic machinery and several closely associated factors that regulate actin filamentation , including the Rho-family GTPase CDC-42 and its effector SID-3 , which is the ortholog of human TNK2 ( tyrosine kinase non receptor 2 ; also known as ACK1 , activated CDC42-associated kinase 1 ) [ 40-42 ] . Previous work in our laboratory identified two conserved Serine-Threonine-specific NIMA-related kinases , NEKL-2 ( human NEK8/NEK9 ) and NEKL-3 ( human NEK6/NEK7 ) ( collectively referred to as the NEKLs ) -along with their three ankyrin repeat binding partners , MLT-2 ( human ANKS6 ) , MLT-3 ( human ANKS3 ) , and MLT-4 ( human INVS ) ( collectively referred to as the MLTs ) -as being required for molting . Moreover , a missense polymorphism in PTPN22 , which leads to a R620W substitution in the C terminus of PTPN22 , is a common risk factor for multiple autoimmune diseases including type I diabetes mellitus , systemic lupus erythematosus , and rheumatoid arthritis [ 20-24 ] . Using genetic , proteomic , and cell biological approaches , we have implicated PTPN-22 in a range of functions including effects on epidermal adhesion complexes , cytoskeletal proteins , and potential germline expression functions , thereby expanding substantially on the known functions of PTPN22 family members . PTPN22 expression is also detected in epithelial , endothelial ,
[RESULTS] Gene ontology analysis of the 179 PTPN-22 : :TurboID-associated proteins indicated statistically significant enrichment of proteins acting within various molecular and cellular structures including the actin cytoskeleton , germline P granules , the NatC/N-terminal protein acetyltransferase complex , and the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein ( snRNP ) complex , among others ( S3 File ) . For our analysis , we used the non-specific biotin ligase TurboID , an improved version of the BirA enzyme with rapid labeling kinetics , which was fused to the C terminus
[DISCUSSION] Additionally , it is possible that an interaction between PTPN-22 , nuclear pore complex proteins , and importins could occur in other tissues , as we observed expression of PTPN-22 in nuclear compartments of other cell types including the vulva , pharynx , intestine , and seam cells . Our findings from proximity labeling , molecular modeling , and subcellular localization studies , in conjunction with previously published yeast two-hybrid interaction data , suggest that PTPN-22 may be an accessory component or regulator of this complex . As noted in the results , however , our proximity labeling studies are likely to contain at least some false ( non-specific ) positives , which could include highly abundant proteins such as those acting within cell adhesion complexes . We previously showed that NEKL-2 and NEKL-3 have overlapping but distinct roles in several steps of membrane trafficking including cargo uptake from apical and basolateral membranes along with transit through the endosomal system . Additionally , our genetic experiments revealed a robust genetic interaction between cap-2 and ptpn-22 , as loss of function of both proteins led to a significant increase in embryonic lethality and developmental arrest at early larval stages . DNMBP , the human ortholog of DNBP-1 , regulates actin assembly by serving as a scaffold for CDC42 and WASP family proteins and also binds to dynamin
[METHODS] To estimate the proportion of the four biotinylated carboxylases ( MCCC-1 , PCCA-1 , PYC-1 , and POD-2 ) in the MS samples we first averaged their individual abundance from the technical replicates ( e. g. , a1+a2+a3+a4/4 = aa ) , then converted these values from log2 scale ( 2^aa ) , and then summed these four values ( carboxylase-total )",,992,98,None,"Protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type ( PTPNs ) have been studied extensively in the context of the adaptive immune system; however , their roles beyond immunoregulation are less well explored .

[ABSTRACT] We use a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 ( K13 ) gene , which are known to be associated with artemisinin resistance , and a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artemisinin resistance . Our model and maps provide important insights into the spatial and temporal trends of artemisinin resistance in a way that is not possible using data alone , thereby enabling improved spatial decision support systems on an unprecedented fine-scale spatial resolution . By predicting for the first time spatio-temporal patterns and extents of artemisinin resistance at the subcontinent level , this study provides critical information for supporting malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia . Spatial information on the changing levels of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia is therefore critical for health organisations to prioritise malaria control measures , but available data on artemisinin resistance are sparse . Our maps of estimated prevalence show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022 . If artemisinin resistance significantly expands to Africa or India , cases and malaria-related deaths are set to increase substantially . Current malaria elimination targets must withstand a colossal challenge-resistance to the current gold standard antimalarial drug , namely artemisinin derivatives . Moreover , the period between 2010 and 2015 demonstrated the most spatial change across the region .
[INTRODUCTION] In 2014 , mutations in the propeller region of the K13 protein that are associated with slow parasite clearance response to artemisinins were identified and almost 200 different candidate mutant genotypes were established -a list that has been subsequently revised . Studies conducted in 2006-2007 first reported that P. falciparum in north-west Cambodia had reduced in vivo susceptibility to artemisinins , which manifested as delayed clearance of parasites from the blood of patients treated with ACTs . This situation is dire considering how the multi-foci emergence and spread of resistance to other antimalarial drugs-chloroquine and , later , sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) -have resulted in dramatic increases in malaria-related morbidity and mortality . The spatio-temporal maps of K13 marker prevalence presented in this paper will be able to support monitoring of drug resistance in Southeast Asia , appropriate targeting of preventive strategies and malaria elimination efforts . We develop a geostatistical model of the presence of molecular markers associated with artemisinin resistance , in the Kelch 13 ( K13 ) gene , calibrated to the most comprehensive dataset available from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network ( WWARN ) . A continuous predictive surface in space and time was inferred for dhps markers using Bayesian model-based geostatistics over the spatial domain of sub-Saharan Africa from 1990 to 2010 . P. falciparum infections with significantly slowed parasite clearance under artemisinin-based therapies have now been detected in neighbouring countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion ; namely in Vietnam , Thailand and Myanmar . Since the identification of K13 markers ,
[RESULTS] The median and uncertainty ( standard deviation ) of the distribution are shown in Fig 3 for the Greater Mekong Subregion in 2000 , 2010 and 2020 , in regions where the median estimate of parasite rate among those aged 2-10 years is predicted to be non-zero ( see Fig C in S1 Text for results over the entire Greater Mekong Subregion ) . We note that we could exclude regions based on other measures of malaria transmission that are more likely to reflect disease burden in the region
[DISCUSSION] With the sparsity of spatial data currently available this poor performance of long-range extrapolation is not unexpected and may be improved as ( 1 ) more spatial data is collected , ( 2 ) modelling methods are improved for example to consider multi-model outputs , and ( 3 ) potential explanatory variables become available at sufficiently high spatiotemporal resolution . However , these factors each have an important mechanistic role to play in the rate of change of artemisinin resistance , which could be modelled by considering another hierarchical layer in the statistical model that relates the level of resistance to , for example , the incidence of Pf malaria during a time interval . This will be possible with a joint statistical framework drawing on all the information available for each of the K13 markers for which the correlation structure between the markers is explicitly modelled ; currently there is very limited data with more than one molecular marker , so a joint model is beyond the scope of this paper with the existing data . Firstly , the timeline from field data collection to publication to data sharing was often long ; consequently , the modelling to provide real-time ( or near real-time ) information for policymakers was dependent on this factor and the willingness of all actors to allow rapid access to relevant data . This paper has

[ABSTRACT] Further functional assay indicated that although DPP9 is involved in the NT-CT complex of rodent NLRP1 and CARD8 , it does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT. Our study enhanced the understanding of the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation and underscored the complexity of their interactions within the immune response . Specifically , the Linker3 region located between LRR and FIIND in murine NLRP1b ( mNLRP1b ) plays an essential role in forming the NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes , while the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ) and CARD8 mediates their NT-CT interaction . These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain , resulting in full-length ( FL ) , cleaved N-terminal ( NT ) , and cleaved C-terminal ( CT ) peptides , which form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state . Function-to-find domain ( FIIND ) -containing proteins , including NLRP1 and CARD8 , are vital components of the inflammasome signaling pathway , critical for the innate immune response . Here , we found that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions , but with distinct mechanisms . In addition , we explored the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 ( DPP9 ) in these complexes , revealing differential interactions and the significance of domain structure . Besides the FL-DPP9-CT complex , DPP9 interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b , rNLRP1 , and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains , forming NT-DPP9-CT complex ; however , DPP9 can not bind to NTs of hNLRP1 . However , the detailed mechanism remains elusive .
[INTRODUCTION] Our recent study has also shown that hNLRP1 forms various autoinhibitory complexes with or without DPP9 , indicating the Linker1 region plays a significant role in mediating the association between hNLRP1NT and hNLRP1CT . Here , we utilized biochemistry approaches to characterize the autoinhibitory complexes of CARD8 and rodent NLRP1 variants , including mNLRP1b and rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ) , revealing that all of these proteins form both NT-CT and FL-CT complexes . Among the canonical inflammasome pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) , both NLRP1 and CARD8 contain a unique function-to-find domain ( FIIND ) , which undergoes autoproteolysis to yield two noncovalently associated polypeptides : the N terminus ( NT ) and the C terminus ( CT ) . In canonical inflammasome pathways , nucleotide-binding-oligomerization-domain-like receptors ( NLRs ) sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) or damage-associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) , typically activating caspase-1 through the adaptor protein Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD ( ASC ) . LT specifically cleaves the N-terminal fragment between amino acid 44 and 45 , which triggers the proteasomal degradation of mNLRP1bNT by the ubiquitin ligase UBR2 , liberating mNLRP1bCT for inflammasome assembly [ 9-11 ] . Moreover , hNLRP1 directly interacts with the structural protein ORF45 during Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) infection via the Linker1 region , leading to the disruption of autoinhibitory complexes and activation of the hNLRP1 inflammasome . Beyond viral infection , the hNLRP1 inflammasome also responds to ultraviolet
[RESULTS] In contrast with the behavior observed with hNLRP1 , the cleavage resistant mutants of mNLRP1b ( S984A ) , rNLRP1 ( S969A ) , and CARD8 ( S297A ) showed similar binding affinity to DPP9 as the respective wild-type proteins , suggesting the autocleavage within the FIIND domain is not necessary for the interaction between DPP9 and rodent NLPR1s or CARD8 ( Fig 2A-2C ) . Detailed mapping revealed that aa 85-145 of Linker3 ( corresponding to aa 789-849 in full-length mNLRP1b ) was responsible for
[DISCUSSION] The FIIND domain of FL proteins forms a relatively conserved ternary complex with the cleaved CT and the cellular protease DPP9 [ 22-24 ] , while NT utilizes different domains or regions to interact with and inhibit CT ( S4F Fig ) . In conclusion , our research elucidates that the formation of NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes in FIIND-containing proteins constitutes a sophisticated mechanism of regulation , presenting potential avenues for targeted therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with dysregulated inflammasome activation . Both NLRP1 paralogs and the CARD8 inflammasome can be activated by pathogenic proteases through a mechanism termed `` functional degradation '' , whereby these proteases cleave the NT , leading to the degradation of both NT and FL , thus liberating CT for inflammasome assembly [ 9-12 , 17 , 19 ] . Knockout studies indicate that NT retains its inhibitory effect on CT in the absence of DPP9 , and treatment with VbP does not activate the NT-DPP9-CT complex , suggesting that the primary inhibitory action of DPP9 for NLRP1 or CARD8 occurs through the FL-DPP9-CT complex . However , mNLRP1b , rNLRP1 , and CARD8 present a different profile , as both FL and NT can bind DPP9 with similar affinity , and mutations at the cleavage sites do not impact this interaction . Cellular DPP9 has been identified as

[ABSTRACT] In various growing tissues , cell competition based mechanisms facilitate detection and elimination of these compromised , often referred to as 'loser ' , cells by the healthier neighbors . Our results suggest that increased levels of Rer1 provide cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating the proteotoxic stress and thereby supporting Myc-driven overgrowth . Here , we reveal the function of an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi localized protein Rer1 in the regulation of protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium . In summary , these observations demonstrate that Rer1 acts as a novel regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila and reveal its role in competitive cell survival . Our results show that loss of Rer1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α . Interestingly , we find that Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression that causes overgrowth , albeit under high proteotoxic stress . Defects in protein homeostasis can induce proteotoxic stress , affecting cellular fitness and , consequently , overall tissue health . Clonal analysis showed that rer1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition . The precise connection between proteotoxic stress and competitive cell survival remains largely elusive .
[INTRODUCTION] These changes include , 1 ) reduced metabolic activity due to alteration in the mTOR pathway activity , 2 ) loss of apico-basal polarity as a consequence of mutations of the scribble , dlg , and lgl genes , 3 ) defects in endosomal trafficking caused by mutations in the rab5 gene , and 4 ) deregulation of signaling pathways such as Wnt , BMP , and Hippo [ 22-24 ] . Furthermore , we found that loss of Rer1 creates proteotoxic stress in the developing wing epithelium , and when surrounded by wild-type cells , the clonal population of rer1 mutant cells attained the loser fate and were eliminated specifically via the process of cell competition . Later studies have shown that Rer1 is also required for the assembly of multisubunit protein complexes , for example , the tetrameric γ-secretase complex , yeast iron transporter and skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) [ 37-42 ] . However , recent studies have shown that Rp+/- cells exhibit high proteotoxic stress [ 11-14 ] and activate the expression of bZip transcription factor Xrp-1 , which plays an essential role in the elimination of the Rp+/- cells . Mutations in the rer1 gene were first described in yeast , where it was identified in a screen as a factor required for proper transport of Sec12p between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi . This includes phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha ( eIF2α ) via PERK ( PKR-like ER kinase ) and induction of autophagy to reduce protein translation and
[RESULTS] Remarkably , these clones exhibit higher cell death at the clone boundary ( S3B'-S3B '' Fig see blue arrows ; quantified in S3C Fig ) and reduction in the clone size as compared to control ( S3D Fig ) , consistent with our observation in the rer1 mutant clones , indicating that loss of Rer1 could trigger cell competition . Notably , Dcp-1 positive cells were concentrated at the boundary of rer1-/-cells and neighboring control cells ( Fig 1H-1H ' see blue-arrows ; quantified in Fig 1K ; also see S2F-S2G
[DISCUSSION] This is in line with recent studies that have implicated mutations in genes , for example , RNA Helicase Hel25E , E3 ubiquitin ligase Mahjong and Rp mutations , in causing proteotoxic stress and subsequent elimination of mutant cells via cell competition . These results suggest that higher levels of Rer1 allowed cells to maintain the increased demand for proteostasis upon Myc-overexpression and thereby mitigating the proteotoxic stress and supporting the overgrowth ( Fig 9E-9G ) . Moreover , studies in yeast , worms and mouse cerebral cortex have shown that absence of Rer1 induces ER stress and activates the UPR pathways , suggesting a well-conserved function of Rer1 across species . Consistent with this , we found that either PERK depletion or dephosphorylation of p-eIF2α by the expression of GADD34 improved the fitness of rer1 mutant cells , indicating that these cells p-eIF2α played a maladaptive role . In any case , aligned with other studies , our work shows that proteotoxic stress , even without a reduction in protein translation , is sufficient to drive elimination of the loser rer1-/-cells . In contrast , blocking p-eIF2α by PERK depletion was shown to suppress the competitive elimination of wollknaeuel ( wol ) mutant clones ( wol is involved in the glycosylation of proteins in the ER ) , Hel25E mutant clones and RpL14+/- cells . In contrast , RpS3+/-mutants show reduced translation attributed to the transcription

[ABSTRACT] Most of the 3 , 188 unique amino acid changes that can result from non-synonymous single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) of CHEK2 , however , have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHEK2-enocded protein ( CHK2 ) . Here we tested all but two of the 4 , 887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame for their ability to complement RAD53 mutants using a high throughput technique of deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) . Combined , this approach can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance that are found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes . The results correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases . This approach has been used to provide functional information on over 100 CHEK2 SNVs and the results align with functional assays in human cells and known pathogenicity . One successful approach to testing the function of variants has been to test for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2 , RAD53 . Loss of function mutations in the checkpoint kinase gene CHEK2 are associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers . Among the non-synonymous changes , 770 were damaging to protein function while 2 , 417 were tolerated .
[INTRODUCTION] Several different functional assays have been used to test individual and small sets of CHK2 missense variants identified in patients , including tests of protein stability , kinase activity toward various substrates , and activation by DNA damaging agents [ 22 , 23 , 29-32 ] . Additionally , rad53 complementation assays using the DNA damaging agent , methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) have been performed to evaluate the functional impact of over 100 germline missense variants detected in familial breast cancer patients or selected from the ClinVar database [ 33-35 ] . This technique , also known as a multiplex assay of variant effects ( MAVE ) , has become a valuable tool to evaluate the impact of genetic variants on protein function and has been used in several studies to characterize human protein variants based on their function in yeast [ 39-43 ] . Most variants detected in susceptibility screening , however , lack supporting evidence by statistically significant population data to classify them as either pathogenic or benign , resulting in their classification as variants of uncertain significance ( VUS ) . Standards for the clinical classification of sequence variants established by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics ( ACMG ) use multiple pieces of evidence ( family history , allele frequency , segregation and functional data , etc . ) This phosphorylation induces dimerization of CHK2 monomers through the binding of the phosphorylated SCD of one CHK2 monomer with the FHA domain of another , initiating autophosphorylation within the
[RESULTS] These assays include complementation of yeast rad53 mutants either in the presence or absence of DNA damaging agents [ 24 , 32-34 ] , phosphorylation of various CHK2 substrates in vitro or in mammalian cells [ 23 , 26 , 29-31 , 52 , 53 ] , DNA damage responses in cells , and protein stability . ClinVar currently has information for 1 , 418 CHEK2 SNVs , including 98 that are annotated as being pathogenic or likely pathogenic , 1 , 268 that are variants of uncertain
[DISCUSSION] However , residues 515-523 contain a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) that is required for nuclear localization in human cells , and this was confirmed by the ENIGMA study showing that truncations at position 519 ( p. R519X ) or 523 ( p. R523fsX ) , or NLS missense variants p. Arg521Gln and p. Arg521Trp , did not localize to the nucleus in human cells . Given the lack of requirement for the C-terminal 43 amino acids for function in our yeast assay , it is puzzling that 25 of the 249 missense variants in that region were found to be damaging , well beyond the expected false positive rate in our assay . The data also provide additional supporting evidence for the 58 variants that have a ClinVar clinical classification as `` conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity '' , and for 443 missense variants that have been tested in at least one other functional assay . For example , our assay measured the ability of CHK2 variants to promote growth in the absence of Rad53 and DNA damaging agents , while other assays in yeast measured the ability of CHK2 variants to overcome DNA damage in a strain that does not require Rad53 or CHK2 for growth . For some variants , the explanation lies in how different studies report variants and whether the classification systems are based on

Thus , we converted all",,978,97,None,"The checkpoint kinase gene CHEK2 is a key regulator of the immune system and is associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers .

[ABSTRACT] When the transcription of tenA was de-repressed by a spontaneous AT di-nucleotide insertion/deletion in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon , TenA bound to the ribosome maturation factor RimM , and thereby reduced the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX ( known for the activation of natural transformation-associated genes ) . Because spontaneous variations frequently occur during bacterial growth in the number of the AT di-nucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon , this locus acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity . SpxA1 and TenA were found to constitute a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae , primarily based on the observation that overexpressing toxin TenA led to growth arrest in E. coli and enhanced autolysis in S. pneumoniae , and the antitoxin SpxA1 repressed the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon . As manifested by phase switch between opaque and transparent colonies , different genome methylation patterns or epigenomes confer pathogenesis-associated traits , but it is unknown how the pathogen controls the hsdS inversion orientations . Here , we report our finding of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin ( TA ) system that regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions , and thereby bacterial epigenome and associated traits ( e. g. , colony opacity ) by targeting pneumococcal protein synthesis . Human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct intra-populations by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant ( cod ) locus . Attenuation of ComX expression in turn enhanced the transcription of the invertase gene psrA , which favored the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus . Phenotypically , moderate expression of TenA dramatically reshaped pneumococcal epigenome and colony opacity .
[INTRODUCTION] ComX is the alternative sigma factor that , together with ComW , activates the late competence genes for DNA uptake and processing as a part of natural transformation by binding to the `` com box '' sequence in the promoter regions of the target genes . Our recent study has shown that the orientations of hsdS inversions in the cod locus and resulting colony phases are subjective to transcriptional regulation by four two-component regulatory systems ( TCSs ) . Our previous study has shown that ComW , but not the two-component system ComDE , is required for stabilizing the hsdSA1 allelic configuration in the cod locus by an uncharacterized mechanism . Toxins inhibit bacterial growth by targeting essential cellular processes , whereas antitoxins neutralize the activities of cognate toxins at the levels of transcription , translation , activity or stability under steady-state conditions . Pneumococcal phase variation in colony opacity is epigenetically determined by reversible DNA inversions in the three DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the Spn556II/SpnD39III type I restriction-modification ( R-M ) system or the colony opacity determinant ( cod ) locus [ 7-9 ] . As a tyrosine recombinase , PsrA catalyzes extensive DNA inversions between hsdSA and the two silent homologs ( hsdSB and hsdSC ) by recognizing the inverted repeats ( IRs ) flanking the invertible sequences . The cod locus contains the hsdR ( restriction endonuclease ) , hsdM ( DNA methyltransferase ) , psrA or creX ( DNA
[RESULTS] Spontaneous sequence variations of the AT-rich region in the spxA1 promoter region alter the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon and the unbalanced functional relationship between SpxA1 and TenA ; the excess toxin TenA targets the ribosomes by interacting with ribosome biogenesis chaperone RimM to exert its `` toxicity '' , somehow reducing the cellular abundance of ComX ; the reduced ComX leads to the enhanced expression of invertase PsrA and thereby shift the hsdS inversions in the cod locus toward non-hsdSA1 allelic configurations and
[DISCUSSION] While this type of repeat sequence variations is explained by the slipped strand mispairing during DNA replication , recent single-cell RNA sequencing in Klebsiella pneumoniae has revealed that spontaneous expression of certain transposases is responsible for insertion or deletion of repeat sequences in the genome and leads to intra-population heterogeneity in gene expression and phenotype . Since ComX and ComW functionally cooperate to activate the expression of the late competence genes by interacting with RNA polymerase and the conserved `` com box '' sequence , it is possible that the two competence-associated proteins also work together to regulate hsdS inversions by repressing the transcription of psrA . When the operon is controlled by the low-transcription AT variants , SpxA1 neutralizes the toxic effect of TenA by forming a protein complex under the physiological conditions , which would enhance the synthesis of ComX and other hsdS-associated proteins , and the formation of the hsdSA1 allelic configuration and the corresponding methylome . Spx , the SpxA1 homolog in B. subtilis , represses the transcription of many stress response-associated genes by interacting with the α subunit of RNA polymerase and the promoter sequences under physiological conditions [ 47-50 ] , but it is selectively degraded by ATP-dependent protease ClpXP under stress conditions . The TenA-driven allelic loss of hsdSA1 was repeatedly verified
[METHODS] For the measurement of growth curve , E. coli and pneumococci were reinoculated into fresh LB ( with 1 mM IPTG ) or C+Y medium after 1:50 dilution , respectively , and were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours in 48-well flat bottom plates ( Costar , China ) . qPCR mix was carried out with 10 ng genomic DNA",,982,97,None,"Human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct intra-populations by inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant ( cod ) locus .

[ABSTRACT] Contrastive principal component analysis ( cPCA ) has been proposed to address this problem , but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions , with no way of knowing which is correct . High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences , and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition . As a fast , robust , and easy-to-use comparison method , gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena . Finally , we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data , revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data . We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios . Moreover , cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently , making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically . Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA ( gcPCA ) , a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems . However , traditional dimensionality reduction techniques can not accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset . We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement .
[INTRODUCTION] PCA examines the covariance structure of the data to find dimensions that account for more variance than chance ; these constitute patterns that are overrepresented in the data , such as assemblies of neurons whose activity fluctuates up and down together across time in a neural recording [ 6-9 ] , or networks of genes that are up- or down-regulated together across cells in a single-cell RNAseq dataset . We then describe an open source toolbox for Python and MATLAB implementing several versions of gcPCA with different objective functions that are either asymmetric or symmetric , orthogonal or non-orthogonal , or sparse or dense , tailored to suit the specific application at hand . This addresses more subtle and detailed questions , such as which subsets of neurons exhibit increased temporal correlations in condition A than B , or which subsets of genes are more likely to be up- or downregulated together in individual cells in condition A than B . Investigators in the biological sciences are increasingly collecting high-dimensional datasets that are challenging to analyze , with modalities ranging from imaging to electrophysiology to single-cell RNA sequencing . Moreover , cPCA is asymmetric , identifying the most enriched dimensions in the first condition after subtracting out the second condition as background ; it can not treat the two experimental conditions equally . These methods find dimensions that optimally distinguish one dataset from the other , which could correspond to which neurons fire more , or which genes are upregulated , in condition A vs.
[RESULTS] Because the penalty and the sampling error both scale with the variance , this effectively handles the bias toward high-variance dimensions and successfully extracts the ground truth dimensions in our synthetic data , even with finite sampling ( Fig 1E , 1G ) , and even when the range of acceptable α is narrow ( S2 Fig ) . With infinite data , the precise estimates of the eigenspectrum correctly find the dimensions enriched in conditions A and B ( Fig 1C , light line ) , but
[DISCUSSION] One limitation of this study is that we did not establish rigorous criteria for what constitutes `` noisy and finitely-sampled '' data likely to benefit from penalizing high-variance dimensions ( Fig 1 ) , but almost all real-world biological datasets likely qualify to some degree . The biological sciences are currently undergoing an explosion of technologies that produce high-dimensional datasets , including novel forms of microscopy and neuroimaging , high-speed video tracking , Neuropixels recordings , -omics approaches with single-cell resolution , and many others . In most cases using the constraint makes little difference to the end results ( S3A-S3D Fig ) , but the difference will be greater in datasets where some dimensions exhibit much more variance than others , increasing the amount of normalization required . There may also be situations in which cPCA 's α could be a feature , rather than a bug , if the investigator has prior knowledge that the patterns of interest will lie in high- or low-variance dimensions . The key advantage of this approach is not merely that it is computationally cheaper than scanning a range of α 's ; it is that in most real-world cases there is no way to know whether a given choice of α yields a correct solution . In such cases , it would be relatively straightforward to extend gcPCA by adding a

[ABSTRACT] Moreover , the BL-2 network was also suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells lines with aberrant BCR signaling ( HBL-1 , OCI-LY3 ) , indicating that BCR aberration does not cause a major downstream rewiring . The relevance of the crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites . While proximal BCR signaling is well studied , little is known about the crosstalk of downstream effector pathways , and a comprehensive quantitative network analysis of BCR signaling is missing . Here , we semi-quantitatively modelled BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data of BL-2 and BL-41 cells . The models unveiled feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network , including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK . B cell receptor ( BCR ) signaling is required for the survival and maturation of B cells and is deregulated in B cell lymphomas . Compared to the starting network , the trained network for BL-2 cells was better transferable to BL-41 cells .
[INTRODUCTION] We have previously developed an approach termed STeady-STate Analysis of Signaling Networks ( STASNet ) that is based on Modular Response Analysis ( MRA ) and applied this tool to decipher EGFR/RAS signaling in different tumors [ 26 , 39-42 ] as well as to compare mouse embryonic stem cells with different sex chromosome compositions . The main concept of MRA is that the measurable global response matrix R ( e. g. , log fold changes of steady state measurements before and after systematic single node perturbations for every node of the network ) theoretically contains the information to derive the so-called local response r , a matrix whose non-zero entries quantify the edges of the underlying network structure which are called local response coefficients ( see Material and Methods ) . The advantage of the MRA approach is that it allows to model and identify feedback loops that are known to play a crucial role in conferring robustness , shaping the signaling dynamics or integrating multiple converging signals and thus are vital to consider when searching for drug combinations eligible for targeted therapeutics . Reaching a better level of understanding will allow to answer questions such as whether these crosstalks are cell type specific and thus account in part for the differential activity of BCR and its functional outcome , but can also unveil therapeutic opportunities . In STASNet we adapted the MRA theory to real world applications to account for ( 1 ) measurement noise using a maximum likelihood and model selection strategy and ( 2 ) incomplete perturbation and measurement designs by adding a non-identifiability analysis before parameter fitting . In normal physiology the binding of
[DISCUSSION] In conclusion , we could demonstrate that the more generic network trained from BL-2 and BL-41 cell lines had better transfer capacity to DLBCL cell lines HBL-1 and OCILY3 than the literature network indicating that a model trained on BCR-activated B-cells is informative to be transferred to BCR-driven cancer models . Thus , the well-known RAF- > MEK- > ERK-|RAF regulatory loop also exists in BLs and DLBCLs , whereas the negative impact of BCR mediated p38 activation onto this loop is a newly discovered crosstalk found in three BL cell lines BL-2 , BL-41 and CA-46 and one DLBCL cell line HBL-1 . Since in our data instead of an attenuation we observe an upregulation of MEK phosphorylation in cells that show the p38 crosstalk when treated with p38 inhibitor ( Figs 2F , 3A and 5A ) , we postulate that the crosstalk must act on or upstream of MEK . As RAF activity is neither measured nor perturbed , the model coefficients of the p38 crosstalk are only identifiable as combinations with the RAF- > MEK link ( S1 and S2 Tables ) which means a direct crosstalk from p38 to MEK would result in the same fit . In our study , as all cell line models retained a strong negative feedback from ERK to RAF ( Fig 6 ) -which causes an hyperactivation of MEK , when ERK activity is switched off by e. g. , a MEK inhibitor -we would expect a downregulation of MEK
[METHODS] As oftentimes not all nodes can be measured and perturbed , in STASNet we solve the underdetermined situation threefold : ( i ) we only fit entries of R that were measured , ( ii ) we utilize prior knowledge by using a literature-derived starting network ( i. e. , a binary representation of r ) , with which we symbolically fill the entries of r and ( iii",,874,92,None,"B cell receptor signaling is required for the survival and maturation of B cells and is deregulated in B cell lymphoma .

[ABSTRACT] Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling , we provide evidence that two mechanisms could underpin this process : 1 ) DLL4 rather than JAG1 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation ; 2 ) JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex . Operationally , receptor activity is regulated by two principal , counterposed mechanisms : intercellular Notch transactivation triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells ; intracellular cis inhibition mediated by ligands binding to receptors expressed in the same cell . Moreover , different Notch receptor/ligand combinations are known to elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses , and together , these phenomena determine the strength , the duration and the specificity of Notch receptor signalling . To date , it has been assumed that these processes involve discrete ligand homomers and not heteromeric complexes composed of more than one ligand species . We propose a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells , which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis . In this study , we explore the molecular basis of the opposing actions of the Notch ligands , DLL4 and JAG1 , which control angiogenic sprouting . The ubiquitous Notch receptor signalling network is essential for tissue growth and maintenance .
[INTRODUCTION] The overall size , structure and known function of these core receptor/ligand components has remained relatively unchanged over evolutionary time although the number of Notch receptor and ligand family members encoded by different genera varies , for example , invertebrates such as Drosophila possess a single type of Notch receptor controlled by two distinct ligands , whilst vertebrates express up to four distinct receptor paralogues ( Notch1-4 ) and five different ligands : Jagged ( JAG ) 1 , JAG2 , Delta-Like ( DLL ) 1 , DLL3 , and DLL4 . Uniquely amongst cell surface receptors , Notch itself can directly activate gene transcription as part of a DNA-bound activation complex , a signal triggered via a trans interaction between the extracellular domain of the receptor and Notch ligands expressed by neighbouring cells . In this context , recent work has dissected , at the molecular level , the cellular responses to different ligands , which can stimulate either discrete pulses of Notch activity ( in the case of DLL1 ) or a sustained period of signalling ( in the case of DLL4 ) yielding distinct gene expression outcomes . For instance , in the absence of available evidence , is has been generally assumed that cis and trans receptor/ligand interactions are essentially monomeric in nature , and involve binding of one species of ligand and a single species of receptor rather than complexes of different receptor types , or different ligand types . Of significant interest , in this in vivo setting , was the notion that
[RESULTS] A seminal study revealed that JAG1 antagonism of the function of DLL4 determines the balance between tip cells and stalk cells necessary for normal capillary sprouting during mouse retina blood vessel development , although it is not yet clear if this is via direct/indirect means or at which level of Notch signalling JAG1 acts ( receptor transactivation , receptor cis inhibition or both ) . Collectively , our modelling results recapitulate the opposing effects of DLL4 and JAG1 on Notch1 signalling and highlights the importance of a novel mechanism whereby
[DISCUSSION] It is compelling that there are parallels between this ( presumably relatively ancient ) mechanism and a remarkable recent evolutionary innovation which has been proposed to explain , at molecular resolution , the dramatic expansion in size of the cortical region of the human brain , whereby small ligand-like Notch2 receptor paralogues enable Notch receptor activation by directly binding to , and potentially blocking , DLL1-dependent receptor cis inhibition . Currently , it is not fully understood how such a defined pattern of Notch activity is generated and sustained , and a possible contributing factor could be that the relative production rates of Serrate and Delta in the two cell types establishes signalling thresholds , comparable to those observed in adjacent endothelial tip and stalk cells , which enables a heteromeric ligand complex to spatially and temporally restrict Notch receptor activation . Given the wide range of distinct physiological phenomena which are governed by this relatively simple receptor-ligand network ( see [ 1-7 ] ) , multiple additional regulatory mechanisms must operate to enable the broad repertoire of possible responses , including biomechanical forces , post-translational modifications of both receptors and ligands , asymmetric cell divisions and processes which promote and control action-at-a-distance Notch signalling activities . In the context of our new model , by considering these facets of Notch signalling and endothelial sprouting , we could get not only deeper insights into
[METHODS] More generally , if the cis- and trans- binding of Notch ligands and receptors is also assumed to be reversible , the equilibrium of an extended model does not differ substantially from the current , widely accepted , simplified model . ( 11 ) with the first two equations of model ( 1 ) , it can be seen that introducing DLL4-JAG1 heterodimerization reversibility",,951,96,None,"Notch is a ubiquitous receptor that is essential for tissue growth and maintenance .

[ABSTRACT] We first introduce a novel procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different to the one where it was discovered , which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual . We show the value of this procedure by summarising gene expression data from patients with immune-mediated diseases using relevant gene signatures , and clustering these patients using DPMUnc . Firstly , we demonstrate that when data has associated uncertainty , this uncertainty should be used to inform clustering and we present a method which does this , DPMUnc . We present Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty ( DPMUnc ) , an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm which makes use of the uncertainty associated with data points . We cluster immune-mediated diseases ( IMD ) using GWAS summary statistics , which have uncertainty linked with the sample size of the study . Many types of data have associated uncertainty or measurement error , but this is rarely used to inform the clustering . We additionally consider how DPMUnc can be used to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarised using gene signatures . Clustering is widely used in bioinformatics and many other fields , with applications from exploratory analysis to prediction . Secondly , we present a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were originally defined . We find association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc , with clustering structure replicated across the datasets . DPMUnc separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis . We summarise three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD , using three relevant gene signatures . We show that DPMUnc out-performs existing methods on simulated data . The significance of this work is two-fold .

Here , we propose to adapt a standard model for a Bayesian Dirichlet process mixture model to the setting where the data points have associated uncertainty , `` Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty ( DPMUnc ) `` . A variety of methods have been proposed to deal with uncertainty in observations when clustering , including calculating distance between observations accounting for uncertainty , clustering representative objects sampled from the distribution associated with each uncertain observation , and adapting the likelihood by integrating over the distribution associated with each uncertain observation . Examples include data generated by multiple uncertain experts , network clustering where edges have an associated score indicating uncertainty , or the cell type annotation problem in single-cell multiomic data , where different omics layers may assign cells to different clusters . In this work , we focus on quantitative data with associated uncertainty , which may arise for example with random measurement error or the use of summary measures such as the average of three blood pressure readings . In this case , cluster variance would describe the variability of location of the latent observations which can be thought to represent the `` true '' locations of the objects whose location we have observed with
[RESULTS] Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is the only disease to cluster alone , which perhaps reflects that MS is unusual in having both autoinflammatory and autoimmune features , although the PSM does show both neuromyelitis optica ( NMO ) IgG− and systemic JIA have some non-zero probability of clustering with MS. Gene expression signatures have been linked to several immune-mediated diseases , and we identified three such signatures from recent literature : We attempted to cluster patients with a range of IMD in
[DISCUSSION] To then use them on a new dataset with more complex structure , such as a dataset with patients with a mix of immune-mediated diseases , typically requires some form of dimension reduction such as WGCNA or PCA used on the new dataset , either using just those genes from the signature or using all genes with the hope that one WGCNA module or variable in PCA will coincide with the signature . On a range of simulated datasets , DPMUnc out-performed existing methods and the posterior similarity values were shown to be relatively well calibrated , so that if two points have posterior similarity of p , this roughly translates to probability p that they are in the same cluster in the true clustering . Our proposed method of summarising a gene expression across a signature extends the possible uses of signatures , and since the signature may be weaker on a dataset with more complex structure , it may be crucial to take the variability of the signature into account , which DPMUnc allows . We illustrated with simulated data how the cluster mean inferred by DPMUnc is closer to the points that have lower uncertainty , whereas methods like mclust and k-means place the cluster mean close to the empirical mean of all the
[METHODS] To avoid near duplicates , we retained only one set of results from UK Biobank ( UKBB ) by excluding the GeneAtlas analysis , and retaining the Neale analyses which had a greater representation of rarer immune traits , leaving us with 45 traits in our final dataset . Simulated data provides access to the true latent observations and",,1000,98,None,"Clustering is widely used in bioinformatics and many other fields , with applications from exploratory analysis to prediction . Many types of data have associated uncertainty or measurement error , but this is rarely used to inform the clustering . We present Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty ( DPMUnc ) , an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm which makes use of the uncertainty associated with data points . In this work , we present a method for generating a summary of 3 gene signatures on a dataset different to the one where it was discovered , which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual . DPMunc separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis . The significance of this work is two-fold ."

[ABSTRACT] By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations , we show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features , whereas others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards the other features . This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser , more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision . Whereas humans base their judgements of category membership to a large extent on shape , deep networks rely much more strongly on other features such as color and texture . We show that the bias can be explained by the interactions between the weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent . We design simple , artificial image datasets in which shape , color , and texture features can be used to predict the image class . One crucial problem is that they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision . Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful as models of the primate visual system . While this problem has been widely documented , the underlying reasons remain unclear .
[INTRODUCTION] Indeed , several lines of evidence indicate that deep networks process images very differently from humans : they are susceptible to adversarial attacks , less robust to image corruptions , and do not show evidence of perceptual grouping phenomena that play key roles in human perception . In addition , deep neural networks were once inspired by and take their name from the biological neural networks studied by neuroscientists and therefore retain some similarity to the brain : they are made up from simple computational units that are connected in complex ways . Second , we show that some of these networks fail to learn the classification at all when they are trained from scratch on a dataset where shape is the only available feature , indicating that there is an architectural deficiency ( hypothesis 2 ) . This approach has been remarkably successful , especially in modeling visual processing , where deep networks have been used to predict cortical representations with high accuracy [ 8-10 ] and even to generate artificial stimuli to control responses in target neurons . Deep neural networks can now be trained to perform tasks like image classification or language generation at a higher level than any other model class and , in sufficiently narrow settings , they can even outperform humans . While deep networks share some similarities with visual cortex , the latter makes use of many structural design principles that have not yet been adopted in deep networks , such as feedback connections or lateral grouping . Therefore , deep networks can express both mid-level
[RESULTS] We then evaluated the performance of each network on several test sets ( see Methods ) : a shape-only version of the dataset in which the color or texture feature was absent ( e. g. , grey rectangles instead of colorful ones ) , a color- or texture-only version in which the shape feature was absent ( e. g. , colorful squares ) , and a conflict version in which the assignment of colors or textures to classes was inverted . So far , we have shown that convolutional networks are
[DISCUSSION] Furthermore , by using the neural tangent kernel as an analytical tool we identified a mechanism by which the learning dynamics of mini-batch gradient descent can bias a network towards color and texture : there are groups of images for which gradients that increase the sensitivity to these features are aligned , whereas there are no such image groups for shape features . Competition is an especially promising candidate for incorporation into deep networks for several reasons : its cortical equivalent-normalization-is well documented and pervasive and there are theories about the computational role it could play in vision by sparsifying and whitening representations . While each of these problems can be solved , for example by designing custom architectures or training on augmented datasets , understanding how these differences to human vision arise from the learning dynamics of deep networks may point the way to unified solutions . This explanation illustrates why training on stylized images , using appearance-changing image augmentation , and avoiding very small random crops can help increase the shape bias of deep networks , but still fails to make them sensitive to global shape features . The question is whether there is a qualitative difference between how transformers process natural images and our artificial stimuli ( interpretation 1 ) , or whether transformers have an underlying deficiency preventing them from learning certain shape features , but natural images contain enough other features to
[METHODS] We evaluated network performance on our artificial image datasets to answer two types of questions : ( 1 ) can a given network learn to use a specific feature to classify images ( learnability ) and ( 2 ) if a network is faced with two equally predictive features during learning , which one does it rely on ( bias ) . We then test",,940,95,None,"Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful as models of the primate visual system .

[ABSTRACT] HSCs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and that interact with ( TGFβ1 ) molecules which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen , the main component of the ECM . By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis , we confirmed this accumulation , identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression . Furthermore , we demonstrated the model 's sensitivity to ( TGFβ1 ) parameters , suggesting its adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions for which levels of ( TGFβ1 ) production associated with the inflammatory response differ . Few models of hepatic fibrosis have been proposed , and none of them include the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing analyses . Overall , our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis . Hepatic stellate cells ( HSC ) are the source of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis , a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases . While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps , reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs ( iHSCs ) are required to sustain fibrosis . Using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis , we validated the predicted ECM dynamics . Moreover , our model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues . We used the Kappa graph rewriting language , for which we used tokens and counters to overcome temporal explosion . Here , we developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion . Simulation studies revealed the critical role of the HSC inactivation process during fibrosis progression and reversion . Understanding the dynamics of HSCs will provide insights needed to develop new therapeutic approaches . Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease .
[INTRODUCTION] The Dutta-Moscato model has also been extended and modified by Wand and Jiang to include information about lipid accumulation induced by CCl4 treatment , making it possible to study the progression of liver fibrosis in presence or absence of steatosis . In addition to these agent-based models , Friedman and Hao recently published a partial differential equation ( PDE ) model for liver fibrosis that includes information on inflammation regulation and ECM remodeling , enabling exploration of anti-fibrotic drugs . Using the Kappa language , our model describes the interactions between all cell populations and molecules such as transforming growth factor β 1 ( TGFβ1 ) which induces HSC activation and promotes secretion of type I collagen , the major component of ECM . Although instructive , all these models reduce the dynamics of HSCs to their activation to become ECM-producing myofibroblasts , without taking into account the plasticity of HSCs recently illustrated by large-scale single-cell analyses . Because fibrosis is a pathological tissue repair activity that occurs in different organs , unified approaches have been proposed by including common components such as the inflammatory response and extracellular matrix remodeling . By analyzing RNA sequencing data from 102 patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis , we confirmed this accumulation , identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression . The multi-state combinatorial nature of the cells studied led us to choose a rule-based model ( RBM ) approach , much more appropriate for dealing
[RESULTS] In these Kappa models , the hepatic stellate cells are the agents which are characterized by three sites ( Fig 1C ) which are : i ) the cell_state of HSCs ( qHSC , aHSC , MFB , iHSC , react_HSC , react_MFB , apop_sene_MFB ) , ii ) the TGFB1_binding that can be free or bound and iii ) the state of the TGFβ1 receptor ( TGFBR ) that can be localized at the membrane , internalized or degraded . This induction of collagen 1
[DISCUSSION] First we have demonstrated the applicability of the Kappa language to multi-scale approaches by using : tokens , to represent the quantities of molecules in a compact way , and counters to abstract the dynamics of cell-specific phenotypes . These predictions have been validated either experimentally in a mouse model of CCl4-induced fibrosis , or using RNA sequencing data from patients with fibrosis . Thus , our model provides biological predictions for the reactivation loop , the dynamics of inactivated cells and their accumulation during fibrosis progression . Second , we developed the first model of HSC dynamics during liver fibrosis and reversion . The present study provides two major findings .
[METHODS] Using Kappa rules , we described HSC dynamics by including various biological processes such as the activation of quiescent HSCs ( qHSC ) by TGFβ1 leading to activated HSCs ( aHSC ) , the transdifferentiation of aHSCs into Myofribroblasts ( MFB ) , the elimination of MFBs after removal of TGFβ1 either by apoptosis and senescence pathways ( apop_sene_MFBs ) or",,934,95,None,"Hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) are the source of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis , a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases .

[ABSTRACT] Whereas the proposed meta-analysis can uniquely evaluate and account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to , for example , varying genomic profiling platforms , our extensive simulations showed that the developed method was more computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to analysis of the pooled individual-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity . Leveraging the recent established asymptotic standard error of the R-squared ( R2 ) -based mediation effect estimation for high-dimensional omics mediators , we have developed a novel meta-analysis framework requiring only summary statistics and allowing inter-study heterogeneity . Large-scale genomic consortia , such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) program , comprise multiple cohorts with diverse technologies to elucidate the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits and diseases . We applied the developed method to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol . Meta-analysis is used to aggregate the effects of interest across multiple studies , while its methodology is largely underexplored in mediation analysis , particularly in estimating the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators . The proposed method is available in R package MetaR2M on GitHub .
[INTRODUCTION] For instance , in our motivating example , the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute 's ( NHLBI ) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) project brings together over 85 cohorts consisting of more than 180 , 000 participants using various high-throughput profiling technologies to elucidate the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits . Applying this innovative framework , we conducted a meta-analysis across various cohorts from the TOPMed Framingham Heart Study ( FHS ) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure ( BP ) and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol . To address this unmet need in the emergence of large-scale genomic profiling , we introduce a novel meta-analysis framework , allowing for both fixed-effects and random-effects , to estimate the total mediation effect in high-dimensional settings . A recently developed two-stage cross-fitted interval estimation procedure for R M e d 2 enables the implementation of meta-analysis in mediation analysis due to its availability of asymptotic standard error and computational efficiency , as to be pursued here . High-dimensional mediation analysis is a crucial analytical approach focused on evaluating the mediating role of molecular phenotypes , such as gene expression , in the relationship between environmental exposure/risk factor and health outcomes [ 7-12 ] . This framework requires only summary statistics and allows between-study heterogeneity arising from factors such as differences in high-throughput technologies ( microarray vs. RNA-sequencing ) and diverse ethnicity . Within this domain , the inverse variance weighting method is widely adopted ,
[DISCUSSION] In the TOPMed program , as a proof of concept we applied our proposed new meta-analysis framework across various FHS and MESA cohorts to assess the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic BP and sex-related variation in HDL-C. Our findings closely align with results derived from the original individual-level data with much less computational cost , highlighting the efficiency of our method in handling the computational burden caused by large-scale studies . Furthermore , in the more realistic scenario where the assumption of a common effect size across all studies no longer holds , the random-effects model maintains an acceptable coverage probability when the number of studies is relatively large , for example , larger than 10 , which holds for most large-scale genomic consortia , such as the TOPMed program with over 85 studies and The Global Lipids Genetics Consortium with over 200 studies . On the other hand , as shown in our real data applications ( Fig 3 ) , the total mediation effects captured by the R M e d 2 measure were more consistent across cohorts despite different sets of genes were selected in each cohort , highlighting the consistent biological mechanisms revealed at the transcriptomic and biological pathway levels , but not necessarily at the individual gene level . Meta-analysis can be an appealing alternative to analysis of the entire dataset at once in terms of computational feasibility and evaluating potential heterogeneity across risk factors for
[METHODS] Without loss of generality , we assume that all variables have been centered at 0 and scaled to have variance of 1 ; in addition , all measured potential confounders have been regressed out from X , Mj 's and Y from the following equations , which constitute the mediation model : Y = c X + ε 1 , M j = α j X + ξ",,879,92,None,"High-dimensional mediation analysis is a critical analytical approach focused on evaluating the mediating role of molecular phenotypes , such as gene expression , in the relationship between environmental exposure/risk factor and health outcomes .

[ABSTRACT] Here , we propose a novel method ( PDRWH ) , which aims to prioritize the mutated genes of a single patient based on their impact on the abnormal expression of downstream genes across a group of patients who share the co-mutation genes and similar gene expression profiles . Although many computational methods have been developed with this purpose , the majority of existing methods solely provided a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients , ignoring the high heterogeneity of driver events across patients . Cancer development is driven by an accumulation of a small number of driver genetic mutations that confer the selective growth advantage to the cell , while most passenger mutations do not contribute to tumor progression . We also validated one of our predicted novel personalized driver genes on tumor cell proliferation by vitro cell-based assays , the promoting effect of the high expression of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 ( LRP1 ) on tumor cell proliferation . The wide experimental results on 16 cancer datasets from TCGA showed that PDRWH excels in identifying known general driver genes and tumor-specific drivers . The personalized driver profiles could improve tumor stratification , providing new insights into understanding tumor heterogeneity and taking a further step toward personalized treatment . The identification of these driver genes responsible for tumorigenesis is a crucial step in designing effective cancer treatments . In the comparative testing across five cancer types , PDRWH outperformed existing individual-level methods as well as cohort-level methods . Our results also demonstrated that PDRWH could identify both common and rare drivers . It remains challenging to identify the personalized driver genes .
[INTRODUCTION] With recent advances in genomics technologies , comprehensive platforms such as the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) , have led to the characterization of the molecular signatures of human cancers spanning 33 cancer types , providing an unprecedented opportunity to develop computational methods for driver gene identification . In this study , we present a novel method named PDRWH ( Prioritizing Personalized Cancer Driver Genes via Random Walks on a Hypergraph ) , inspired by the effectiveness of hypergraphs in modeling biology networks , data structures , and other systems [ 24-27 ] . Evaluated across datasets from 16 cancer types in TCGA and benchmarked against existing driver gene prediction methods using five cancer type datasets , PDRWH consistently demonstrates superior performance in identifying both known general driver genes and tumor-specific driver genes . Despite achieving promising results , these personalized driver prioritization methods take into account the data available from a single sample to produce a ranking of drivers for every specific patient , neglecting the availability of data from other samples . Unlike methods that rely on data from a specific sample , PDRWH integrates data from a cohort to generate personalized driver gene predictions , enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the collective information across multiple samples . Under the assumption that the impact of a potential driver gene can be determined by its effect on the genes regulated by it , PDRWH ranks potential driver genes based on the influence of mutated genes
[RESULTS] To achieve this , we randomly selected some patients from the five cancer types , breast invasive carcinoma ( BRCA ) , kidney renal clear cell carcinoma ( KIRC ) , liver cancer ( LIHC ) , glioblastoma ( GBM ) , and stomach adenocarcinoma ( STAD ) , and created personalized gene interaction subnetworks for each patient by mapping the mutated genes and abnormally expressed genes onto STRINGv10 . Across the five cancer types , the potential driver gene TTN with high mutation frequency is
[DISCUSSION] Additionally , our current model primarily focuses on point mutations , including single-nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) and short insertions or deletions ( indels ) , due to their prevalence , ease of detection , and potential as genetic markers for specific phenotypes that promote tumor formation . PDRWH , similar to many unsupervised algorithms , can directly uncover hidden patterns and structures in data without the need for explicit model training or a large number of labeled genes , aiming to provide comprehensive support for the analysis of driver genes . Despite these limitations , PDRWH has demonstrated reliable performance in inferring personalized driver genes , which is promising for discovering potential causal genetic variants that would be obscured by tumor heterogeneity . By grouping patient-specific mutated genes and abnormally expressed genes within the corresponding hyperedge , the hypergraph model allows for a comprehensive representation of association among genes across multiple samples simultaneously , rather than separately . The random walk algorithm on the hypergraph is tailored to generate a quantitative assessment of the influence on the gene interaction network within the target sample and its neighboring samples , facilitating the systematic prioritization of candidate personalized driver genes . We believe our method will complement existing driver identification methods and will help us discover potential personalized drivers , especially those rare drivers
[METHODS] Given the current state v→t : Thus , transition probabilities from vertex u to vertex v are calculated as follows : p ( u , v ) =∑e∈Eh ( u , e ) we∑e^∈Eh ( u , e^ ) we^w ( v , e ) ∑v^∈Vw ( v^ , e ) ( 8 ) which can be written in an alternative",,963,97,None,"The identification of the driver genes responsible for tumorigenesis is a crucial step in designing effective cancer treatments .

Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic data , our proposal successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models , demonstrating better scalability and superior performance against other parallel solvers . Additionally , we added a scalable uncertainty quantification phase after model calibration , and used it to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems . These results were further enhanced using a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning , with significant gains in terms of both accuracy and computational cost . Overall , this study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy , thereby to inform the clinical decision-making process . The Virtual Epileptic Patient ( VEP ) refers to a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities . The approach utilizes SaCeSS , a cooperative metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation , to yield high-quality solutions without requiring excessive computational time . This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach .
[INTRODUCTION] Global search optimization methods offer several advantages , such as an scalability and flexibility in objective functions and constraints , enhanced exploration-exploitation trade-off , robustness to initial conditions , and the capability to deal with non-convex and multimodal problems . Although clinical information or knowledge extracted from multimodal data integrated into the prior can significantly enhance the accuracy of EZ/PZ estimation , the use of global optimization methods becomes crucial in scenarios where such prior knowledge is lacking . By leveraging the advantages of global search optimization methods with high-performance computing ( HPC ) infrastructures , we can achieve faster and more accurate parameter estimation , thereby enhancing the overall efficacy of our approach . By accurately capturing diverse seizure dynamics and generating computer simulations resembling intracranial EEG recordings , this technique offers a versatile platform to optimize the surgical strategy and to aid in clinical decision-making . Virtual Epileptic Patient ( VEP ; ) is a digital modeling approach that integrates mathematical modeling of abnormal neural activity with patient-specific anatomical data to predict the brain network involved in seizure generation and propagation in individuals . Nevertheless , the success of surgical interventions for drug-resistant patients critically depends on the precision and reliability of the initial hypotheses , e. g. , the spatial map of EZ/PZ as an identification of the seizure organization [ 5 , 10-15 ] . Optimizing parameters efficiently is therefore essential for gaining insights into underlying mechanisms of the data-generating process in pathological conditions , such as the dynamics and connectivity of abnormal brain networks . However
[RESULTS] The detailed results of this analysis are shown in Table 3 , where , in general , all SaCeSS configurations achieved fitness functions close to zero , except for problems 5 and 6 , where the RMSE metric is unable to capture the noisy nature of the observation at the sensor level . This result indicates that while SaCeSS can effectively handle the very fast-changing components in the VEP model , accurately estimating the EZ/PZ from noisy signals can be challenging when using an error function such as RMSE for
[DISCUSSION] Therefore , several open questions remain for future consideration , including the calibration of stochastic problems given their high computational cost , and enhancing this procedure through a sensitivity analysis to determine the most impactful settings for inclusion or exclusion during fine-tuning . Thus , in order to enhance efficiency when addressing stochastic models , a promising strategy could be to study the integration of SaCeSS with Bayesian optimization methods , known for their proficiency in such challenges , at least for problems of moderate number of parameters . In the comparison of SaCeSS with two other leading parallel solvers ( asynPDE and PS-CMA-ES ) , as showcased in Table 2 , our approach demonstrates a consistent advantage over these competitors across multiple criteria in addressing VEP problems . The accurate parameter estimations in different configurations of the VEP model , as shown in Table 2 and Figs 2 , 3 and 4 highlight the capability of SaCeSS to solve high-dimensional problems within a reasonable computational time , using just 12 processors . In summary , driven by the challenge of estimating parameters in a series of progressively complex whole-brain network models related to epilepsy , this study started with the objective of selecting a resilient and efficient global optimization solver . Nevertheless , SaCeSS also delivers steadfast performance on smaller-scale systems , such as desktop workstations equipped with a moderate quantity of cores and

[ABSTRACT] Mathematical modeling suggested that such a non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells can be explained if the lung Mtb population consists of several ( at least 2 ) sub-populations with different replication/death kinetics : one major population expanding early and being controlled/eliminated , while another , a smaller population expanding at later times causing a counterintuitive increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells . Interestingly , the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in lungs of Mtb-infected rabbits did not follow an expected monotonic decline ; the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points . It is well understood that pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung but quantitative estimates of rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of patients or animals such as monkeys or rabbits remain largely unknown . Taken together , our new data and mathematical modeling-based analyses illustrate differences in Mtb dynamics in mice and rabbits confirming a perhaps somewhat obvious observation that `` rabbits are not mice '' . In our in vitro experiments we found that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 strain than in a more commonly used laboratory-adapted Mtb strain H37Rv ( the segregation coefficient being s = 0 . We performed experiments with rabbits infected with a novel , virulent clinical Mtb isolate of the Beijing lineage , HN878 , carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10 . Our model predictions can be tested in future experiments in which HN878-pBP10 dynamics in individual granulomas is followed over time . Given that in rabbits HN878 strain forms well circumscribed granulomas , our results suggest independent bacterial dynamics in subsets of such granulomas . Importantly , a model with one kinetically homogeneous Mtb population could not explain the data including when the model was run stochastically . Tuberculosis ( TB ) , the disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) , remains a major health problem with 10 . 6 million cases of the disease and 1 . 6 million deaths in 2021 . 10 in HN878 vs. s = 0 . 18 in H37Rv ) .
[INTRODUCTION] Stochastic simulations of Mtb dynamics suggest that it is possible to use replication clock plasmid ( and HN878-pBP10 specifically ) to estimate the rates of Mtb turnover in individual lesions in lungs of rabbits , paving the way to rigorously understand why individual granulomas in a given animal vary dramatically in the number of viable bacteria . Because isoniazid is effective only against actively replicating bacteria , success of isoniazid-based treatment suggests that during Mtb infection bacteria are not dormant but do replicate , and apparent constancy of bacterial numbers in latency/chronic infection is due to a delicate balance between Mtb replication and death rates . Studies in B6 mice , infected via aerosol with a conventional dose of Mtb ( about 100 colony-forming units , CFU ) , have shown that bacterial numbers in the lung increase during acute phase of infection but become almost static during the chronic phase of infection [ 14-17 ] . Interestingly , the percent of plasmid-bearing cells did not decline monotonically as has been previously observed with H37Rv-pPB10 strain in B6 mice , and our previous mathematical model failed to accurately fit the observed data on Mtb CFU in the lung . Furthermore , in the same animal some lesions may heal and some may become more active ( determined , for example , by using PET/CT technology , ) but the
[RESULTS] By constraining many of the rates to be same between different time periods ( e. g. , as we have done previously ) as well as by assuming the same initial numbers of cells in different subpopulations we could find sets of parameters that fitted the data better than all our previous models but with a relatively small number of parameters ( e. g. , in S4 Fig we used 13 parameters ) . To investigate whether typical sampling
[DISCUSSION] How the dynamics would proceed at lower doses is uncertain although we made model-driven predictions on how parameters of Mtb replication rate and death may influence the size and composition of Mtb replicating in individual granulomas of rabbits ( or other animal species ) starting with a single plasmid-bearing cell . Simulating Mtb dynamics stochastically assuming one-population model in which individual bacteria become activated at different times after infection did not allow to accurately match experimental data ( S5 Fig ) suggesting that stochastic dynamics of one population model can not explain non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells in rabbit lungs . Here we extend these studies by showing that even when measuring Mtb numbers in the whole lung of rabbits , along with the percent of bacterial cells carrying plasmid pPB10 , we can detect and to a degree quantify heterogeneity in rates of Mtb replication and death in vivo . Of course , it is likely that the number of different sub-populations could be even larger that two or three , e. g. , if individual bacteria seeding different lung tissues have somewhat independent dynamics as has been proposed for Mtb dynamics in non-human primates . Stochastic simulations also suggested that measuring

[ABSTRACT] In this work , we developed a glycan-modeling algorithm , GlycanTreeModeler , that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer , using adaptive kernel density estimates ( KDE ) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) and from quantum mechanics ( QM ) calculations . We employed these tools to design de novo glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition , and experimentally verified shielding . Structures predicted by GlycanTreeModeler agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both de novo modeling and experimental density-guided building . This work will inform glycoprotein model prediction , glycan masking , and further aid computational methods in experimental structure determination and refinement . GlycanTreeModeler was benchmarked on a test set of glycan structures of varying lengths , or `` trees '' . Computational approaches can aid in carbohydrate structure prediction , structure determination , and design . However , experimental structure determination of sugar polymers is notoriously difficult . Carbohydrates and glycoproteins modulate key biological functions .
[INTRODUCTION] Computational glycobiology tools and webapps have been developed for protein glycosylations , validation of carbohydrate structural chemistry , statistical analysis , and docking , Common methods in glycoprotein modeling typically involve molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations or adding glycans by manual placement and conformational tweaking into their density for structure determination . We rigorously benchmark the new method on a set of diverse high-resolution crystal structures of glycans in symmetric crystal environments using the new analysis framework SimpleMetrics and a new application called rosetta_scripts_jd3 , and we show that the GlycanTreeModeler is capable of recapitulating native glycan structures with high accuracy both through de novo and density-guided modeling . Through the plethora of high-resolution crystallographic and cryo-EM studies , we also know that glycans can adopt stable conformations with well-defined density observed for many of the glycan residues in each tree , especially towards the root of the glycan tree , even for some unrestrained glycans , . We expand on this foundational work through the addition of new carbohydrate-specific sampling methods , an updated conformer database employing adaptive kernel density estimates , a new framework for general analysis in Rosetta ( SimpleMetrics ) , and a new algorithm for accurately modeling complex carbohydrates , the GlycanTreeModeler . Viral glycoproteins such as HIV envelope trimer , influenza hemagglutinin , and SARS-CoV-2 spike , employ N-linked glycosylation as an immune evasion strategy , taking advantage of the fact that host glycans on the surface of proteins are usually recognized as `` self '' by the adaptive immune system . Initiation of this process occurs during translation , by
[RESULTS] Given the predictive capability of the GlycanTreeModeler to model the spatial arrangement of complex glycans , we used the algorithm in combination with RosettaScript SugarCoating methods for sequon design and computational glycosylation to iteratively design four N-linked glycans onto the outer surface of the I53-50A trimeric component of the I53-50 protein nanoparticle scaffold ( Fig 5A ; details of the design approach are described in Materials and Methods in S1 Text . In the benchmark set , the internal ( superimposed ) RMSDs are generally low in comparison to the overall RMSD (
[DISCUSSION] In fact , even before full optimization and release , the GlycanSampler algorithm ( previously the glycan_relax app ) was used to model glycans on HIV , Hepatitis C , vaccine candidates , and ( with the final optimized version ) SARS-CoV-2 , illustrating the general utility of the algorithm and its potential to inform chemical biology . The tools presented here can sample and build multiple potential whole glycans at a site through the SimpleGlycosylateMover , but core Rosetta methods that also consider species and cell-type dependent glycan chemistries during the GlycanTreeModeler or end-to-end deep learning methods would be a welcome addition to the methods presented here . Knowledge of the range of glycoforms and occupancy occurring at a glycosylation site can be obtained through mass-spectroscopy techniques , but due to chemical and structural heterogeneity at any single glycan site , modelers will typically need to build models for multiple different glycoforms at a single site , especially for complex glycans . In addition , we demonstrated the usability of these methods through glycan masking the trimeric subunit of a two-component self-assembling protein nanoparticle that is used as a scaffold to multi-valency display viral glycoprotein antigens . However , even with this consideration , many of the benchmark glycans that were modeled accurately to their crystal structures are not hindered by monomer or crystal contacts , but have few interactions to protein residues in their glycan root . However ,

[ABSTRACT] Under glucose signal , PoFbx23 absence ( Δfbx23 ) results in decreased transcription levels of the brlA gene which encodes the master regulator for asexual development and six spore pigmentation genes ( abrB→abrA→aygB→arpA→arpB→albA ) which encode the proteins in the dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin pathway , along with impaired conidiation . Penicillium oxalicum contains many transcription factors , such as BrlA , CreA , XlnR , and Ace1 , conserved in filamentous fungi that regulate the fungal development and transcription of ( hemi ) cellulase genes . Accumulated PoAce1 protein is a dysfunctional form that no longer binds promoters of the target gene , including the cellulase genes cbh1 and eg1 , the hemicellulase gene xyn11A , and the pigmentation-related gene abrB . PoFbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator , recognizing and activating PoAce1 , allowing the latter to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects ( activating or repressing ) under different signals . A small portion of PoFbx23 associates with Skp1 to form PoFbx23-Skp1 heterodimer or assembles with the three invariable core components ( Skp1 , Cul1 , and Rbx1 ) of SCF to form the SCFFbx23 complex . Transcription factor Ace1 ( also known as SltA ) positively correlated with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively correlated with the expression of ( hemi ) cellulase genes . Deleting the Pofbx23 gene does not affect Poace1 gene transcription but results in the remarkable accumulation of all versions of the PoAce1 protein . The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF ( Skp1-Cullin-F-box ) complex directly recognizes the target substrate via interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate . When PoFbx23 is present , PoAce1 exists as a full-length version and several low-molecular-weight degraded versions . Under cellulose signal , transcription levels of ( hemi ) cellulase genes in the Δfbx23 mutant are significantly upregulated . The limited number of identified ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitination field . Protein ubiquitination is usually coupled with proteasomal degradation and is crucial in regulating protein quality . Most of PoFbx23 is present in free form within the nucleus . A ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair , SCFFbx23-Ace1 , is identified in P. oxalicum . F-box protein is the determinant of substrate specificity . PoAce1 has polyubiquitin modification .
[INTRODUCTION] The SCF complex is composed of three invariable core components , namely the scaffolding protein Cullin 1 ( CUL1 ) , a RING-finger protein ( RBX1 ) that recruits the E2 , and the S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 ( SKP1 ) , an adaptor that bridges the core SCF complex with a variable F-box protein ( FBP ) and its corresponding protein target . The Cys2His2 ( C2H2 ) -type transcription factor Ace1/SltA conserved in various filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus , Penicillium , Trichoderma , Neurospora , Magnaporthe , Fusarium , and Beauveria , plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of target genes . It contains many transcription factors such as BrlA , which regulates fungal asexual development , CreA , XlnR , and Ace1 , which regulate ( hemi ) cellulase gene transcription , conserved in various fungi such as Aspergillus , Trichoderma , and Neurospora . Fungal growth , development , secondary metabolism , and extracellular enzyme secretion are strongly related to changes in the transcription levels of related genes , in which sequence-specific transcription factors play a crucial regulatory role . Classically , these E3s are classified into four protein families : RING ( Really Interesting New Gene ) , HECT ( homologous to E6AP C-terminus ) , U-box , and PHD-finger ( Plant Homeo Domain ) . Protein ubiquitination is usually
[RESULTS] As previous studies have shown that substrate adaptors do not always associate with Cul1-Rbx1 heterodimers ; assembly of F-box proteins into SCF complexes ranges from 0-70 % ( median of ~19 % ) , we speculate that the majority of PoFbx23 binds PoAce1 by forming a heterodimer PoFbx23-Skp1 ( Fig 1E , left ) , while a small portion of PoFbx23 assembles with the other three components to form the SCFFbx23 complex . As substrate proteins are linked to
[DISCUSSION] Given the direct evidence from our study that PoAce1 is a substrate for PoFbx23 and the results of that A. nidulans AnAce1 was discovered in the 23 proteins which were pulled down as potential interacting proteins with AnFbx23 , it is reasonable to conclude that Fbx23-Ace1 pair is conserved in Penicillium sp . Upon discovering that the ~32-kDa form of PoAce1 was also present in the Ace1-TAP eluate ( Figs 1C , 4A , and 5A , green arrow ) , our initial hypothesis was that SCFFbx23-Ace1 took the proteasome-dependent pathway : PoAce1 was degraded by SCFFbx23-mediated UPS and took the ~32-kDa active form that regulates the transcription of the target genes ; the 32-kDa form would vanish if Pofbx23 gene is deleted . However , PoFbx23 's absence only resulted in a significant increase in PoAce1 protein abundance relative to normal cells ; no discernible difference in PoAce1 protein degradation was observed : every signal of PoAce1 protein , including the full-length ( signal at ~ 100 kDa ) or degraded versions ( signals at low Mw . By integrating the discoveries from this study with the wealth of knowledge from previous research on the Fbx23 protein and the transcription factor SltA/Ace1 in P. oxalicum
[METHODS] For yeast two-hybrid assay ( Y2H ) analysis , the coding sequence ( CDS ) of two truncated PoAce1 , Ace1- ( 1 to 396 aa ) and Ace1- ( 484 to 816 aa ) which avoid DNA binding domain of PoAce1 , were amplified by primers A396-ADF/A396-ADR and A816-ADF/A816-ADR , respectively . 1 mg input",,1015,99,None,"In the fungus Penicillium oxalicum , the ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF ( Skp1-Cullin-F-box ) complex directly recognizes the target substrate via interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate .

[ABSTRACT] Altogether , these results highlight important mechanistic aspects of BM protein secretion and illustrate how BM diversity can emerge from the spatial control of distinct traffic routes . We also found that the dystrophin-associated protein complex ( DAPC ) and Rab10 were both present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins .

However , the traffic routes associated with BM formation and the mechanistic modulations explaining its diversification are still poorly understood .

The basement membrane ( BM ) is an essential structural element of tissues , and its diversification participates in organ morphogenesis . Here , we determined the specific molecular identity and cell exit sites of BM protein secretory routes . Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium relies on a BM composed of oriented BM fibrils and a more homogenous matrix . First , we found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM protein secretion . DAPC was essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route . First , the Exo70 subunit directly interacted with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization . Moreover , we identified a dual function for the exocyst complex in this context . Second , the exocyst complex was also required for the Rab8 route .
[INTRODUCTION] BM fibrils are generated from newly synthetized BM proteins that accumulate in the lateral pericellular spaces between follicular cells before being inserted in the BM into an oriented manner by the directed egg chamber rotation . However , it has been suggested that BM fibrils act as a cue for actin fiber orientation at the basal domain of follicle cells that would be the main mechanical effector of elongation . Loss of function of the small GTPases Rab10 and Rab8 , or of their respective guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEF ; Crag and Stratum ) leads to the mistargeting of a fraction of BM proteins towards the apical domain . Our understanding of BM biology has been broadened by studies in invertebrates that revealed , using fluorescent tagged versions of BM components , the unexpected diversity of BM structures and dynamics . Basement membrane ( BM ) is a specialized extracellular matrix forming a complex sheet-like architectural meshwork that lines most of animal tissues , such as epithelium and muscle . BM protein secretion may involve specific proteins , mainly because of the large size of the protein complexes ( e. g. procollagen ) that must transit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface . Elongation relies on the establishment of planar cell polarity that is compulsory to launch a process of oriented collective cell migration , perpendicularly to the AP axis , from stage 1 to stage 8 of oogenesis . It was initially proposed that BM fibrils serve
[RESULTS] First , we verified that the expression of the UAS : Col IV-GFP transgene in the whole tissue using the follicle cell-specific driver tj : Gal4 led to the formation of a fluorescent BM , like the one observed with endogenous Col IV-GFP , indicating that the transgene was normally incorporated in the different BM types ( S2 Fig ) . In agreement with this hypothesis , the double Rab8-Rab10 KD completely impaired basal secretion and almost all the Col IV-GFP signal was at the apical surface
[DISCUSSION] The fact that Rab8 and Rab10 share a similar function ( BM protein secretion ) , but with a different output ( homogenous vs fibrillar BM ) , in a highly tractable system for genetics and imaging , offers a unique opportunity to thoroughly investigate their molecular and mechanistic specificities . On the basis of the present results , we propose the co-existence of parallel secretory routes orchestrated by these Rab proteins with different cell exit sites defined by cell polarity axes as the basic mechanism to explain BM diversification during development . Our work brings new mechanistic insights into how BM proteins are secreted in epithelial cells and demonstrates that BM diversification during development can arise from the existence of different secretory routes with different cell exit sites . The same three Rab GTPases have been jointly involved in different processes such as ciliogenesis , targeted exocytosis or lysosome homeostasis where they have been proposed to act in a redundant manner [ 43-47 ] . Interestingly , the extracellular matrix is different between the myotendinous junction and the interjunctional sarcolemmal basement membrane and may provide another developmental context where several routes targeted to different subcellular domains may be implicated . Their concomitant loss of function phenocopies , to some extent , the double Rab8-Rab10 KD , suggesting that both routes of BM protein basolateral secretion are

[ABSTRACT] Specifically , we demonstrate empirically that MTL can mitigate bias from underrepresented subtypes , and that MTL allows the model to learn patterns of co-resistance to combinations of antibodies , thus providing tools to predict antibodies ' epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations . Recently , machine learning models trained using resistance outcomes for multiple antibodies at once , a strategy called multi-task learning ( MTL ) , have been shown to improve predictions . A second challenge is that combinations of bnAbs are required to avoid the inevitable resistance to a single bnAb , and computationally determining optimal combinations of bnAbs is an unsolved problem . One challenge is that some HIV-1 subtypes in currently available training datasets are underrepresented , which likely affects models ' generalizability across subtypes . We develop a new model and show that , beyond the boost in performance , MTL also helps address the previous two challenges . com/iaime/LBUM , can be adapted to other infectious diseases that are treated with antibody therapy . The ability to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs ) will increase bnAb therapeutic benefits . Machine learning is a powerful approach for such prediction . Our analyses , publicly available at https : //github .
[INTRODUCTION] The generalizability of these methods beyond the training data is unclear , as the training datasets have HIV-1 subtype compositions that are unrepresentative of large epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa ( S1 Fig ) , where the two thirds of people living with HIV-1 worldwide reside . For example , in two separate phase 1b clinical trials , the combination of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 achieved viral suppression for roughly 20 weeks without antiretroviral therapy in 9 out of 11 individuals ( pre-selected for antibody sensitivity ) , and in 13 out of 17 individuals ( not pre-selected for antibody sensitivity ) , respectively . Specifically , we empirically show that : a ) MTL can mitigate bias against underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes ; b ) MTL allows learning patterns of co-resistance between antibodies , thus providing tools to predict antibodies ' epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations . Here we show that , in addition to a boost in performance in some cases , MTL provides solutions , at least partially , to the challenges related to data imbalances and to the selection of optimal bnAb combinations . In particular , when the goal is to identify bnAbs that are likely to neutralize most viruses in a given population , there is the need for scalable computational methods to predict Env sequences ' sensitivity to bnAbs . Given that bnAbs target HIV 's envelope glycoprotein ( Env ) , neutralization assays are traditionally used to determine the breadth and potency of different bnAbs against panels of Env-pseudotyped viruses . Several machine
[RESULTS] We assessed models using three metrics : the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC ) , interpreted as the probability that a model ranks resistant sequences above sensitive ones ; the area under the precision-recall curve ( PR AUC ) , which measures how the model trades off precision for sensitivity , an important metric especially when resistant sequences are rare ; and the binary cross-entropy ( Log Loss ) , which measures the difference between predicted resistance probabilities and the ground truth . We considered 33
[DISCUSSION] Although no solution trumps having all subtypes represented in bnAb data , our results suggest that MTL can alleviate subtype bias if neutralization data with all subtypes is available for antibodies not considered bnAbs ( Figs 1C , S5C and S6C ) . As for previous methods , all models in this work were trained to predict in vitro bnAb resistance : we did not validate them with clinical outcomes , and we relied on data showing correlations between in vitro susceptibility to bnAbs and in vivo outcomes . We first showed that the LBUM 's performance is comparable to that of Gradient Boosting Machine ( GBM ) models and Random Forest ( RF ) models , with some improvements over both methods ( Tables 1 and 2 and S2 Fig and S1 and S2 Files ) . In this regard , our methods can be used to generate hypotheses about epitopes targeted by new antibodies , as long as relevant neutralization data is part of the LBUM 's training data . Nonetheless , some bnAbs had distant contexts despite targeting similar epitopes ( Fig 2 and Table 3 ) , and we highlighted a known example that supports our hypothesis that differences in antibody contexts may capture differences in resistance profiles . Unlike the other two methods , the LBUM does not require aligning input Env sequences , which is an advantage given the

[ABSTRACT] The results showed that group lasso incorporating Vax pathway information ( Vax ( grp ) ) was more competitive in prediction than the gene model in both internal and external validation . Moreover , the new model was more resistant to missing values , and the presence of missing values ( < 5 % ) would not evidently deteriorate its prediction accuracy using our missing data imputation method . Most previous models were constructed at the gene level , ignoring the fact that the dysfunction of the pathway is closely associated with disease development and progression . The present study considered two strategies that construct predictive models by taking pathway information into consideration : pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information . We implemented these methods in microarray data for MM and obtained a candidate model with the best prediction performance in interval validation . The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients , highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for informed therapeutic decision-making . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a hematological disease exhibiting aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow . We considered three methods for pathway score calculation ( ssGSEA , GSVA , and z-scores ) and 14 data sources providing pathway information . The candidate model is further compared with the gene-based model and previously published models in two external data . com/ShuoStat/MMMs ) , where a missing data imputation method was also integrated to facilitate future validation . In a nutshell , pathway-based models ( using group lasso ) were competitive alternatives to gene-based models for MM . The former simply converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for model fitting . Immune information , including VAX pathways , seemed to be more predictive for MM . We also investigated the effects of missing values on prediction . These models were documented in an R package ( https : //github . Vax ( grp ) also outperformed the previously published models .
[INTRODUCTION] However , pathway-based models are considered to be more robust to uncontrolled variation as they incorporate well-established prior knowledge which can significantly reduce the variance caused by noise variables . However , few of them have been applied in practice for several reasons , including insufficient predictive accuracy , lack of generalization to the whole population , and poor model reporting . In this light , the present study explored two possible strategies that incorporated pathway information in model building : pathway score methods ( including ssGSEA , GSVA , and z-score ) and group lasso . Our computational workflow can also serve as a comprehensive guidebook for future studies where prior knowledge needs to be incorporated into predictive models . We implemented these methods in several MM data , investigating their properties and comparing their prediction performance with the gene-based model and previously published models . In addition , gene-based models ( particularly sparse models ) encounter challenges when applied to other datasets due to genetic heterogeneity and measurement errors . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) usually starts from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance ( MGUS ) , progresses to symptomatic multiple myeloma ( SMM ) , and ultimately develops into MM . The selected pathway models can directly reflect the relevance between biological functions ( instead of individual genes ) and survival outcomes . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a hematological disease exhibiting aberrant
[RESULTS] Overall , compared to the time required to generate gene expression data for new patients , which may take days to weeks , the time required for running our bioinformatic pipeline is negligible and therefore does not introduce significant hurdles for clinical translation . For both GSE2658 and GSE9782 , the C-index for all three methods remained almost unchanged with less than 2 % missing values , and experienced a slight increase in variance if the percentage of missing values was 5
[DISCUSSION] Due to the collinearity of the gene expression profile ( many genes show high correlation with each other ) and the regularization ( e. g. Lasso penalty ) during feature selection , the genes selected in the model are not readily interpretable as genes correlated with the selected ones may be randomly dropped by the model , but they may have important biological functions . For example , in our study , the two most predictive models are those based on immune-related pathways , which is consistent with the fact that Multiple Myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells , which produce antibodies and therefore are a critical component of the adaptive immune system . To make our method more generalizable , a border benchmark study in the future is required to test whether the pathway-based models improve patient stratification in our cancer types and which knowledge database should be used for a specific disease . Most importantly , any models still need to undergo rigorous clinical trials before the approved by regulatory bodies , such as the FDA in the United States or the EMA in Europe , and the eventual applications in routine clinical practice . Secondly , while our model proposed Vax , a computational pathway database of vaccination related

[ABSTRACT] We develop a nonlinear dynamical systems model of dynamin related protein one ( Drp1 ) -dependent mitochondrial fission and use it to identify parameters which can regulate the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time . The TFR defined from a nondimensionalization of the model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k - where M is the total concentration of mitochondrial fission factor ( Mff ) and k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane . Though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters , we found the TFR and the cumulative total fission ( TF ) depend strongly on only one , μ. Interestingly , the cumulative TF does not monotonically increase as μ increases . Thus , there is a critical need to understand the molecular mechanisms coordinating and regulating the complex process of mitochondrial fission . Mitochondrial hyperfission in response to cellular insult is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death . This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests interventions targeting k+ , k− , or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism . Thus understanding the impact of regulatory parameters , such as μ , may assist future therapeutic target selection . Instead it increases with μ to a certain point and then begins to decrease as μ continues to increase . The variable μ can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers .
[INTRODUCTION] We develop a nonlinear dynamical system for a Drp1-dependent fission mechanism and use parameter sensitivity analyses , bifurcation analysis , and a nondimensionalization of the model to identify which parameters have the greatest effect on the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time . The TFR defined from the nondimensionalization of the Fission Model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k - , where M is the total concentration on Mff ; k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants , respectively , between oligomers and single Drp1-Mff complexes on the outer mitochondrial membrane . Even though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters , we found the cumulative total fission ( TF ) , which is the total number of fission events over a set time period , depends strongly on only one of them , μ. Disruptions in the balance between fission and fusion has also been observed to affect normal development , and these disruptions have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases indicating that a balance between fission and fusion is crucial to cell health across diverse cell types . While Drp1 recruitment , oligomerization , and interaction with outer mitochondrial membrane receptors is known to occur , the specific contributions of these processes to the fission rate is incompletely understood . Further in vivo studies in rats demonstrate that inhibiting hyperfission in early stages of ischemia protect against long-term ischemic injury including a decrease in infarct size and improvement in function . In
[RESULTS] The lack of information in the literature about the association and dissociation rate constants between Drp1 and Mff ( k1 , k−1 ) , oligomerization on the OMM ( k+ , k− ) , and the rate of mitochondrial fission ( f ( i ) ) motivated our investigation of how different parameter choices affect the total fission rate with the goal of identifying regulatory parameters which fine tune mitochondrial fission . Similar to Eqs ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) , the dimensionless conserved quantities are T M=
[DISCUSSION] Since individual variations in these parameters affected the qualitative behavior of the TFR ( Fig 6 ) and caused the variation seen in the cumulative TF ( Tables 2 and 3 and Fig 8 ) , we expected the combination μ = k + M k - , which can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane , to also have an effect . Through this investigation , we found the number of fission events per second , the TFR ( Eq ( 15 ) ) depends strongly on k+ , k− , and M. Individual variations in these three parameters cause the TFR curve to transition from damped oscillations that reach a steady-state to sustained , stable oscillations . With a nonlinear dynamical system , sensitivity analyses , a nondimensionalization of the system , and a bifurcation analysis we begin to understand how certain parameters affect the total fission rate ( TFR ) which is the number of fission events per second . Incorporating more complex biological processes like ER-mitochondria interactions would possibly call for association and dissociation rate constants k+ and k− that depend on oligomer size or oligomer location on the OMM . If we consider β = k 1 M k - to be less than 5 and fix μ to be greater than or equal to the bifurcation",,912,94,None,"Mitochondrial hyperfission in response to cellular insult is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death .

[ABSTRACT] Our investigation revealed only a low level of homing in the germline , but feeding octopamine restored the egg-laying defects in Tdc2 mutant females , allowing easier line maintenance than for other suppression drive targets . We tested the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency . Our findings show that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles , and the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity . Furthermore , this study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive , offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects . In this study , we constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( Tdc2 ) in Drosophila suzukii , a notorious fruit pest . One approach to mitigate the development of resistance involves targeting functionally constrained regions using multiple gRNAs . CRISPR-based gene drives offer promising prospects for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests . A significant challenge for successful suppression-type drive is the rapid evolution of resistance alleles .
[INTRODUCTION] Targeting the female-specific exon of the dsx gene , a recently created CRISPR/Cas9-based split gene drive ( sGD ) system in SWD showed 94-99 % transmission rates with a line that expressed Cas9 with two nuclear localization sequences from the D. suzukii nanos promoter . Because the drive itself causes recessive female sterility , another important technical aspect of this approach is how to keep large-scale rearing for area-wide releases with a homing suppression element that would otherwise crash due to female sterility . A single point mutation in the active site of Tdc2 , disrupting the production of octopamine in the nervous system , results in female sterility due to impaired oviductal contractions and egg retention in homozygous females , while heterozygotes are normal . Thus , a homing suppression drive targeting a female fertility gene can slow down the development of resistance alleles because any sequence alternation , including in-frame indels , would incur substantial fitness costs . If this process of directional gene conversion , also known as homing , is highly efficient , the drive allele will be inherited in a manner that surpasses typical Mendelian inheritance patterns ( > 50 % ) . It should be noted that in this research we use the term `` resistance '' broadly refer to alleles formed by end-joining repair , causing mutations that prevent their cleavage by the drive . More importantly , this characteristic can be restored through octopamine feeding , indicating that Tdc2 is a potential target for gene drives and enabling conditional rescue of the homozygous drive phenotype
[RESULTS] To determine the underlying reason for the low homing rates in our gene drive system compared to those with high conversion efficiency such as 94-99 % in D. suzukii , we isolated genomic DNA of G0 , G1 , and G2 DsTdc2CRISPR adults to amplify the fragments surrounding the target sequence by PCR ( S4A Fig ) . Our results showed a steady decline in the proportion of DsRed individuals in the population ( Fig 3C ) , the rate of which was broadly consistent with our modeling result based on
[DISCUSSION] While the fecundity of heterozygous females in our individual crosses was not apparently different from wild-type , this may not be the case in population cages , which might be more vulnerable to changes of food condition , population density , peer competition for resources , etc . We suspect that the insertion of a large gene drive cassette in the Tdc2 locus might impact neighboring Tdc1 expression and partially rescue the Tdc2 phenotype , potentially allowing the issue to be solved with drive design adjustments such as reversing the orientation of some genes within the drive . Using gene drive to manage invasive pest SWD is a promising and innovative approach , but as a species with a high level of genetic polymorphism , such genetic background may have a significant impact on the effective spread of gene drive through populations . However , a single injection of donor plasmid containing gRNAs and our vasa-Cas9 into the embryo of SWD achieved successful genome editing , which showed , together with some drive activity , that our vasa promoter was functional in this system . This may facilitate large-scale breeding of gene drive flies and contribute to commercial production , reducing costs , implying rearing , and potentially even allowing mass-rearing strategies and continuous releases that require reduced drive performance for successful suppression . In our system , the vasa promoter ( which has usually given similar

[ABSTRACT] Based on a parsimonious energy model , we propose two plasticity restricting algorithms that save energy : 1 ) only modify synapses with large updates , and 2 ) restrict plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network . Experiments have shown that learning simple conditioning tasks which might require only a few synaptic updates , already carries a significant metabolic cost . In biology networks are often much larger than the task requires , yet vanilla backprop prescribes to update all synapses . In particular in this case , large savings can be achieved while only incurring a slightly worse learning time . Yet , learning a task like MNIST to 95 % accuracy appears to require at least 108 synaptic updates . The brain is not only constrained by energy needed to fuel computation , but it is also constrained by energy needed to form memories . Moreover , the algorithms might benefit hardware because also electronic memory storage is energetically costly . Therefore the brain has likely evolved to be able to learn using as little energy as possible . The results might lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a better match between artificial and biological learning . We explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks . Thus competitively restricting plasticity helps to save metabolic energy associated to synaptic plasticity .
[INTRODUCTION] While neural networks trained with back-propagation are an abstraction of biological learning , it allows for an effective way to teach networks complex associations that is currently not matched by more biological networks or algorithms . However , learning itself is also energetically costly : in classical conditioning experiments with flies the formation of long-term memory reduced lifespan by 20 % when the flies were subsequently starved . This stands in stark contrast with traditional backprop which updates every synapse on every trial and , as we shall see , can lead to very inefficient learning . Our study is inspired by experimental observations that despite common fluctuations in synaptic strength , the number of synapses undergoing permanent modification appears restricted . Biological implementations of back-propagation have been suggested , e. g. , but it is likely that these are less energy efficient as learning times are typically longer . As precise metabolic cost models for plasticity are not yet available , we aim at algorithmic principles rather than energy efficient biophysical mechanisms . Though it constitutes approximately 2 % of human body mass , it is responsible for roughly 20 % of basal metabolism-continuously consuming some 20W . Including energy constraints could lead to computational learning rules more closely resembling biology , and a better understanding of observed synaptic plasticity rules . Carefully selecting which synapses to modify can prevent overwriting previously stored information , also known as catastrophic forgetting . Recent studies have started to explore algorithms that reduce these costs by limiting the updates
[RESULTS] Because our setup rules out that synaptic updates are accidentally exactly zero ( see Methods ) , the number of non-zero updates is the total number of synapses in the network multiplied by the number of iterations T. Larger networks learn a bit quicker than smaller ones , approximately scaling as T ∝ N h - 0 . For large networks both energy measures scale as m ∝ N h. A similar approach is to mask on a per neuron basis and only allow plasticity in a fixed subset
[DISCUSSION] Extrapolating Fig 1 , if plasticity were distributed over all these synapses ( as backprop prescribes ) , the number of synaptic updates would be some 105 times larger than required . For neural networks that learn more complicated tasks , energy costs can according to our model become very high , in particular when networks are large . This is most efficient when the plasticity on input and output side of a neuron are coordinated , so that when inputs of a neuron are modified then so are its outputs . In particular the independence assumption is unlikely to be fully correct ; yet even the sign of the interactions ( cooperative vs competitive ) is unknown . Future studies could include how the saving algorithms should be automatically adapted dependent on task difficulty or network architecture . As more experimental data becomes available , the energy model can be refined and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms can be re-examined . Given the lack of biological data and the uncertain nature of the main energy consumer , our proposed energy model is currently coarse . The M1 energy , which increases less steeply with network size , would still be some 700 times larger , Fig 5 . Finally , we did not consider the energy required for neural signaling , such as synaptic transmission and spike generation .
[METHODS] Instead , we propose a generic model for the metabolic energy M of synaptic plasticity under the following assumptions : Under the assumption of spatial and temporal independence , we still require an expression how much modification of a single synapse costs . For classification tasks it is common to apply a soft-max non-linearity yi = exp ( hi ) /∑j exp hj",,952,96,None,"The brain is not only constrained by energy needed to fuel computation , but it is also constrained to form memories .

[ABSTRACT] We investigated how and to what extent laboratory evolution could overcome these defects in six variants of the transposon-free Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx that each had a deletion of a different 22- to 42-kilobase region and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases . The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd ( ribonuclease D ) , csrA ( RNA-binding carbon storage regulator ) , and hfq ( RNA-binding protein and chaperone ) were frequently mutated across all strains , though the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment . More generally , our results demonstrate that fitness lost during genome streamlining can usually be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution and that recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments . We evolved replicate populations of ADP1-ISx and each deletion strain for ~300 generations in a chemically defined minimal medium or a complex medium and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates . Mutations in this regulatory network likely compensate for how an earlier deletion of a transposon in the ADP1-ISx ancestor of all the deletion strains restored csrA function . During natural or engineered genome streamlining , deletion of many non-essential genes in combination often reduces bacterial fitness for idiosyncratic or unknown reasons . Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors . Synthetic biologists have purposefully engineered streamlined microbial genomes to create more efficient cellular chassis and define the minimal components of cellular life . Fitness increased in all cases that were examined except for two ancestors that each failed to improve in one of the two environments . Organelles and endosymbionts have naturally evolved dramatically reduced genome sizes compared to their free-living ancestors .
[INTRODUCTION] Streamlining can be especially beneficial for metabolic engineering , when extraneous pathways redirect resources away from a desired product , as has been shown by deleting genes to increase antibiotic production in Streptomyces avermitilis and recombinant protein production in Pseudomonas putida and Lactococcus lactis . Deletion of multiple , large genomic regions can also remove genes that individually have little impact on a cell 's function but when removed together produce synthetic lethality or are more deleterious than expected due to `` synthetic-sick '' interactions . In light of these results , questions still remain about the impact of large deletions on an organism 's fitness and how and whether laboratory evolution can recover lost fitness after this type of genome reduction . Removing what have been called `` quasi-essential '' genes can result in fitness defects due to disrupting metabolic networks , reducing stress tolerance , or perturbing global gene expression , among other possibilities . However , little is known about the detailed dynamics of natural streamlining , as most of our understanding of genome reduction comes from comparing the very different genomes of endosymbionts and their free-living relatives . It has been argued that streamlined genomes provide two major benefits to synthetic biology : removing genes that are detrimental in an environment of interest and reducing the complexity of cellular networks [ 4-7 ] . Previously , we engineered strains of the metabolically versatile and naturally competent bacterium
[RESULTS] We also examined a retained genome region ( RGR ) strain with a partially successful deletion , leading to loss of only six genes ( RGR7 ) , as an additional wild-type-like control , and two multiple-segment deletion ( MSD ) strains ( MSD1 and MSD2 ) that were created by combining or expanding deletions in the original MGD strains . We evolved replicate populations of each of the six MGD , one RGR , and two MSD strains plus ADP1-ISx controls for
[DISCUSSION] Given that microbes that naturally evolve extremely reduced genomes generally become less robust , it remains to be seen how far these endeavors that seek to build , remodel , and evolve streamlined genomes can be pushed , whether their goals are to optimize microbial cell factories or understand the essential genetic architectures of cellular life . Further streamlining of A. baylyi genomes to include these deletions and others that could not be constructed would require debugging , for example , by adding back any `` irreplaceable '' genes that are needed to restore viability and fitness in ways that evolution on laboratory timescales can not achieve . Prior evolutionary studies of reduced-genome E. coli observed changes in translation rather than post-transcriptional regulation , and there was little fitness recovery for reduced-genome B. subtilis strains in a complex medium , suggesting that mutations in different global processes may be more beneficial in different organisms with different sets of genes deleted . Yet , mutations in both rnd and csrA evolved in at least one descendant of every engineered deletion stain and their ADP1-ISx progenitor , so-despite the idiosyncratic effects of specific mutations-altering this regulatory network in some way is widely beneficial . In these cases , the engineered deletion seems to have eliminated one more genes with
[METHODS] Dual-indexed Illumina sequencing libraries were constructed using 100 ng of genomic DNA as input into the 2S Turbo kit ( Swift Biosciences ) as per the manufacturer 's instructions except that reaction volumes were conducted in 20 % of the standard volume , the post-ligation bead clean up step was eluted directly into the PCR master mix , and",,969,97,None,"During natural or engineered genome streamlining , deletion of many non-essential genes in combination often reduces bacterial fitness for idiosyncratic or unknown reasons .

[ABSTRACT] Using an in vivo reporter strategy , we first show that inserting the T3H48 self-cleaving ribozyme in an intron enables rapid pre-mRNA cleavage , with up to 20-fold reduction in expression , and that this ribozyme displays superior activity compared with other ribozymes . Furthermore , we show that a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter in the RiboFlip cassette can label knocked-down cells independently of the expression of the target gene . We then inserted the T3H48 ribozyme in the second intron of the albino gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and observed a pigmentation phenotype similar to that in the mutant . Altogether , we introduce the RiboFlip cassette as a flexible tool to control endogenous gene expression in a vertebrate model and as an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies . In addition , we generated a Flippase- and Cre-activatable version of the T3H48 ribozyme , called RiboFlip , to control the mRNA levels of the albino gene . Using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme , we also show that this phenotype is reversible , illustrating the specificity of the approach . Here , we develop a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebrafish . Precise regulation of gene expression is essential to understand a wide range of biological processes . Control over gene expression can be achieved using site-directed recombinases and endonucleases . RiboFlip activation induced mRNA knockdown and also recapitulated the albino mutant phenotype . However , their efficiency is variable and dependent on the genomic context .
[INTRODUCTION] We first use a GFP reporter assay to assess the efficiency of several self-cleaving ribozymes in reducing pre-mRNA levels and find that the T3H48 hammerhead ribozyme ( T3H48-HHR ) , when placed in an intron , causes a 20-fold reduction in eGFP mRNA . Although this approach has proven to be efficient in regulating exogenous constructs , it remains unclear whether engineered self-cleaving ribozymes can control endogenous gene expression in vertebrates . Multiple site-directed tools are available to control gene knockout , including recombinase systems such as Cre/LOX , Flp/FRT , and Dre/ROX , as well as endonuclease-mediated CRISPR editing . To circumvent this issue , an artificial Schistosoma mansoni hammerhead ribozyme , called T3H48 , which displays a dramatic increase in cleavage rate has recently been engineered . One limitation to efficient RNA degradation is the slow cleavage kinetics , which makes most natural self-cleaving ribozymes unsuitable for in vivo applications . However , these systems are not available in all vertebrate models , are challenging to implement , and display variable efficiency depending on the genomic context . This approach has been used to modulate transgene stability in multiple models , including human and mouse cells [ 6-9 ] , C. elegans , Drosophila , and Plasmodium . One promising family of RNA regulatory elements consists of self-cleaving ribozymes , which are short RNA structures capable of catalyzing their own cleavage . Spatiotemporal control of gene knockout has become the standard approach in vertebrate model organisms to investigate RNA and
[RESULTS] We also included universal CRISPR/SpyCas9 and CRISPR/LbaCas12a sites on the RiboFlip cassette ( Figs 3a and S3a ) , so that it can be targeted for knockout ( S4c Fig ) or used as a landing site for the additional knockin of an mRFP reporter ( S4d , e Fig ) . We show that Cre activation of the albR-OFF allele can be reported using the GAL4/UAS system , after Gal4 mRNA injection at the one-cell-stage ( S4f-g Fig ) , and turned off using the Dre/ROX
[DISCUSSION] This difference could be due to a positional effect of the ribozyme , whose folding depends on the neighboring sequences , or by the shorter insulating sequence used in this experiment to reduce the size of the ssODN donor for knockin . Considering the high stability of melanin , the recovery in albHHR/HHR larvae is likely due to Alb protein accumulation , since the ribozyme cleavage efficiency did not appear to diminish over time ( S2g Fig ) . Although TagBFP expression became visible after Gal4 expression , the signal was weak and mosaic , possibly due to a suboptimal design , as a large sequence separates the UAS from the TagBFP , or to the genomic context in the alb gene . We also used CRISPR/Cas9 knockin strategies to insert an inducible T3H48-HHR cassette called RiboFlip and show that this system can trigger conditional gene knockdown of the endogenous alb gene . We propose this approach as an new method to turn off the activity of HHR ribozymes in vivo , notably as an alternative to aptamers designed to change the conformation of self-cleaving ribozymes upon drug binding . To that end , we created a RiboFlip cassette that switches T3H48-HHR to a sense orientation following Flippase or Cre recombination and inserted it in the second intron of the alb gene . Moreover , the mRNA

[ABSTRACT] We extensively evaluated it for nucleus segmentation in different primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities in hand-curated published and novel imaging data sets . Here , we introduce `` aiSEGcell '' a user-friendly CNN-based software to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images . This eliminates the need for transgenic or dye fluorescent labeling , frees up imaging channels , reduces phototoxicity and speeds up imaging . It retains biologically relevant information , e. g. for demanding quantification of noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics . aiSEGcell accurately segments nuclei from even challenging bright field images , very similar to manual segmentation . aiSEGcell is readily adaptable to new use cases with only 32 images required for retraining . Convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) can detect these structures also in only transmitted light images . It is agnostic to computational environments and does not require user expert coding experience . aiSEGcell is accessible through both a command line , and a napari graphical user interface . However , this approach currently requires optimized experimental conditions and computational specialists . Segmentation is required to quantify cellular structures in microscopic images . We provide this curated ground-truth data with 1 . This typically requires their fluorescent labeling . 1 million nuclei in 20 , 000 images .
[INTRODUCTION] Albeit visible in transmitted light images , features indicative of even a large organelle like the nucleus are complex , vary between cell types , and over time , for example due to cell differentiation , cell movement or changes in the focal plane . However , it is uncertain whether nuclei can be accurately segmented under challenging typical imaging conditions optimized for speed and cells ' health and not for perfect images , such as low magnification BF microscopy . We show that our trained instance of aiSEGcell is transferable to unseen experimental conditions and adaptable to other use cases , like novel cell types , only requiring 32 images for retraining . Neural networks excel at discovering complex informative features and are not limited to specific imaging conditions or cell types if trained on a large representative data set [ 8-11 ] . Conventional computer-assisted image segmentation is semi-automated and necessitates good signal-to-noise , using a dedicated fluorescence channel for segmenting cells , nuclei , or other targets [ 3-5 ] . aiSEGcell is accessible through a command line interface ( CLI ) or a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , a napari plugin , tested by users with varying coding experience in different computational environments . However , dedicating a fluorescence channel to facilitate image segmentation loses a channel that would otherwise be available to image other relevant targets and increases imaging phototoxicity and required acquisition times . It is usually the first step in image analysis pipelines to identify tissues , cells or subcellular
[RESULTS] This range approximately corresponds to the radius of most primary hematopoietic cells , suggesting that aiSEGcell can accurately segment nuclei in BF as long as the focal plane aligns with parts of the nucleus and demonstrating its robustness to focus changes ( S2 and S6 Figs and S7 and S8 Tables ) . The translocation of fluorescently labeled signaling molecules from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and vice versa , in small motile live primary cells imaged with low signal-to-noise is demanding , sensitive to variations in the nuclear mask
[DISCUSSION] Hence , users can retrain an existing aiSEGcell model or train a new aiSEGcell model to segment other objects in different 2D image modalities , for example fluorescently labeled blood vessels or cell organelles in electron microscopy , etc. , further enhancing its utility in a wide range of applications . We now show that nuclear segmentations in BF are also feasible in challenging common experimental conditions like low magnification , and time lapse imaging of e. g. small non-adherent primary murine and human hematopoietic cells imaged in microfluidic and other culture devices . Notably , we prove that these segmentations are so similar to manual segmentation that they retain biologically meaningful information even when using the segmentation as the basis for quantification of difficult and noisy reporters like biosensors for cell signaling dynamics . Hence , we share our data sets D1-5 containing manually curated nuclear marker ground truth segmentations of more than 20 , 000 images , or 1 , 100 , 000 nuclei , covering 11 unique cell types ( one cell line , 10 primary cell types ; Figs 1-3 and Table 1 ) . New machine learning methods are often available as public code repositories that lack the necessary testing to ensure compatibility with different computational environments and are not actively maintained . The ability to generalize to many use cases is a sought-after feature in trained neural

[ABSTRACT] Testing how feature speed could affect learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature , and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes . To test this idea , 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward . Across two experiments and one preregistered replication , participants accrued more reward when a bandit 's relevant feature changed slowly , and its irrelevant feature quickly , as compared to the opposite . One such property is the rate of change of features , given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise . We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features . The larger the improvement in participants ' performance for slow compared to fast bandits , the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates . These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features , suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning . Hence , we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast . We did not find a difference in the ability to generalise to unseen feature values between conditions . Identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour .
[INTRODUCTION] The resulting decision-making biases are numerous [ 10-13 ] and can for instance be observed in the form of adaptive heuristics that reflect constraints on time or resources , or in the form of visual illusions that reflect the simplifying assumptions of our visual system , such as that light tends to come from above . Studying useful priors for representation learning is also an active field of development in artificial intelligence [ 8 , 16-18 ] , in particular for reinforcement learning ( RL ) , where knowledge about which actions maximise reward and minimise punishment is acquired through a trial-and-error process . One approach to this problem is to not learn every problem anew , but instead use knowledge of properties that have been relevant in the past as a starting point , in the form of so-called priors , also known as inductive biases [ 3-7 ] . Theoretical research also demonstrated that extracting slow features can explain the activity of complex cells in the visual cortex , the formation of allocentric spatial maps in the hippocampus and can be implemented in a biologically plausible network [ 44-48 ] . The space of possibilities is often too large to be explored fully within the time limits we need to consider , and yet limiting attention to only a subset of features risks ignoring relevant information . For example , the appearance of a ball flying toward you in a park might fluctuate rapidly as it passes through patches of sun
[RESULTS] Finally , the model 's choice was guided by the probability of the value of accepting , Va , t , being larger than a normal random variable centred on 50 ( the value of rejecting ) , with standard deviation σ : p ( accept ) = P [ X ≤ V a , t ] X ∼ N ( 50 , σ 2 ) ( 5 ) While all of the four models reported here used the above-described mechanisms , they differed in whether they could
[DISCUSSION] Our findings are in line with previous research showing that priors have a pervasive influence on behaviour , shaping perception , remaining stable in the face of exposure to contradictory training , and hindering learning of structures which do not align with them . By providing empirical evidence for the role of a slowness prior in human learning and connecting to a large number of machine learning findings , our study sheds light onto how humans might rapidly learn representations in complex environments . We chose this approach for its computational simplicity , but it remains a potential avenue for future research to set up models which do not assign relevant and irrelevant learning rates a priori , but infer these assignments through learning . While it is reasonable to assume that participants in experiment 2 and the replication knew the speed of the features based on the preceding observation phase , they could not yet have known which feature was relevant . Nonetheless , the fact that a model with this assumption fits best and participants ' accuracy increased within the first learning trials in a block , lead us to believe that participants quickly developed a sense for the relevance of the features . To investigate whether humans employ a slowness prior to identify potentially relevant features during reinforcement learning , we tested participants in a
[METHODS] By controlling the relevant feature positions of the two stimuli , it was possible to probe choices from easier comparisons , where stimuli had more distinct values ( the maximum included difference was 54 coins ) , to increasingly difficult comparisons , where the values of the two stimuli were more similar ( the minimum difference was 13 coins in experiment 1",,961,96,None,"In order to achieve a goal , we need to be able to identify the features that are relevant to the task . One such property is the rate of change of features , given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise .

[ABSTRACT] CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed to the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model ( MMTV-PyMT ) demonstrated that reduction of Resf1 resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth , a shortened overall survival time , and increased incidence and number of lung metastases , consistent with patient data . Patients with ER-negative breast cancer have the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes , often experiencing rapid recurrence or progression to metastatic disease shortly after diagnosis . Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Resf1 in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences , particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis . These results suggest that loss of Resf1 enhances tumor progression in ER- breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control . Furthermore , an analysis of matched tail and primary tissues revealed loss of the wildtype copy in tumor tissue , consistent with Resf1 being a tumor suppressor . Given that metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors , understanding metastatic biology is crucial for effective intervention . Here , we extend those studies to identify Resf1 , a poorly characterized gene , as a novel metastasis susceptibility gene in ER- breast cancer . Resf1 is a large , unstructured protein with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure , but with poor amino acid conservation . Using a mouse systems genetics approach , we previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility .
[INTRODUCTION] These findings suggest that metastatic disease may be driven more by metastasis-associated transcriptional programs mediated by changes in gene copy number , structural rearrangements , and responses to specific environmental conditions , rather than constitutional activation or inactivation of specific pathways . In this study , we expand upon these previous findings and provide evidence that an additional gene within this interval , Retroviral silencing factor 1 ( Resf1 ) , is a potential tumor suppressor and metastasis modifier in ER-negative breast cancer . In one cross involving the Japanese-derived MOLF/EiJ mouse strain , five genes on the distal end of mouse chromosome 6 were implicated in the progression of ER-negative ( ER- ) breast cancer , including the circadian rhythm transcription factor Arntl2 . Variations in most population phenotypes , including disease ( excluding high-penetrant mutation carriers like Li-Fraumeni Syndrome ) , are believed to arise from transcriptomic changes caused by polymorphisms within gene regulatory elements . The identification of polymorphic metastasis susceptibility genes that can alter regulatory networks and transcriptional states through classical meiotic genetic screens , coupled with newer genomic technologies , offers an alternative method for gene identification . This is best highlighted by the fact that the current five-year survival rate of patients with localized disease is approximately 90 % , but drops to 31 % when patients develop distant metastatic disease . The current leading theory is the Nowell Hypothesis , which posits that metastatic capacity is achieved through the cumulative acquisition of metastatic traits due to the
[RESULTS] Furthermore , mTOR antibody arrays to investigate alterations in translational efficiency ( S7 Fig ) and western blot analysis of critical canonical unfolded protein response ( UPR ) targets showed no significant changes between control and KD cell lines grown on glass or plastic culture surface with and without prior tunicamycin ( TM ) treatment for UPR activation ( S8 Fig ) . However , given that opposite results were observed between the allograft and autochthonous GEM model metastasis assays and that previous work from our laboratory has
[DISCUSSION] This is exemplified by analysis of the RPL27 , where RESF1 showed significant association only across exon 3 , which contains three DNA G4s distributed on both strands , while the other exons have single predicted DNA G4 quadruplexes , all restricted to the non-template strand . The generation and validation of the mouse western blot compatible antibody combined with subcellular fractionation suggest that RESF1 is primarily a nucleoplasmic protein , though staining of the dTAG CRISPR knockin cells suggests that RESF1 is capable of translocating into the nucleolus and nuclear speckle under some circumstances . Because this gene-trap animal has not been extensively characterized and single-gene tumor expression studies can be confounded by amplifications or deletions that include additional genes that might influence the phenotype , we incorporated a second CRISPR-mediated Resf1 KO animal into the study . Despite the concerns regarding the physiological validity of cell line-based models for investigations into the role of RESF1 in metastatic disease , we initiated a series of mechanistic-based studies to identify potential cell line-based RESF1 metastasis-associated pathways or mechanisms that might be subsequently investigated or validated in vivo models . Therefore , while RESF1 may function as a minor histocompatibility antigen in tumor-graft rejection , it does not appear to play a significant role in metastatic progression , at least in the cell line-based orthotopic transplant spontaneous metastasis models .

[ABSTRACT] Despite these differences , complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs-rare in wild-type cells-occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1 , suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both . Here , we utilise two strategies-deletion of the mismatch repair protein , Msh2 , and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor-to help characterise the roles Mec1 and Rad24 play in meiotic recombination by enabling genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny . Collectively , in addition to shared roles in CO regulation , our results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor , and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency , the loss of which helps to suppress any broader defects in CO regulation caused by abrogation of the DDR . During meiosis , programmed DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme , Spo11 , activating the DNA damage response ( DDR ) kinase Mec1ATR via the checkpoint clamp loader , Rad24RAD17 . Such effects are similar to , but less extreme than , the phenotype of 'ZMM ' mutants such as zip3Δ , and may be driven by reductions in the proportion of interfering COs. At single loci , loss of Mec1 and Rad24 activity alters DSB formation and recombination outcome , but their genome-wide roles have not been examined in detail . In line with previous studies , we observe severely impacted spore viability and a reduction in the frequency of recombination upon deletion of RAD24-driven by a shortened prophase . By contrast , loss of Mec1 function increases recombination frequency , consistent with its role in DSB trans-interference , and has less effect on spore viability . Upon loss of either Mec1 or Rad24 , CO distributions become more random-suggesting reductions in the global manifestation of interference . Mec1 and Rad24 also have important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers ( COs ) .
[INTRODUCTION] In most organisms , including mammals and S. cerevisiae , the organism utilised in the work presented here , such recombination-dependent interactions facilitate homologue pairing during leptotene-zygotene , full alignment and connection via the synaptonemal complex at pachytene , and subsequent reductional chromosome segregation at the meiosis I nuclear division . To further establish the roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in the regulation of meiotic recombination , and to determine whether previously inferred roles can be extended genome-wide , we mapped meiotic recombination patterns at high resolution across the S. cerevisiae genome in rad24Δ and mec1-mn ( 'meiotic null ' ) backgrounds , revealing both similar and distinct roles for Mec1 and Rad24 in the regulation of meiotic DSB repair . By sensing ongoing recombination activity and unrepaired DSBs , Mec1 acts as a molecular rheostat to modulate the progression of meiotic prophase via the Mek1 kinase , a paralogue of Rad53 ( CHK2 in mammals ) that regulates the activity of Ndt80 , the transcription factor required for exit from meiotic prophase . In the generalised pathway , DNA damage leads to the activation of Tel1ATM ( Ataxia Telangiectasia-Mutated ) and Mec1ATR ( Rad3-related ) checkpoint kinases ( Human orthologues are indicated with superscript text ) , via the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2NBS1-complex and Rad24RAD17 ( reviewed in ) . The interaction between Mec1 and the 9-1-1 complex also contributes to other Mec1 functions such as phosphorylation of the
[RESULTS] Importantly , although we detected supporting evidence for CO homeostasis in the absence of Rad24 and Mec1 activity , it should be noted that , when the total number of recombination events is low , CO outcomes ( per event ) may be favoured-not just due to homeostasis-but also because COs are likely to provide a selective advantage for accurate chromosome segregation , which is essential to produce viable haploid progeny . To avoid the influence of Mec1 inactivation during premeiotic growth
[DISCUSSION] Taking observations collectively , we speculate that the prior inference for a specific ( Mec1-independent ) role for Rad24 on ZMM loading may stem from the fact that global recombination frequencies ( DSBs and CO outcomes ) are lower in rad24Δ strains than in mec1-mn-potentially due to the loss of DSB trans interference in mec1-mn strains . Interestingly , the effects of mec1-mn described here are similar to those of pch2 mutation , which has been found to cause global increases in DSBs and COs. pch2 mutants also have a significantly lower incidence of non-exchange chromosomes , and CO interference appears weaker compared to wild type . Moreover , given the essential role that COs play in chromosome segregation and fertility in most sexually reproducing organisms , it will be of great interest to clarify whether the DDR checkpoint clamp and/or loader play similar roles across other species as they do in S. cerevisiae . Nevertheless , it seems logical that such biases will tend towards less extreme , more wild type-like phenotypes , suggesting that the characteristics we report here for rad24Δ and mec1-mn are likely to underestimate the true extent of the defects occurring during meiosis . In general , the patches of genetic change arising per recombination event ( event
[METHODS] As 8:0 segregation patterns may arise from rare mitotic recombination events occurring prior to meiosis , 8:0 segments were discarded from analyses if they had no adjacent hDNA , or appeared in the same locus across multiple meioses-suggesting mis-annotation within one of the parental genomic references . This is because even if there is an indel , there",,982,97,None,"In the fungus S . cerevisiae , DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11 , activating the DNA damage response ( DDR ) kinase Mec1ATR via the checkpoint clamp loader Rad24RAD17 . During meiosis , programmed DNA double strand breaks are formed through the activation of the DNA repair response ( DCR ) gene Mec2ATR . The recombination frequency of these breaks is reduced in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1/Rad24 , suggesting a loss of spatial regulation of crossovers ( COs ). Here , we use two strategies , deletion of the mismatch repair protein , Msh2 and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor to characterise the roles of Mec1, Rad24 and Mec1. We show that loss of either of these two factors affects the frequency of recombined spores , whereas loss of both of them has less effect on viability . Collectively , our results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor , and for mec1 as -dependent regulator of crossover frequency . Our results suggest a reduction in the proportion of interfering COs caused by abrogation of this DDR gene ."

[ABSTRACT] In addition , we employ relaxed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches to make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and to identify critical components of the Pneumocystis growth medium .

We present a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism , to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth in vitro . This is largely due to the fact that its experimental dissection has been constrained by the inability to culture the organism in vitro . Despite the major impact of Pneumocystis on human health , limited progress has been made in dissecting the pathobiology of this fungus . P. jirovecii is a deadly pathogen of humans that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients . However , a significant number of bacterial and fungal species , including Pneumocystis jirovecii , remain unculturable , hampering research efforts . Establishing suitable in vitro culture conditions for microorganisms is crucial for dissecting their biology and empowering potential applications .
[INTRODUCTION] In addition , GEMs have been used to design minimal growth media for the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis , a potentially beneficial gut microbe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , and for the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus , Neisseria meningitidis , and Helicobacter pylori . So far , attempts to overcome bioinformatically predicted auxotrophic requirements by simple supplementation of growth media has not been sufficient to solve the problem and achieve long-term growth in vitro , though several groups have reported limited short-term growth . To identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that prevent the growth of this major fungal pathogen in vitro , we have developed , for the first time , a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model ( GEM ) of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism . This powerful approach has been successfully applied to metabolic engineering , strain development , drug discovery , enzyme functional predictions , phenotypic characterisations , interspecies interactions modelling and the understanding of human diseases [ 24-26 ] . By extending this with relaxed Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ) , we show how the model can be used to make important predictions regarding metabolic flux to identify critical components of the Pneumocystis growth medium . The experimental dissection of microorganisms , such as bacteria and fungi , is greatly facilitated through access to suitable in vitro culture conditions that enable their independent growth within a laboratory setting . We review and refine the current Pneumocystis genome annotation using available information in the literature together with well-established bioinformatics tools , and then organise these data into
[RESULTS] For example , FBA has been successfully used to identify and resolve `` knowledge gaps '' in metabolic networks , to study the impact of drugs in pathogens and to identify potential drug targets , to model host-pathogen interactions , to simulate multiple gene knockouts , to predict the yield of important cofactors , and to support metabolic engineering [ 64-66 ] . We then used the brick GENA ( Genome-Based Network Analysis ) of Constellab platform ( see Materials and Methods ) to organise these data into a well-defined
[DISCUSSION] This is extremely important because a reliable in vitro culture method will empower the dissection of Pneumocystis immunology and pathobiology , leading , in the longer-term , to the development of new antifungal therapies that circumvent the emerging resistance of Pneumocystis to azole drugs , and to dramatic advances in Pneumocystis biology and therapy . In addition to the supplementation of nutritional requirements that have been predicted bioinformatically , some of which have been tested already , FBA is capable of predicting how nutrient supplementation might be applied to address metabolic imbalances created , for example by loss of energetic or redox homeostasis . Moreover , FBA does not take account of regulatory effects such as enzyme activation by protein kinases or gene regulation , nor does it consider stress response or signalling pathways , and so its predictions may not always be accurate . By employing a relaxed Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ) approach , we calculated biomass flux values to confirm that our metabolic model is a powerful tool to investigate biological questions that can not be fully explored through conventional bioinformatics and experimental approaches . In order to do so , we reviewed and improved the current Pneumocystis genome annotation by incorporating relevant information from the literature and utilising established bioinformatics tools and then organised this information into a well-defined GEM network .

[ABSTRACT] Finally , this mathematical model , which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway , may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels , developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells , and determining appropriate drug dosages . Herein , a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density , which reflects cell dynamics , into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response . The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells , enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions . However , it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition ( contact inhibition ) under high-density conditions , thereby allowing continuous proliferation . We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics ( MD ) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell . The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density . We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density . We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics . In this study , we construct a three-dimensional ( 3D ) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway . We assume Lennard-Jones ( 12-6 ) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain . This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm , resulting in cell cycle arrest . Conversely , at extremely high cell density , the Hippo pathway , which regulates YAP/TAZ , is activated . Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells . The source codes are freely available .
[INTRODUCTION] Previous studies on cells using MD methods includes cases without proliferations , reactions and diffusions , dynamics of two-species particle systems , mitotic cone formations , multiparticle collisions in aqueous solutions , and 3D models with cell growths and divisions in the context of tumor invasions . Under low-density conditions , MST1/2 and LATS1/2 remain inactive , allowing co-activators Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) to interact with transcription factors , such as TEAD1-4 , in the nucleus , thereby inducing the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival . However , the precise extent of YAP/TAZ protein upregulation in cancer tissues is several-fold higher than that in normal tissues , and measures to evade cell cycle arrest under high-density conditions and trigger sustained chronic proliferation remains poorly understood . By integrating the molecular signaling of the Hippo pathway with cell mechanics and cell cycle dynamics , our study offers new insights into the mechanisms driving cancer proliferation and presents a newly and more dynamic model compared to previous research . While previous studies used the Lennard-Jones ( LJ ) potential for modeling intermolecular forces in MD methods , we used the LJ potential for the adhesion and repulsion of multiple cells , which have softcore characteristics , avoiding sudden increase when the cells are close . Herein , a
[RESULTS] We find solutions to the simultaneous first-order differential equations , Eqs ( 3a ) , ( 3b ) and ( 3c ) , to calculate the time evolutions of the multicellular cells with the parameters in Table B1 of S2 Appendix using the eigen-value problem ( EVP ) formulations in S3 Appendix . For normal tissues , we observe cell cycle arrests in addition to cell proliferation , especially 100 tens of hours later in the time evolution in Fig
[DISCUSSION] In this study , we performed 3D multicellular simulations combining MD methods with reaction network models of the Hippo pathway , which is known to regulate cell proliferation by inhibiting YAP/TAZ activity . Our approach effectively simulated cell division and growth , preventing cell overlap by assigning exclusive domains to each cell with LJ ( 12-6 ) potential with a softcore character , and integrating cell cycle dynamics , particularly the M and G1 phases . Our model 's integration of cell dynamics and intra-cellular dynamics could position it as a tool for evaluating cancer malignancy , exploring therapeutic interventions targeting YAP/TAZ , and optimizing drug dosages . To investigate whether the elevated levels of YAP/TAZ observed in cancer tissues are sufficient to sustain chronic proliferation , we developed models representing time evolutions of normal and cancerous tissues . Our 3D simulations revealed that while normal tissues exhibited cell cycle arrest and suppression of exponential growth , cancer tissues with YAP/TAZ levels twice as high demonstrated continuous exponential proliferation . This innovation allowed us to simulate cell proliferation as an output response , providing a more detailed and dynamic representation of how intracellular signaling modulates cell division decisions . These findings suggest that increased YAP/TAZ alone can bypass

[ABSTRACT] Armed with an energy landscape framework , map diagrams of material and dynamical properties governed by key energy landscape features modulated by the degree of complexity in LCD arrangements , including the periodicity and local disorder in LCDs . Understanding how the molecular sequence grammar of LCDs governs condensate dynamics is essential for uncovering their biological functions and the evolutionary forces that shape these sequences . Our results reveal that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates , thereby avoiding transitions to glassy or solid-like states . Moreover , we demonstrate that the energy landscape framework explains the recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity . Our work provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties whereby key features of energy landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable . To this end , we present an energy landscape framework that operates on a continuous 'stickiness ' energy scale rather than relying on an explicit alphabet-based sequence . Many eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complexity domains ( LCDs ) with a strong propensity for binding and driving phase separation into biomolecular condensates . Mutations in LCDs frequently disrupt condensate dynamics , resulting in pathological transitions to solid-like states . Highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior , while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties . Sequences are characterized by Wasserstein distance relative to thoroughly shuffled or random counterparts .
[INTRODUCTION] To this end , we introduce a Free Energy Landscape of Stickers ( FELaS ) : a model for phase-separating biomolecules that employs a continuous `` stickiness '' scale to investigate the effects of low-complexity sequence patterns on condensate dynamics and material properties . Leveraging an energy landscape framework , we set out to explore the contribution of sequence complexity and periodicity of sticker repeat domains ( Fig 1 ) in dynamic and viscoelastic properties and shed light on recent experiments probing sequence-dependent material properties of condensates . For instance , in recent reports , flow activation energies of various condensate phases were measured , finding that localized sticky motifs in sequences dramatically alter network reconfiguration times in condensates , thereby contributing to observed sequence dependence of viscosities . Moreover , we demonstrate that the energy landscape framework aligns with recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity through sticker periodicity and strength variations . For protein folding , evolutionary pressure has favored sequences that minimize frustrated interactions in proteins [ 23-25 ] , which in turn minimize kinetic traps , thereby ensuring rapid and robust folding to native states . Proteins with LCDs display high conformational flexibility and affinity for binding and phase separation into biomolecular condensates , which engage in numerous organizational , regulatory , and signaling functions . Using FELaS , we also map a broad phase diagram of material properties driven by key energy landscape features , including the periodicity of LCDs and the disorder within LCDs
[RESULTS] Viscoelasticity : Recent microrheology experiments have demonstrated that the material properties of biomolecular condensates can vary widely , ranging from intricate Maxwell fluids to glassy or Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic gels , depending on their composition and maturation times [ 21 , 33-35 ] . In this section , we show that these results fall within the expected range of experimentally characterized material properties despite the limited data available in the literature on the viscoelastic properties of protein condensates with varying sticker and spacer residues ( sequences are listed in the
[DISCUSSION] To understand the puzzling paradoxes of sequence variability consistent with robust functions , we devised a Free Energy Landscape of Stickers ( FELaS ) : a framework for exploring LCD patterns that may be evolutionarily constrained to possess both short-term material properties and long-term stability required for cellular functions . Phase diagrams and dynamical properties also corroborate the rheological trends ; in the case of periodic LCDs , elastic response and viscosity get higher and become more subdiffusive with an increasing periodicity of the sticker motifs . We anticipate that experiments guided by energy landscape considerations will enable more targeted mutations to systematically alter landscape characteristics , providing direct insights into the relationship between biomolecular sequences and condensate dynamics . Thus , decoding how sticky LCD patterns encode the material properties of condensates promises to shed light on the dynamic behavior of condensates , which are intimately linked to their sequence patterns and cellular functions . In contrast , random sequences show homogeneous unstructured bulk systems , which are more viscous , as demonstrated by an order of magnitude difference in viscous moduli compared to the sequences with more periodic patterns of stickers . Computational models have provided further insights into how low-complexity sticky domains and the local rigidity of LCDs contribute to the loss of ergodic dynamics and the transition to glassy states . Using FELaS , we can dissect
[METHODS] From the equilibrium stress autocorrelation function of an isotropic system , one can approximate complex modulus as : G ( t ) =V5kBT [ ⟨Σxy ( 0 ) Σxy ( t ) ⟩+⟨Σyz ( 0 ) Σyz ( t ) ⟩+⟨Σxz ( 0 ) Σxz ( t ) ⟩+16 ( ⟨Nxy ( 0 ) Nxy ( t ) ⟩+⟨Nyz ( 0 ) Nyz",,947,96,None,"Many eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complexity domains ( LCDs ) with a strong propensity for binding and driving phase separation into biomolecular condensates . Mutations in LCDs frequently disrupt condensed dynamics , resulting in pathological transitions to solid-like states . We present an energy landscape framework that operates on a continuous “stickiness” energy scale rather than relying on an explicit alphabet-based sequence . Our results reveal that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condenses , while random sequences exhibit viscoelasticity-dominated properties . Moreover , we demonstrate that the energy landscape model explains the recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in conformational properties through sticky periodicity and strength variations ."

[ABSTRACT] Using the mouse dentition as a model , we first establish that non-muscle myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and show that it functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer . Signaling by secreted molecules is critical for epithelial morphogenesis , but how that information leads to cell rearrangement and tissue shape changes remains an open question . Together , our results support a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through myosin II to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination . The development of ectodermal organs begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that progressively invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme as the organ takes its shape . Pharmacological induction of AKT and myosin II can also rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh . Shh signaling controls these processes by inducing myosin II activation via AKT .
[INTRODUCTION] Through genetic studies in both mice and humans , we now know that many transcription factors and components of signaling pathways play critical roles during tooth development , but how they modulate cell behaviors to control morphogenesis is only beginning to be understood . Incisors and molars next undergo comparable morphological changes as they continue to invaginate into the mesenchyme , progressing through the cap and bell stages until the tooth erupts , although the incisor epithelium develops in an asymmetrical manner and turns posteriorly during the bud-to-cap transition at E13 . It was thus postulated that such a convergent cell movement generates the planar tissue tension observed in the suprabasal layer and is required during dental epithelial invagination to direct the downward bending and growth of the placode towards the mesenchyme . Interestingly , genetic mutations in regulators that function upstream to control actomyosin activity , including GTPase-activating proteins ( GAPs ) and small Rho GTPases , have been recently linked to dental anomalies in humans [ 25-29 ] . Epithelial cells in the hair and mammary placodes undergo similar convergent movement , and cell motilities in these cases are influenced by Wnt and Shh , respectively-signaling pathways central to the development of these organs [ 12-14 ] . It does so by strengthening cell-cell adhesion at adherens junctions and by enabling efficient and persistent convergent cell movement in the suprabasal layer , where cells at the periphery of the tooth bud move towards the midline . However , whether MyoII is required in the epithelium to control its invagination and shape is not understood , and how its activity may be
[RESULTS] However , cell death alone is unlikely to be the main cause of the invagination phenotype observed , as tooth germs with a higher amount of apoptosis still invaginated normally in other genetic mutant mouse embryos that we have worked with , for example with epithelial deletion of Piezo 1 using K14CreER ( S5 Fig ) . Together , these collective convergent cell movements would accompany , on average , 46 % narrowing of the incisor neck region and 26 % lengthening in the epithelial depth over the course of the explant culture (
[DISCUSSION] Our findings here showed that this signaling axis underlies the regulation of MyoII by Shh in the developing incisor , as pAKT was downregulated in cyclopamine-treated samples and pharmacological activation of PI3K/AKT rescued pMLC expression and other cyclopamine-induced phenotypes , including adhesion and cell movement defects . Although MyoII has been shown to exert tension at the contractile ring of dividing cells and is required for cytokinesis in both cultured cells and in some tissues , including the heart [ 58-60 ] , whether it controls cell divisions in the developing tooth was not clear . While Shh is better known for its role as a morphogen to pattern developing tissues and to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation , our results resonate with studies showing that Shh also plays an important role in controlling cell adhesion , cell arrangement , and tissue shape changes during morphogenesis . This is also consistent with prior findings showing that MyoII-generated cellular forces are essential for the maintenance and the growth of adherence junctions in cultured cells , and deletion of myosin IIA and/or IIB results in mislocalized E-cadherin and defective adhesion in mouse embryos . Further dissection of how Shh signals are integrated spatiotemporally to modulate distinct cellular processes and mechanics in the dental placode will be an important next step towards elucidating the mechanism that converts Shh signals into region-specific cell behavioral patterns during tooth morphogenesis . Based on these data , we propose that Shh signaling from

[ABSTRACT] Here , we present a robust deep transfer model based graph convolutional network , scTGCN , which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation , while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption . However , the current label transfer methods have limited performance , largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets . The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological mechanism . We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq . Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data . Thus , scTGCN shows high label transfer accuracy and effectively knowledge transfer across different modalities .
[INTRODUCTION] In this setting , the high efficiency computational methods are scarcely and most existing methods can be classified into two categories : one kind such as Conos , Seurat3 and Liger based nearest neighbor graph structure and matrix factorization . And we explore the idea of MK-MMD-based adaption for learning transferable features in common embedding of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq , enables our model to best leverage the domain-specific effects . Additionally , these methods are mainly targeted towards integrating datasets of less complex tissues and may overcorrect fine-grained cell subpopulations in more complex tissues , resulting in the loss of power to reveal interesting biological variations . Integration of single-cell multi omics data is still a great challenge due to the heterogeneity across multiple datasets , including inherent highly sparse and imcompatible dimension between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data . This model formulates and aggregates cell-cell relationship and gene expression with graph convolutional network , which based on the kenetic relationships between the specific regulatory mechanisms of scRNAseq and scATAC-seq . Other deep learning basesd methods ( review in ) such as scJoint , sciCAN , Poral , scDART , Glue outperform many methods in the situation of integrating unpaired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data . Here , we propose a single-cell transfer graph convolutional network model ( Fig 1b ) , which regard the label transfer from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq as the domain adaption problem in transfer learning ( Fig 1a ) . The methods were proposed for integrating paired and unpaired single cell modalities data , such as DVAE , scMVAE , DCCA , Seurat , MOFA+ and scJoint have limitted performance .
[RESULTS] These measurements can be obtained using techniques such as CITE-seq ( Stoeckius et al ) and ASAP-seq ( Mimito et al ) , Upon examining the tSNE plots , we observe that our method successfully achieves improved clustering of cells based on pre-defined cell types compared to other methods ( Fig 5a ) , integrates the two protocols ( ASAP-seq and CITE-seq ) ( Fig 5b and S2 Fig ) , meanwhile our approach effectively combines the different modalities , resulting in enhanced grouping of cells in accordance with their known cell types (
[DISCUSSION] compared to Seurat , Conos , scJoint and GLUE , the label transfer results demonstrate that scTGCN is an effective and scalable tool for analyzing large single-cell datasets , meanwhile providing valuable insights into complex biological system at the single-cell level . Despite scTGCN methods current focus on integration scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq , the generative distributions can also be adapted to include other types of omics layers , such as protein abundance , histone modification and methylation data . Firstly , scTGCN explore the idea of MK-MMD-based adaption for learning transferable features in graph convolutional network , which co-train labeled scRNA-seq and unlabeled scATAC-seq into a semisupervised paradigm efficiently . Our method is achieved by combining omics-specific autoencoders ( Fig 1c ) with graph convolutional networks and transfer learning , which allows for the integration of different types of omics data that have different distribution . However , with the exponential growth of sigle-cell data , there is an urgent need to leverage existing well-characterized datasets as source to ensure relaiable and consistent annotations of target data . Secondly , scTGCN nonlinearly propagates feature information from neighboring cells in the hybrid graph at every layer , which enables it learn the topological cell relationships and consider higher-order relations between cells . Compared to other methods , scTGCN has been shown to achieve higher accuracy in label transfer and can generate visualizations that remove technical noise while retainging the biologically relevant information . Meanwhile , the deep

[ABSTRACT] Our results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs , which , despite lacking a single consensus sequence , retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen . Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 ( AF3 ) modeling , we demonstrate that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin . NLSs are generally short motifs rich in basic amino acids ; however , identifying NLSs can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence . Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3 , resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth . In this study , we characterized the sequence specificity of an essential and conserved NLS in Mcm3 , a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase . Proteins with nuclear localization sequences ( NLSs ) are directed into the cell nucleus through interactions between the NLS and importin proteins .
[INTRODUCTION] Structural studies have provided substantial insights into the interaction between NLSs and importin alpha , revealing that this binding involves both hydrophobic and charge-charge interactions , with multiple basic residues in the NLS contacting negatively charged residues on importin alpha [ 4 , 15-18 ] . Further characterization of Mcm3 's NLS will not only help elucidate its cell cycle dependent nuclear import and subsequent loading , but also refine predictions of other putative NLSs that may exist in many nuclear proteins . Third , fluorescence microscopy of a GFP-tagged , shorter fragment of Mcm3766-772 resulted in a modest nuclear localization signal in live cells , suggesting that the flanking sequences of this Mcm3 NLS are needed for optimal NLS activity . This is supported through genetic studies , which illustrate that mutating Lys-128 in the SV40 NLS to non-basic residues significantly impaired nuclear import , whereas mutating it to arginine disrupts nuclear import without affecting viral replication . In contrast , mutation of a nearby basic residue in the SV40 NLS ( Lys-131 ) to methionine did not significantly affect nuclear import , suggesting that specific basic residues within the SV40 NLS may play distinct roles in controlling nuclear import . Both monopartite and bipartite NLSs function by interacting with proteins in the importin family , which are key transport receptors that recognize and guide NLS-containing proteins through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus . Since the nuclear import of Mcm3 and its subsequent chromatin loading are essential for cell growth , we performed mutagenesis studies to identify specific basic residues within Mcm3 's NLS that are
[RESULTS] Sequence alignment of this fragment across various species revealed that Mcm3764-771 , a shorter and flexible region within Mcm3 that is not visible in the published MCM double hexamer structures , is well-conserved in fungi ( Fig 1A ) [ 23 , 25-30 ] . This is further supported by the finding that the amount of chromatin-bound MCM in G1 cells is reduced by the partial inactivation of Cdc6 ( Fig 5B , with S5A Fig confirming cell cycle arrest ) , validating that this approach specifically detects loaded MCM complexes . To
[DISCUSSION] For example , similar to other mcm3 mutants with severe growth defects , the contacts mediated by basic residues at P2 and P3 of Mcm3K768R and Mcm3R769A deviate from those of wild-type Mcm3 ( Figs 6C and S7B ) , yet they only show partial growth defects ( Fig 1C ) . An unexpected finding from our study is that the Mcm3SV40-NLS-allR mutant fails to support nuclear import of Mcm3 ( Figs 3 and 4 ) , despite AF3 predicting similar contacts with Kap60 at P2 and P3 ( S7 Fig ) . In contrast , P4 is often occupied by a non-basic residue in monopartite NLSs ; structural studies of the SV40 and c-Myc NLSs suggest that P4 does not interact specifically with importin alpha , thus P4 may be less critical for nuclear import . This study provides additional support of the importance of K767 and K768 in Mcm3 , which are critical for both its nuclear import through interaction with Kap60 and loading onto chromatin through modification by SUMO . Thus , further biophysical studies , including measurements of binding affinity between Mcm3 's NLS and Kap60 , are needed to characterize various mcm3 mutations and gain a deeper understanding of their effects on nuclear import . The existence of Rad52-dependent survivors suggests that an unknown gain-of-function effect caused by these mcm3 mutants may have induced double-stranded DNA breaks in the mcm3 plasmids . Moreover , we have previously

[ABSTRACT] Results of Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing ( TRIBE ) , co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that a polyA-binding protein ( PABP ) interacting , PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 may be a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules . Taken together , the data lead to a proposal for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation as well as to neurodegeneration . Experiments with transgenic Drosophila indicate that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration , structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both support Atx2-induced cytotoxicity . ATXN2 ( or Atx2 in insects ) can function in translational activation , translational repression , mRNA stability and in the assembly of mRNP-granules , a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) . Previous work has shown that the LSm ( Like-Sm ) domain of Atx2 , which can help stimulate mRNA translation , antagonizes mRNP-granule assembly . Ataxin-2 ( ATXN2 ) is a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II ( SCA2 ) , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and Parkinsonism . Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins . The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions .
[INTRODUCTION] This , and studies showing that inhibitors of eIF2α kinase or downstream events including SG formation can be protective in animal models of neurodegenerative disease [ 56-60 ] have led to a conceptual framework in which : ( a ) mRNP granules provide a microenvironment where pathogenic protein seeds can form and grow ; ( b ) increased misfolded protein loads result in inclusion formation , chronic stress signalling and reduced protein translation ; ( c ) increased demand on protein handling systems results in multiple cellular defects , notably in the functions of membrane-less organelles [ 65-69 ] . For this reason , and because TDP-43 and other stress-granule protein aggregates are components of protein inclusions found in ALS and Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) , the regulation and cellular functions of SGs have been topics of considerable fundamental and clinical interest [ 20-26 ] . An important observation is that most IDRs also can transition from liquid-like state into solid , beta-sheet rich , amyloid-fibrils in vitro , particularly at high concentrations achieved in the liquid phase [ 22 , 41 , 53-55 ] . A recent discovery that the Atx2-LSm domain antagonizes IDR-function has led to a model in which the Atx2 cIDR : ( a ) does not support mRNP assembly when Atx2 is associated with actively translating mRNAs through Atx2-LSm domain interactions ; ( b ) becomes accessible and active in mediating mRNP assembly when LSm-domain interactions break and mRNA translation stalls . We propose an early role for PAM2 : PABP
[RESULTS] Strikingly , flies expressing the Atx2ΔPAM2 variant , which formed compositionally distinct granules in S2 cells , showed no significant decline in climbing ability , suggesting that Atx2 's ability to promote progressive decline of neural function depends less on Atx2 granule formation and aggregation , and a bit more on its sequestration of critical translation factors such as PABP ( and associated RNAs ( Fig 5B ) . In unstressed cells , PAM2 domain interaction with PABP helps position Ataxin-2 at the 3'-end of mRNAs while LSM-domain mediated
[DISCUSSION] Despite the high conservation of the structured domains of Ataxin-2 between human and Drosophila , our data shows that human ATXN2 does not form distinct granules in S2 cells and that this outcome is not dependent on the evolutionary divergence of the structured domains ( panels A-B of V Fig in S1 File ) . The importance of the PAM2 domain in promoting degeneration has been previously observed by experiments showing that heterologous expression of a pathogenic form of human Ataxin-2 lacking its PAM2 domain , but not the full-length form , suppresses cytotoxicity in Drosophila expressing human TDP-43 . The additional observation that Atx2ΔPAM2-ADARcd expression results in a large number of non-native mRNA edits , indicates that the PAM2 : PABP interaction not only selects correct target mRNAs but also prevents Ataxin-2 engagement with incorrect mRNA target regions . This logical sequence of events is consistent with : ( a ) TRIBE data showing a reduced number of edits of native Ataxin-2 target mRNAs by Atx2ΔPAM2-ADARcd ; ( b ) the inability of mini-Atx2ΔPAM2 constructs to associate with SGs ; and ( c ) the aberrant protein composition of granules induced by Atx2ΔPAM2 in S2 cells . Thus , we suggest that in the case of actively translating mRNAs , the Atx2 function is driven by LSm-domain association with LSM12 and translational initiators , and that LSM12 disengages from a translational

[ABSTRACT] We showed that this gene becomes progressively dispensable for specification and maintenance of the muscle stem ( MuSC ) cell pool in extraocular muscles ( EOMs ) despite being , together with Myf5 , a major upstream regulator during early development . We demonstrate also that MuSCs in the EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier that those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult , yet EOMs have a significantly higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and post-natally . Overall , our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and brings further insights into the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy . Finally , while limb MuSCs proliferate in the mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy , significantly less MuSCs were present in the EOMs of the mdx mouse model compared to controls , and they were not proliferative . Despite recent efforts , a clear understanding of the cascade of events underlying the emergence and maintenance of the stem cell pool in specific muscle groups remains unresolved and debated . Gene regulatory networks that act upstream of skeletal muscle fate determinants are distinct in different anatomical locations . Moreover , constitutive inactivation of Pax7 postnatally led to a greater loss of MuSCs in the EOMs compared to the limb . Here , we invalidated Pitx2 with multiple Cre-driver mice prenatally , postnatally , and during lineage progression . Thus , we propose a relay between Pitx2 , Myf5 and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance .
[INTRODUCTION] Instead , Pitx2 ( Paired Like Homeodomain 2 ) , which is also expressed in head muscles , plays a critical role as an upstream regulator of EOM development , as these muscles are lost in Pitx2 null mice , with phenotypes being dependent on the gene dosage and timing of deletion . Yet , as no MuSC lineage-specific deletion of Pitx2 has been performed in EOMs , it is unclear : i ) to what extent Pitx2 is required temporally for emergence and maintenance of the MuSC population , and its relative function compared to the MRFs and Pax7 ; ii ) if Pitx2 is continuously required for maintenance of the adult MuSC population . Understanding the physiological mechanisms controlling the development of different muscle groups , and how they are selectively deregulated or spared during disease and ageing , is crucial for devising therapeutic strategies for a wide range of myopathies . Our study provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of myogenesis from embryonic to postnatal stages in vivo and identifies differential cycling states , dynamics of commitment , and establishment of MuSC quiescence in EOMs compared to limb muscles . This population of stem cells emerges in an asynchronous manner in different anatomical locations , and it exhibits an unusual diversity in developmental origins and genetic regulation depending on the muscle group in which it resides [ 1-3 ] . As high levels of Pitx2 are retained in dystrophic and ageing mouse EOMs and overexpression of Pitx2 was
[RESULTS] Evaluation of the expression of Calcitonin receptor ( CalcR ) , which is a marker of postnatal quiescent MuSCs , showed that > 90 % of GFP+ cells in the Pax7 heterozygous were positive for this marker at P20 as expected , whereas all GFP+ cells in the Pax7 KO were CalcR-negative in both TA and EOMs , suggesting that in both muscles this residual GFP+ population is perturbed ( Fig 2G-2I ) . Notably , in stark contrast to the Myf5Cre data , similar numbers of
[DISCUSSION] Collectively , these observations indicate that EOM specification and differentiation has evolved a unique gene regulatory network where EOM progenitor survival as well as activation of the downstream myogenic factors are dependent on either Myf5 or Mrf4 , and that Pitx2 alone can not override their role . The phenotypes of Pax7 null cells during in vitro activation were somewhat more divergent , depending on the system used ( isolated myoblasts , myofibres , clonogenic assays ) including reduction in the number of myoblasts , increased or reduced differentiation and/or commitment to alternative fates [ 35-38 , 40 , 41 ] . Second , no differences in the number of GFP+ cells per area nor in the proportion of Pitx2+GFP+ cells were observed in the foetal period between control and mutant EOMs , suggesting that factors other than Pitx2 ( and Pax3 ) may ensure the specification of this cell population during embryonic development . While the origin of the discordance with lineage tracing studies is unclear , one possibility could be that MuSCs in the EOMs contribute to myofibres without cell cycle entry and/or the genetic constructs used as Cre drivers are unexpectedly expressed in these myofibres . Finally , some insights into the potential role of Pitx2 in the sparing of EOMs in DMD come from a study showing that in the absence of

[ABSTRACT] With the ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) and its increasing adaptation to humans , several variants of concern ( VOCs ) and variants of interest ( VOIs ) have been identified since late 2020 . In our experiments , we found that this algorithm can accurately fit the reported data of the British Columbia ( BC ) province and its five internal health agencies in Canada . We combine the proposed epidemic model and reported infected data of variants with physical information neural networks ( PINNs ) to develop a novel mechanism called VOCs-informed neural network ( VOCs-INN ) . In this study , we propose an SI1…InR infectious disease model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among the human population . Furthermore , it can simulate observed or unobserved dynamics , infer time-dependent parameters , and enable short-term predictions . These variants may show distinct levels of virulence , antigenicity , and infectivity , which require specific defense and control measures . VOCs-INN performs well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data . The experimental results also reveal variations in the intensity of control strategies implemented across these regions . These include Alpha , Beta , Gamma , Delta , Omicron parent lineage , and other variants .
[INTRODUCTION] These studies demonstrate that the use of PINNs can estimate time-varying parameters within compartmental models with accuracy and offer a fresh perspective on understanding epidemic spread mechanisms , providing useful insights for the development of effective prevention and control strategies . assessed predictive models including LSTM , Bi-LSTM , Generalized Regression Neural Network ( GRU ) , and Dense-LSTM for predicting the trend of confirmed cases , deaths , and recoveries in the time series data of twelve major countries impacted by COVID-19 . These methods primarily depend on mathematical models and statistical principles , along with the analysis of actual epidemiological data , such as the least squares method , the Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) approach , and the iterative filtering method . compared predictive models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average ( ARIMA ) , Support Vector Regression ( SVR ) , LSTM , and Bi-directional LSTM ( Bi-LSTM ) to forecast confirmed cases , deaths , and recoveries in ten major countries affected by COVID-19 . In this study , we introduced a new VOCs-INN algorithm , which integrates epidemiological data , deep learning , and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission intensity of various COVID-19 strains during the pandemic . Although these models exhibit good data fitting and short-term prediction abilities , their failure to account for epidemiological transmission mechanisms complicates the accurate interpretation of disease spread patterns . Therefore , it can be difficult to accurately estimate how these parameters change over time and capture the complex dynamics of infectious diseases in
[RESULTS] By comparing the predictions with the unused data from the fitting process in Figs 8 and 9 , we observe that the time-dependent SI1I2R model calibrated by the VOCs-INN algorithm predicts the trend of future outbreaks quite well , with the shaded areas differing by a small number of people from the real data . We assign the transmission rates and removal rates for the subsequent 16 weeks to the values inferred by the VOCs-INN algorithm at the final time point , as illustrated in Supporting information ( For the
[DISCUSSION] Firstly , during this period , governments took several intervention measures , such as promoting vaccination , enforcing mandatory mask-wearing in hospitals in April , and lifting the compulsory vaccination requirement for health personnel in July [ 38-42 ] . As we continue to neural network into the potential uses of VOCs-INN in infectious disease modeling , we aim to integrate it with other advanced machine-learning methods to better fit and predict infectious disease data . In our research , we sought to address the complexities of understanding and modeling the transmission dynamics of Variants of Concern ( VOCs ) by integrating an SI1…InR model with neural networks . The flexibility of VOCs-INN allows it to be adapted to various epidemiological scenarios and datasets , offering a robust tool for addressing the complexities and uncertainties associated with epidemic challenges . Furthermore , while the fixed parameters in the model can be adapted as time-varying parameters using VOCs-INN , this method necessitates a larger and more complex parameter network . In conclusion , the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks ( PINNs ) with infectious disease models , particularly through the proposed VOCs-INN approach , represents a significant research contribution . However , it is worth noting that this improvement is not linear , excessively large numbers of interpolation points can lead to increased computational time and complexity .

[ABSTRACT] CytoSummaryNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance learning framework , providing an easier-to-apply method for aggregating single-cell feature data than previously published strategies . We introduce CytoSummaryNet : a Deep Sets-based approach that improves mechanism of action prediction by 30-68 % in mean average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset . Interpretability analysis suggests that the model achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells . Image-based cell profiling is a powerful tool that compares perturbed cell populations by measuring thousands of single-cell features and summarizing them into profiles . CytoSummaryNet offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets . Typically a sample is represented by averaging across cells , but this fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations . The approach requires only perturbation labels for training , which are readily available in all cell profiling datasets .
[INTRODUCTION] Despite its current limitations , so-called population-averaged profiling , where all single-cell features are averaged per feature using either the mean or the median , remains the most commonly-used approach in the field of image-based profiling . Here , we introduce a novel method that addresses both of these limitations and automatically finds an effective way to aggregate single-cell data to improve the information content of sample profiles . This method provided ~20 % better performance predicting a compound 's mechanism of action and a gene 's pathway , showing that capturing statistics related to cell population heterogeneity can improve performance on downstream tasks . Second , because it produces a similarity matrix rather than an embedding , it requires recomputing the pairwise similarities among all profiles each time a new profile is included in the dataset . Among other applications , image-based profiling has already been used to predict assay outcomes for compounds [ 2-4 ] , detect leukemia label-free , and predict the impact of particular gene mutations . The most straightforward solution is to incorporate the cell population 's dispersion ( e. g. , standard deviation ) for each extracted feature and concatenate these values with the average-aggregated profile . It dramatically decreases the data size ( as there are typically thousands of cells per well , hundreds of wells per plate , and multiple plates per experiment ) and simplifies downstream analysis . Average profiling is a simple way of summarizing a cell population ( hereafter referred to as a sample ) into a vector ( a sample 's profile ) with only one value per measured
[RESULTS] We performed this analysis on the cpg0001 dataset from the public Cell Painting Gallery , which consists of 384-well plates with identical sample layouts of 90 unique compounds , i. e. , there is a single `` plate layout '' for the entire dataset ( See Experimental Setup : Data ) ; each plate contains four replicates of each compound in different well positions , plus 24 negative controls . While cross-validation on the 10 μM dose could also be informative , focusing on lower dose points offers a more challenging test of the
[DISCUSSION] These findings are consistent with recent studies that emphasize the importance of considering cell context when analyzing phenotypic variance and genetic interactions , supporting the notion that focusing on large , uncrowded cells can provide more accurate and informative data for understanding the effects of perturbations on cell populations . On the other hand , the least salient cells appear to be smaller , more crowded , and tend to contain spots of high-intensity pixels , which may indicate that they are dying , debris , or in some stage of cell division . For mechanism of action retrieval on the primary dataset , CytoSummaryNet achieves 36 % to 60 % better performance than average profiling on hold-out plates created with different experimental protocols than the training plates , provided that these hold-out plates are from the same stain set ( e. g. , Stain2 , Stain3 , etc . Still , not all compounds with the same mechanism of action cluster well , due to factors such as multiple annotated mechanisms , unannotated off-target effects , suboptimal cell type or dose , and technical artifacts . The architecture of CytoSummaryNet holds significant potential for broader applications beyond image-based cell profiling , accommodating tabular , permutation-invariant data and enhancing downstream task performance when applied to processed population-level profiles . These results improve upon the ~20 % gains previously observed using covariance features albeit on a different dataset , and importantly , CytoSummaryNet effectively overcomes

[ABSTRACT] To validate the effectiveness of this framework , we apply it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task , a cognitive test in which participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another , often conflicting , aspect . Altered flexibility in these dynamics can lead to impaired cognitive performance , manifesting for instance as difficulties in attention regulation , distraction inhibition , and behavioral adaptation . The ability to solve complex tasks relies on the adaptive changes occurring in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions . Therefore , developing quantitative measures that can directly assess the effort involved in these transitions using neural data is of paramount importance . By utilizing a fully data-driven method , this research opens up fresh perspectives for physiologically describing cognitive effort within the brain . Our findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive effort , thus confirming the framework 's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions . In this study , we propose a framework to associate cognitive effort during the performance of tasks with electroencephalography ( EEG ) activation patterns . The Stroop task is a cognitive test where participants must respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another , often conflicting , aspect . The methodology relies on the identification of discrete dynamical states ( EEG microstates ) and optimal transport theory . Such impairments result in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks .
[INTRODUCTION] This interference effect , referred to as the `` Stroop effect '' , is believed to reflect the difficulty in suppressing the automatic processing of the spatial location of the stimulus in favor of the task-relevant information ( the arrow direction ) , with the consequent activation of a wrong response code that then needs to be suppressed . More specifically , given an initial and a target probability distribution , representing , for instance , the distribution of metastable substates during resting and task conditions , the Schrödinger bridge problem asks for the most likely path or `` bridge '' that connects the two probability distributions given the spontaneous ( resting ) stochastic dynamics of the system . Recently , it has been shown that such functional networks may reflect the long-time average of rapidly switching metastable patterns ( also called `` metastable substates '' or `` dynamical states '' ) , which are consistently observed with different imaging methods [ 3-7 ] . In its spatial variant [ 42-44 ] , participants are typically presented with arrows pointing in different directions ( e. g. , top left or bottom right ) and are asked to indicate the direction of the arrow through a spatially compatible button press . Additionally , the reliability of individual differences in task-based fMRI activity is known to be quite poor , especially in the absence of long time series , as typically occurs in fMRI data , thus hindering the possibility of a subject-level analysis . The
[RESULTS] To examine the potential relationship between transition costs and task performance of each participant , we performed a linear mixed effects model on the computed costs including response times as predictors after having calculated the difference in costs and response times between incongruent and congruent conditions ( i. e. , the Stroop effects ) , considering each level of control ( see `` Statistical Analysis '' section ; see also Figs 4B and S2 ) . These interaction effects were explained by the fact that the expression of
[DISCUSSION] This suggests that while KL divergence is a useful measure for capturing global shifts between task and resting states , it may lack the sensitivity required to detect more nuanced effects related to cognitive cost when compared to the Schrödinger bridge method . However , this interpretation is in contrast with existing literature , since microstate A is commonly attributed to resting condition , but it should be noted that we used an eyes-open resting state , which likely reduced the power in the alpha band . Therefore , investigating individual differences in microstate transition cost in different groups ( e. g. , strokes ) , or applying it to tasks where the evaluation of cognitive demands is not known , are all interesting avenues to pursue in future research . Although individual topographies have been associated with partial activations or deactivations of canonical resting-state networks and specific spectral bands , the functional and cognitive role of the microstates has not yet been fully established . It is important to mention that in a stochastic linear setting , the Schrödinger bridge control cost is formally equivalent to the `` classical '' control cost ( i. e. , the expectation of the time integral of squared control signal ) , which has a clear physical interpretation . This would involve investigating changes during tasks and determining if the control
[METHODS] To this aim , EEG signals were recorded from 44 participants during a 4-min resting state session and while they performed a spatial Stroop task requiring mouse responses and comprising blocks with three PC values ( 25 % , 50 % , and 75 % ) to manipulate different levels of cognitive control engagement ( Fig 1A ; see for details about the",,989,98,None,"The ability to solve complex tasks relies on the adaptive changes occurring in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions .

[ABSTRACT] Here , P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein II ( PvDBPII ) probes were generated to detect the development and durability of specific aMBCs , and to demonstrate the capacity of these cells to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections . To address biology and function of P. vivax-specific aMBCs in producing protective antibodies , a single MBC was cultured , and the secreted IgG was tested for binding and inhibition activity . Notably , B cell receptors ( BCRs ) of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs expressed unique IGHV genes , with similar usage of IGHV1-3 , comparable to classical MBCs . The aMBC-derived clones produced antibodies with variable levels of anti-PvDBPII IgG in cultures , and some produced high antibody levels comparable to classical MBC clones . The somatic hypermutation ( SHM ) rate and CDR3 length of VH and Vκ in these two MBC subsets were not significantly different . The accumulation of aMBCs during and following infections might play an important role in producing protective antibodies against malaria . To date , the generation of P. vivax-specific aMBCs and their function in protective humoral immune responses is unknown . PvDBPII-specific aMBCs were elicited during malaria illness , and they persisted through the recovery phase of infections . Among the aMBC clones , A1F12 and B4E11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBPII variants . Together , our findings revealed that P. vivax infections elicited the development and persistence of P. vivax-specific aMBCs . Thus , we focused our attention on the function of aMBCs in producing neutralizing antibodies . Expansion of atypical memory B cells ( aMBCs ) was demonstrated in malaria-exposed individuals .
[INTRODUCTION] The leading vaccine candidate , PvDBPII was taken to generate tetramer probes to detect antigen-specific aMBCs during the acute and recovery phases of infections , demonstrated the capability of aMBCs to produce neutralizing antibodies , and assessed the potential inhibitory activity of aMBC-derived IgG and human monoclonal antibodies ( HuMoAbs ) in inhibition of erythrocyte binding by a panel of PvDBPII allelic variants . The function and longevity of anti-malarial antibodies are highly variable , with some individuals acquiring long-term protection following a limited number of exposures , whereas others may require repeated exposures to generate such protective immunity . Among blood stage antigens , the P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein region II ( DBPII ) is the central molecule necessary for the invasion of reticulocytes through its ability to bind Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines ( DARC ) on the reticulocyte surface . Given the rapid spread of drug-resistant parasite strains and the formation of hypnozoites in the liver with potential to cause relapse and the diversity of antigens , a highly effective vaccine to prevent the disease is essential . This observation has led to the hypothesis that the slow and imperfect acquisition of humoral immunity to malaria is associated with impaired development of MBCs or antibody secreting cells ( ASCs ) . The genetic polymorphism within this protein is known to alter its antigenic character with induction of short-lived and allele-specific naturally acquired anti-DBPII antibodies . Our generation of fluorochrome-labeled P. vivax antigens , along
[RESULTS] The results showed that secreted IgG antibodies from both aMBCs ( A1F12 , A3F12 , B4E06 ) and classical ( B4E11 , B4F09 , B4F10 ) MBCs strongly inhibited ( ≥ 80 % ) PvDBPII-erythrocyte binding while antibodies from the B4H09 aMBC and B4E09 classical MBC clones showed less inhibition ( Fig 4A and 4B ) . The A1F12 and B4E11 antibodies showed no significant differences in inhibitory activity against the variant strains ( Fig 5B ) , indicating that the conserved epitopes shared among tested
[DISCUSSION] Lastly , larger sample size for aMBC characterization and its ability in ASC differentiation for neutralizing antibody production , as well as V ( D ) J gene analysis , would better capture the variability of V ( D ) J gene rearrangements and their functional roles in the context of aMBC responses to P. vivax malaria . Fourth , we were unable to assess a possible association between the frequency of P. vivax-specific aMBCs and a subject 's number of infections , as only very few of our subjects had a history of prior infection based on records at malaria clinics . In our study , unique IGHV ( IGHV 3-21 and IGHV5-51 ) and IGKV gene usages ( IGKV2D-29 and IGKV2-29 ) were observed in aMBCs encoding anti-P. vivax neutralizing antibodies ( B4E06 and A1F12 ) , indicating that these aMBC clones were derived from different precursors . In addition to their role as precursors of ASCs , as shown in previous studies and ours , aMBCs have capacity to present antigens by internalizing membrane-associated antigens and express MHC class II and CD11c molecules to interact with T cells . The number of bulk aMBCs ( not antigen-specific ) was high in Malian adults and children with chronic asymptomatic P. falciparum infections , compared to uninfected children , suggesting that the long-term

[ABSTRACT] We also present a real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank , showing that mr. mash-rss achieves higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits , especially when the data set has smaller sample size . Through simulations , we show that mr. mash-rss is competitive with , and often outperforms , current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in a variety of scenarios that differ in the pattern of effect sharing across phenotypes , the number of phenotypes , the number of causal variants , and the genomic heritability . In this work , we introduce mr. mash-rss , an extension of the mr. mash model that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) and linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) estimates from a reference panel . By using summary data , we achieve the twin goal of increasing the applicability of the mr. mash model to data sets that are not publicly available and making it scalable to biobank-size data . Recently , mr. mash , a flexible and computationally efficient method that models multiple phenotypes jointly and leverages sharing of effects across such phenotypes to improve prediction accuracy , was introduced . However , a drawback of mr. mash is that it requires individual-level data , which are often not publicly available . Polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes has become important in human genetics , especially in the context of precision medicine .
[INTRODUCTION] However , while mash assumes that the input summary statistics come from independent variables ( i. e. , it does not deal with LD ) , mr. mash-rss takes a full multivariate multiple regression approach and adjusts effect sizes for both sharing across conditions and correlations among variables ( i. e. , it takes LD into account ) . mr. mash-rss shares some features with the established Multivariate Adaptive Shrinkage ( mash ) , in that they both use the same mixture-of-multivariate-Normals prior on the effect sizes to leverage effect sharing across conditions ( e. g. , different phenotypes ) , and the EB approach to adapt the prior to the data . Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to multiple regression have been developed for and/or applied to this task , with accuracy spanning from very low to high depending on the genetic architecture of the trait analyzed [ 7-12 ] . We test mr. mash-rss in the task of PGS prediction for multiple phenotypes jointly via simulations in several scenarios and show that it is competitive in terms of prediction accuracy with currently available methods . These are effect sizes and their standard errors ( or Z-scores ) from univariate Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWASs ) and Linkage Disequilibrium ( LD ) estimates from reference panels , which are usually publicly available . In that case , modeling these phenotypes jointly via multivariate multiple regression methods can improve effect sizes estimates by leveraging effect sharing and , thus , increase prediction accuracy [ 13-17 ] . Using multi-tissue gene expression prediction from cis-genotypes as an example ,
[DISCUSSION] One way to test the robustness of mr. mash-rss to different sources of model misspecification would be to use truly external summary statistics , possibly from a meta-analysis , and evaluate its performance in an independent cohort . While the theory behind the method assumes the phenotypes to be continuous , it may be possible for mr. mash-rss to be applied to case-control phenotypes , in the same way as methods such LDpred2-auto and SBayesR , which also assume continuous phenotypes . Through an array of simulations and real data analysis using the UK Biobank , we showed that mr. mash-rss is competitive with state-of-the-art univariate and multivariate PGS methods . In addition , in specific cases such as with complete sample non-overlap across phenotypes , some simplifications arise that allow for models like mr. mash-rss to be fitted efficiently . This issue can be overcome by using a grid search and cross-validation approach to select the combination of mixture weights that maximizes prediction accuracy in a test set . Future research is needed to find a more principled way to select hyperparameters that works well with arbitrary patterns of sparsity in the genetic architecture of complex traits . This holds good promise for improving prediction accuracy for phenotypes that are difficult to measure and in samples of individuals of non-European descent , which are usually much smaller . Of note , mr. mash-rss outperformed competing methods in 14 out of
[METHODS] Thus , the mr. mash model can be fitted using expressions based only on these sufficient statistics ( see S1 Text for detailed derivations ) to obtain the same results as using individual-level data X and Y . However , it should be noted that while X⊺Y can be recovered exactly , X⊺X is only approximated when LD estimates come from reference panels , rather than",,884,93,None,"In this work , we introduce mr . mash-rss , an extension of the aforementioned model that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies and linkage disequilibrium estimates from a reference panel .

[ABSTRACT] In this study , we propose a novel modelling framework integrating the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models , by introducing a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles . Subsequently , we project the attack rate and peak of new infections for the first Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the dynamic zero-COVID policy . Accurate prediction of epidemics is pivotal for making well-informed decisions for the control of infectious diseases , but addressing heterogeneity in the system poses a challenge . Data from a COVID Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the UDE model using deep learning methods and to calibrate the mechanistic model using MCMC methods . We consider that this study lays the groundwork for the development of a new class of models and new insights for modelling heterogeneity . 36 % of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from ~30 days to ~70 days , also aligning with the real case . Simultaneously , we pre-set a specific form for the recruitment rate and develop a mechanistic model . A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations ( UDE ) model . Our simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in the susceptibles decreases herd immunity for ~37 . Our projections indicate an attack rate and a peak of new infections of 80 . 17 % of the population , respectively , compared with the homogeneous model 's projections of 99 . 6 % improvement in the prediction accuracy based on the actual data . 78 % , thus providing an 18 . 97 % and 32 . 06 % and 3 .
[INTRODUCTION] However , regardless of the transmission mechanism , the simplest SIR model structure assumes that all susceptibles are equally likely to be infected by infectious individuals , even though many of them may not have the opportunity to come into contact with an infectious individual simultaneously due to a heterogeneous contact structure or spatial processes . For this reason , homogeneous compartment models are frequently used in scenario analysis to predict the epidemic trends of emerging infectious diseases due to the huge advantages of this modelling framework , given the aspects of parameterization , interpretability , ease of calibration , computational efficiency and strong predictive capabilities . Therefore , exploring novel approaches that explicitly integrate spatial heterogeneity within homogeneous compartmental modelling frameworks to add new insights for modelling heterogeneity , particularly for precise ( by involving heterogeneity ) and efficient ( by leveraging the advantages of homogeneous model framework ) prediction of epidemics , is the scope of this study . Subsequently , we apply our proposed model to project the epidemic trends of various COVID-19 variants as case studies , conducting tests and evaluations to compare prediction accuracy with traditional homogeneous modelling frameworks . Therefore , when considering the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptibles , the actual susceptible population in homogeneous models should consist of individuals actively involved in the transmission process-those with an approximately equal probability of encountering infectious individuals . Over the past few decades , emerging infectious diseases , such as SARS , influenza A
[RESULTS] Notably , from the announcement of major changes of control policy on 7 December 2022 to 23 January 2023 ( the end of the epidemic wave ) , the first large-scale epidemic wave in China after the easing of the dynamic zero-COVID policies actually persisted for 77 days , which is also consistent with our projection . The report highlighted that the positive rate of infections detected by nucleic acid tests peaked on 22 December 2022 , and by 23 January 2023 , it had decreased
[DISCUSSION] Secondly , there is also another kind of heterogeneity ( such as the age-structure of the population ) which is ignored in the current study and how the different forms of heterogeneity reciprocally affect the transmission dynamics of infectious disease would be a very interesting issue . The straightforward approach taken in our framework not only enhances its practical utility but also encourages further exploration and refinement , thereby contributing to the advancement of understanding and modelling infectious disease dynamics with spatio-temporal heterogeneity . Firstly , we only used one time-series of the epidemic data to train or calibrate the models , hence we appeal for the collection of more spatial data for calibrating our models , which would definitely help to increase the robustness of the results . This phenomenon also suggests the possibility that the diffusion of infections may lead to multiple instances of herd immunity , as the increased recruitment rate can cause the effective reproduction number to rise and exceed the threshold again . Finally , when we tried to generate the time series of the numbers of daily new infections , the frequency distribution of the time-interval from infection to report seems , potentially , to be bimodal , while our pre-set distributions were not bimodal . However , their utility in conducting quantitative analyses of epidemic outbreaks
[METHODS] We then set p as the probability of the contacts happening outside their epicentre , hence , there are in total pcI ( t ) contacts outside the epicentre at time t. Similar to the standard incidence rate , contacts should also happen between infectious individuals I ( t ) and the reserved susceptible population Sr ( t ) for successfully",,953,96,None,"In this study , we propose a novel modelling framework integrating spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models , by introducing a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles .

[ABSTRACT] Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its postsynaptic neuron , we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment . To show this , we developed a mathematical framework , in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain , dynamic environment . This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is being updated by a synaptic learning rule , which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms . In addition , this approach entails that a synapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential . Here we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron . Hereby , synapses coordinate themselves to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations . Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising . Synapses in the brain are highly noisy , which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability .
[INTRODUCTION] In contrast to previous approaches ( e. g. , ) that used PP to understand the influence of neuromodulatory signals such as Dopamine on synaptic plasticity , we focus here on a PP perspective of synaptic plasticity , unraveling the dynamics of a single synapse governed by only locally accessible quantities such as the pre- and postsynaptic-spike times and the current value of the synaptic efficacy . Predictive processing has emerged as a powerful normative theory to derive biologically plausible rules for synaptic plasticity from first principles , and a number of previous studies have explored this , e. g. , to address the role of neural compartmentalization , cortical mocrocircuits , and dendritic trees for few short learning . In other words , as we show here , the task of a synapse to learn suitable synaptic responses can be considered as a problem of behaving in a partially unknown environment , where the variability in synaptic release is being used to properly represent the uncertainty of the synapse about the cellular , environmental state . Predictive processing ( PP ) is based on the idea that biological systems instantiate an internal model of their environment that allows them to make predictions , take actions , and to minimize surprise [ 14-17 ] . We apply PP to individual synapses , arguing that the dynamics of a synapse can be considered as an agent interacting with its cellular environment , and derive a synaptic learning rule by minimizing the surprise in individual synapses . On the network level , our computer simulations indicate that SPP allows
[RESULTS] ( 2b ) Then we have to reduce the surprise Eq ( 7 ) by reducing the distance between the inferred posterior distribution p ( y | z ) and the actual distribution over PSCs q ( y|w ) used in the immediate response ( 1 ) to update the synaptic efficacy w. To solve the first sub-problem ( 2a ) we make use of the internal model p ( u | z ) to directly infer PSCs that are compatible with a given spiking behavior z . The learning rule can
[DISCUSSION] In summary , we have presented a synapse-centric account of PP that views synapses as agents that interact with their post-synaptic neuron much like an organism interacts with its environment . In contrast to this prior work , our model synapses use only local information and yields triplet STDP dynamics which can be directly tested against experiments . Our results complement previous applications of PP on the system and network level , and demonstrates that manifestations of PP can be identified even on the smallest scales of brain function . The emergent learning algorithm is fully event-based , i. e. , computation only takes place when pre- and post-synaptic spikes arrive at the synapses . The emerging SPP learning rule is qualitatively consistent with experimentally observed synaptic mechanisms while being analytically tractable . The model is therefore very well suited for event-based neural simulation and brain-inspired hardware .
[METHODS] We used the Euler method to approximate the solution of the stochastic differential equations with a fixed time step of 1 ms. Postsynaptic currents were created as described in Section 3 in S1 Appendix , where Dirac delta pulses were approximated by 1 ms rectangular unit pulses . In Section 8 in S1 Appendix we show in detail that the synaptic efficacy updates Eq ( 4",,867,92,None,"Synapses in the brain are highly noisy , which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability . Here we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of its postsynaptic neuron . In addition , we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapes in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control . Given how costly synapies are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising . We develop a mathematical framework , in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the post-spike neuron in similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain , dynamic environment . This framework entails that a sinapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatal potential ."

[INTRODUCTION] Monovar is an SNV caller designed specifically for scDNA-seq data ; for each position , it models the ADO with a Bernoulli distribution , the AEs with independent and identically distributed ( i. i. d. ) Bernoulli random variables and base-calling error probabilities depend on Phred quality scores , , while utilizing dynamic programming . There have been several methods explicitly made for scDNA-seq data , both for identifying mutations ( single nucleotide variant ( SNV ) callers ) and for reconstructing cell lineage trees , although several of them are targeting cancer data . More recently , the Phylovar method was shown to handle millions of loci and be faster than SCIΦ while having similar accuracy by taking advantage of the efficient vectorized computations . Unfortunately , the whole-genome amplification methods , such as the multiple displacement amplification ( MDA ) method and the multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles ( MALBAC ) method , introduce technical artifacts known as amplification errors ( AEs ) that are hard to distinguish from mutations . All these reconstruction methods exploit mutations and attempt to reconstruct trees in which the proximity between a pair of cells , or clones , is correlated with the similarity between their patterns of mutations . Therefore , mutations are scarce when reconstructing lineage trees for healthy tissues , implying that more sophisticated models and computational methods are needed to capitalize fully on the existing mutations . The somatic mutation rate in humans is 10−9 per locus per cell division , and the copy number is not considered to carry substantial information regarding cell lineage membership in healthy tissue . This scarcity also highlights
[RESULTS] Since the fibroblast dataset is so hard that a reconstruction method would at most identify the two main monophyletic groups correctly , we devised a test based on bootstrapping , using the transfer bootstrap expectation ( TBE ) edge supports . Following the software documentation , we extracted the sites picked by SCIΦ and created a new Mpileup file , which enabled us to run Phylovar on a cluster node . In the beige clone , Phylovar had high support for a sibling relation ( cells 12 and 13 ) , which was not supported by
[DISCUSSION] We will investigate how the extended model handles the challenges of single-cell tumor data and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods in our future work . In the potential future development of such methods where the domain moves toward the single-cell setting , Scuphr could provide a good set of bootstrap trees as input quickly . Scuphr is designed with the challenges of the scDNA-seq data in mind , it fits well with the biological findings , and in particular , it obtains better accuracy with leveraging read-phasing . We presented Scuphr , a probabilistic framework that reconstructs cell lineage trees from healthy , diploid single-cells using whole-genome amplified DNA sequencing data . In addition to the distance-based and MCMC-based methods , various variational inference based methods have recently been developed for tree reconstruction tasks [ 50-53 ] . These methods typically operate in the standard phylogeny setting and require a good set of initial trees for their analysis . However , it can be enhanced to handle cancer data by incorporating copy number variations into its model . Single-cell DNA sequencing technologies enable detailed analyses of development and cell differentiation [ 1-3 ] . Scuphr is designed for healthy , diploid scDNA-seq data .

[ABSTRACT] We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis ( LCOA ) achieved the largest health gain-∼8 % reduction in disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario-by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments . By mechanistically modelling-and calibrating to extensive , country-specific data-the incidence of disease , health-seeking behaviour , and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health available , we were able to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for the country . Unlike the LCOA-based HBP , this approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year- to-year basis , and a 5 % reduction in DALYs over the whole period , which suggests an approach based upon patient characteristics might prove beneficial in the future . In this work , we propose the individual-based Thanzi La Onse ( TLO ) model as a uniquely-tailored tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs while addressing these limitations . Efforts to achieve this are often framed through the lens of `` health benefits packages '' ( HBPs ) , which seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision . An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population-health outcomes given the available health system capacity . Analytic approaches widely used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process however have limitations . This HBP however incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation . Other feasible approaches to prioritisation were assessed , including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics , rather than service type .
[INTRODUCTION] Even in the case of current , country-specific CE estimates , the intrinsic nature of such context-dependent assumptions limits the ability of CE evidence-based analyses to consider predicted or hypothetical changes-for example , if seeking to evaluate an HBP strategy in conjunction with programmes aiming to remove financial barriers in access and uptake-hence severely restricting the range of scenarios these analyses can evaluate . The complex generative processes undertaken by stakeholders must address a wide range of concerns , both quantitative and qualitative in nature , which include ( but are not limited to ) burden of disease , cost-effectiveness ( CE ) , budget impact , cultural and political acceptability , financial risk protection , equity , and feasibility of implementation , all of which need to be considered in the context of health financing mechanisms . In particular , our analysis evaluates a limited set of possible HBPs to establish the relative reduction in the overall health burden that could be achieved through different prioritisation strategies , and to showcase how model-based analyses can offer an important insight into the factors that make individual HBPs particularly successful or unsuccessful in achieving this outcome . In addition , these analyses use CE estimates which necessarily include intrinsic assumptions about the probability of access and uptake and probability of service implementation , which happened to hold true for the country and period in which the data were collected ( although attempts have
[RESULTS] This is illustrated in Fig 4 , where we show how the total health burden is shaped by the evolution of the ten leading causes of DALYs-which alone account for ∼85 % of all DALYs incurred-for the benchmark case of the NP policy : while HIV/AIDS dominates by far the health burden incurred initially , this is overtaken by lower respiratory infections as the leading cause of DALYs by 2031 , with neonatal disorders closely following the same rising , demographically-led trend . This
[DISCUSSION] We have shown that the TLO simulation provides a unique tool with which to test HBPs designed specifically for Malawi , providing detailed evaluations on the health gains that can be achieved through the relative prioritisation of services given realistic constraints in available human resources for health while addressing limitations in other analytic methods commonly used to weigh evidence for different interventions . 4 ) which either reflect current preferences in the prioritisation of services among policy-makers and external funding agents ( RMNCH , VP , and CMD policies ) , mirror current analytical tools and approaches to prioritise health interventions ( HSSP-III HBP or LCOA ) , or implement new strategies of prioritisation based on patient characteristics rather than service type ( CV policy ) . Our TLO-based approach , however , further allows us to evaluate how the relative performance of the policies would change were health-seeking and clinical practices to be significantly improved , and hence assess how much the outcome of specific policies is limited not by the design of the policies themselves , but by other factors related to the practical application of those policies .

[ABSTRACT] Here , we employ Oligopaint DNA FISH to investigate mechanisms of meiotic homolog pairing and chromosome segregation in the holocentric pantry moth , Plodia interpunctella , and compare our findings to new and previous studies in the silkworm moth , Bombyx mori , which diverged from P. interpunctella over 100 million years ago . Surprisingly , in both species we find that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromosomes regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent . Our studies here highlight the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems , as employing novel organisms can lead to the discovery of novel biology . These findings challenge the classical view of segregation where paired , poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I . Yet , the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosomal events such as homolog pairing and chromosome segregation are not fully understood in many species . However , unlike the telomere-oriented chromosome segregation mechanism observed in Bombyx , Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple different ways at metaphase I . We find that pairing in both Bombyx and Plodia spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends . Despite this , we find clear end-on microtubule attachments and not lateral microtubule attachments co-orienting these separated kinetochores . Precise regulation of chromosome dynamics in the germline is essential for reproductive success across species . Additionally , sister kinetochores do not seem to be paired in these species . Additionally , both species form rod shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I . Instead , four distinct kinetochores are easily observed at metaphase I .
[INTRODUCTION] Three meiosis-specific mechanisms have been identified to date in holocentric species : 1 ) inverted meiosis , where sister chromatids are segregated before homologs and the holocentric structure is at least partially maintained [ 24-27 ] , 2 ) telokinetic ( or telokinetic-like ) meiosis , where telomeres or distal chromosome regions become kinetochore-recruitment sites , and 3 ) chromosome restructuring as seen in C. elegans , where telomeres face the spindle pole and kinetochore cups form around chromosomes [ 16 , 29-34 ] . In Caenorhabditis elegans , chromosome-specific sequences and their cis-acting binding partners form `` pairing centers '' at the distal regions of chromosomes ( arm-like regions ) that facilitate homolog recognition [ 10-14 ] , and chromosome segregation is mediated through a mechanism where telomeres face the spindle poles and kinetochore cups form around the chromosomes ( reviewed in ) . If recombination does occur and results in a cruciform-shaped bivalent ( a cross-shaped structure with long and short arms perpendicular to each other ) , having centromeres all along the length of the chromosome would mean centromeres face many different directions , which could lead to failed bi-orientation . For example , in both male and female meiosis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , centromeres and pericentric heterochromatin have been implicated in early meiotic pairing events at ( or even before ) meiotic entry [ 1-8 ] , and centromeres also mediate chromosome segregation at metaphase I ( reviewed in ) . While
[RESULTS] To test if this mechanism is conserved in Plodia , which diverged from Bombyx over 100 million years ago , we labeled one chromosome at a time using our stripe Oligopaints described above to quantify which chromosome region ( arms or center ) pairs first as cells progress through early meiotic prophase ( Fig 2A ) in early 5th instar larval testes . While somewhat surprising , this result agrees with recent data on kinetochore formation in Bombyx mori female meiosis , which showed kinetochore proteins
[DISCUSSION] The fact that we do not observe a strong correlation between chromosome length and center-oriented bivalents would , indeed , support a model where these center-oriented bivalents are not exclusively forming by double crossovers ( which we would expect to be more frequent for longer chromosomes ) . In this scenario , the telomere-oriented configuration would be a precursor to the center-oriented configuration , which is then achieved by the central kinetochore domains being pulled toward the poles via the meiotic spindle , flipping the homologs and resulting in a structure with both arm domains facing each other at the metaphase I plate . Since CENP-T shows low retention rates at chromosome regions with active gene expression in mitotic cells , we propose that active transcription at telomere-proximal regions in meiosis ( which may or may not facilitate homolog recognition ) could lead to the loss of CENP-T from the distal regions of chromosomes . While harboring unpaired sister kinetochores could increase the chances of aneuploidy , it may allow metaphase I bivalents to switch between homologs being bi-oriented or sisters being bi-oriented in a non-hybrid or hybrid situation , respectively , to maintain optimal fertility in different scenarios . While it seems most likely to us that the center-oriented bivalents observed at metaphase I represent the homologs being physically linked at both chromosome
[METHODS] Briefly , both genomic sequences were aligned to each other in protein space with the mummer tool promer and hit coordinates were then processed with the software DAGchainer to identify syntenic blocks between the two genomes .

[ABSTRACT] We further show that low-dose aspirin treatment , which is known to affect NG2-glia , or changes in gut microbiota , rescue both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants . Our study highlights a central role of NG2-glia for ME function during a transitional period of post-natal development and indicates their sensitivity to extrinsic signals . We demonstrate here that the absence of Sox3 predominantly affects the ME with phenotypes that first occur in juvenile animals , despite the embryonic onset of SOX3 expression . We and others previously showed that mutations and duplications affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox3 result in hypopituitarism , and this is likely of hypothalamic origin . The median eminence ( ME ) , located at the base of the hypothalamus , is an essential centre of information exchange between the brain and the pituitary . In the pituitary , reduction in hormone levels correlates with a lack of endocrine cell maturation . In parallel , ME NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential are affected .
[INTRODUCTION] Our study highlights a novel role for NG2-glia in the post-weaning formation of a functional ME and its control of pituitary maturation , and that an otherwise robust phenotype due to loss of Sox3 in these cells can be modified by non-genetic factors . The murine pituitary gland , which is located under the hypothalamus , has three compartments : the anterior pituitary lobe ( AL ) , containing five different endocrine cell types , the intermediate ( IL ) with one ( melanotrophs ) , and the posterior pituitary , composed of glial cells and hypothalamic axonal termini . In mice , we showed that SOX3 is largely absent from the pituitary , but it is found in the developing and mature hypothalamus , being particularly highly expressed in the embryonic infundibulum and later maintained in the ME ( and this study ) . The ME , which is located outside the blood-brain barrier , and the pituitary stalk are crucial components of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis , as flow of information in and out of the hypothalamus is respectively collected and conveyed through these structures . AL endocrine cells are regulated by neurohormones secreted by different hypothalamic neurons into a bed of fenestrated capillaries located at the base of the third ventricle , in a structure called the median eminence ( ME ) . Using conditional gene deletion , we show that loss of Sox3 in the central nervous system ( CNS ) is sufficient to cause hypopituitarism and that this develops postnatally , at the time of weaning . They are the most proliferative cells within the
[RESULTS] In conclusion , because NG2-glia in the ME are the cells mostly affected by Sox3 loss and their proliferation , but not differentiation to oligodendrocytes , is corrected by either low-dose Aspirin treatment or by a 'Crick-typical ' profile of gut microbiota , we propose that sufficient numbers of NG2-glia are required in the ME to support pituitary cell maturation as the animal becomes independent at weaning . Following our relocation and the rederivation by embryo transfer of our animals to the Francis Crick institute ( Crick ) from the National Institute for
[DISCUSSION] While we do not yet know if NG2-glia are required for pituitary hypophysiotropic neuron integrity , it is worth noting that hypopituitarism occurs in both humans and rats after cranial irradiation where NG2-glia may be the most sensitive cell type given their high rate of proliferation compared to other cell types in the brain . It is worth noting that the predominant phylum of gut microbiota at NIMR were Gram negative Bacteroidetes , which possess a unique diaminopimelate-containing GlcNAc-MurNAc tripeptide muropeptide ( GM-TriDAP ) sensed by NOD1 , while the most abundant phyla at the Crick are Gram-positive Firmicutes carrying the GlcNAc-MurNAc dipeptide ( GM-Di ) , which can be sensed by both NOD1 and NOD2 [ 85-87 ] . In this respect , a 'weaning reaction ' to microbiota has been described , and while this was associated with development of the immune system and protection against immunopathologies , gut bacterial cell wall components , muropeptides , can also be sensed directly via Nod1 and Nod2 receptors on cells in the brain , including the hypothalamus . We can not exclude an additional role for tanycytes , whose maintenance is also affected in Sox3 mutants , however , hypothalamic stem cells do not normally give rise to NG2-glia in adult mice ; it is therefore unlikely that the reduction in the number of ME NG2-glia in Sox3 mutants is secondary to the proliferation defect of the stem cells .

[ABSTRACT] The two-component GEF , CED-5/CED-12 , is known to activate CED-10/Rac1 to promote cell movements that result in the engulfment of dying cells during embryogenesis , and a later cell migration of the larval Distal Tip Cell . To address how CED-12/CED-5 could have two opposing effects on F-actin , during corpse engulfment and cell migration , we investigated if CED-12 harbors GAP ( GTPase Activating Protein ) functions . Mutating Serine-Arginine in CED-5/DOCK predicted to bind and stabilize Rac1 for catalysis , resulted in loss of both ventral enclosure and corpse engulfment . Thus , we propose CED-5/CED-12 support the cycling of multiple GTPases , by using distinct domains , to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation . However , we need to identify the GEF , or Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor , that activates CED-10/Rac1 during embryonic cell migrations . It is believed that CED-5/CED-12 powers cellular movements of corpse engulfment and DTC migration by promoting F-actin formation . Mutating a candidate catalytic Arginine in the CED-12 GAP region ( R537A ) altered the epidermal cell migration function , and not the corpse engulfment function . Our studies of C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis identified the GTPase CED-10/Rac1 as an essential activator of F-actin . CED-5/CED-12 definitely support embryonic migrations , since their loss led to embryos that died due to failed epidermal cell migrations . However , CED-5/CED-12 inhibited F-actin in the migrating epidermis , the opposite of what was expected for a CED-10 GEF . Understanding the proteins that regulate F-actin is important , since these proteins are mis-regulated in diseases like cancer . Genetic and expression studies strongly support that the GAP function likely acts on different GTPases . Therefore , we tested if CED-5/CED-12 was involved in embryonic migrations , and got a contradictory result . We interfered with GEF function by interfering with CED-5 's ability to bind Rac1/CED-10 . A candidate GAP region in CED-12 faces away from the CED-5 GEF catalytic region . Coordinated activation and inhibition of F-actin supports the movements of morphogenesis .
[INTRODUCTION] By focusing on the first movements of the epidermal cell sheet , ventral enclosure and dorsal intercalation , we have identified a pathway that promotes polarized enrichment of branched actin : the GTPase CED-10/Rac1 activates the WAVE/Scar complex , a nucleation promoting factor ( NPF ) for Arp2/3 . These studies raised the question of how actin is regulated during two apparently distinct processes , epidermal enclosure , a collective cell migration by the epidermal cells to engulf the entire embryo , and corpse engulfment , where part of the membrane of individual cells reorganizes to engulf their dying neighbors . The idea that embryonic cell migrations and cell corpse engulfment are linked in C. elegans was suggested when we reported that loss of the Arp2/3 regulators , gex-2 and gex-3 , resulted in both long-lived corpses and epidermal migration defects , similar to loss of Rac1/ced-10 . Analysis of a mutation in the newly identified GAP domain of CED-12 suggest CED-12/ELMO , uses different subdomains to switch from promoting to inhibiting F-actin formation , depending on the subcellular context . GTPases are proposed to be recruited and activated at membranes by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors , GEFs , that enhance the exchange of GDP for GTP , thus activating the GTPase ( Reviewed in ) . We present here analysis of the role of CED-5/DOCK and CED-12/ELMO , during epidermal morphogenesis , that shows these
[RESULTS] Since all of the mutants have long-lived corpses that last longer than in wild type controls , this result agrees with the model that F-actin enrichment around corpses is promoted by a molecular pathway that includes the GTPase CED-10 , its effector the WAVE complex , and its GEF CED-5/CED-12 , to engulf and remove corpses during development ( Fig 4C ) . To test if the embryonic lethality in the ced-12 ( pj74 ) R537A proposed GAP mutant correlated with
[DISCUSSION] Our findings here strongly support that the embryonic lethality of ced-12 , also seen in partner protein ced-5 , is due to failure to regulate F-actin during embryonic cell migrations , resulting in increased F-actin , altered dynamics and faster epidermal enclosure as the cells increase their migration rate . Our results suggest that at these earliest stages of embryonic development , when oocytes are being fertilized , the branched actin regulators CED-5/CED-12 , CED-10 and WAVE complex components , are required so that embryos are the correct length and shape , by promoting the correct levels of RHO-1 activity . To further investigate which GTPases are targets of the proposed GEF and GAP functions of CED-5/CED-12 , it may be possible to test binding of the purified CED-5/CED-12 complex to GTP and GDP loaded versions of the three main GTPases , as we and others have done . When we can image endogenous CED-12 in live animals , one prediction is that there will be different populations of CED-12 , carrying out distinct functions , both promoting and inhibiting F-actin , in different parts of the epidermal cells . Null mutations in CED-5 or CED-12 have consistently higher levels of F-actin in the migrating epidermal cells , and this correlated with

We also show that CED-15/CODK binds and stabilizes Rac1 for catalysis , resulting in loss of both the ventral enclosure and corpse . Mutating a candidate catalytic Arginine in the CED-12 GAP region ( R537A ) altered the epidermal cell migration function , but not the corpse-engulbment function .

[ABSTRACT] This could be achieved by a hierarchical organization of temporal processing through intrinsic mechanisms ( e. g. , recurrent coupling or adaptation ) , but recent evidence from spike recordings of the rodent visual system seems to conflict with this hypothesis . Here , we used an optimized information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to show that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation , while information-theoretic predictability decreases . Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas , while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code . Moreover , intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy , whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent . We could reproduce these observations in a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input . A core challenge for the brain is to process information across various timescales .
[INTRODUCTION] To address this question , it is important to note that a coding perspective entails a similar trade-off as the temporal-processing perspective ( long integration vs. fast relay ) : In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio , robust coding requires integrating information over time , whereas , for low noise , efficient coding of sensory information requires temporal decorrelation to reduce redundancies [ 49-51 ] . Second , although there exists evidence for gradients in interneuron numbers and intra-cortical connectivity from sensory to transmodal areas , the degree of interareal variation of microstructural properties in mice is far less pronounced than in the highly differentiated primate cortex [ 44-47 ] . In particular , higher cortical areas have an increased dendritic spine density for pyramidal neurons , overall excitation-inhibition ratio , the expression of related receptor genes , gray matter myelination , and the strength of functional connectivity . Finally , population codes vary between association and sensory cortices , and impairments to cortical frontal ( transmodal ) areas have a greater impact on evidence accumulation over long timescales than posterior ( sensory ) areas , which also exhibit shorter activity timescales during evidence accumulation . In primates , past work suggested that this may be supported by two essential features of neocortex : the highly recurrent architecture of cortical networks , and an organization of different cortical areas into a temporal processing hierarchy [ 2-4 ] . It was found that early sensory areas specialize on fast processing of sensory inputs [ 5-7 ] , whereas higher ( transmodal ) areas perform temporal processing with long timescales-combining new information with past information that
[RESULTS] An alternative hypothesis is that stronger recurrence enables longer integration of visual information , which is thought to be a cause of long intrinsic timescales in primates To test these hypotheses , we note that feedforward processing predicts overall higher timescales and a more pronounced hierarchy under stimulation with a natural movie ( with long stimulus timescales ) when compared to spontaneous activity in the absence of a time-varying visual stimulus , where the correlation timescale corresponds to the intrinsic timescale . Thus , although some relations exist , our chosen measures go beyond simple
[DISCUSSION] Our analysis of data from different stimulus conditions and recurrent network models further indicated that the gradients in timescales are supported by stimulus-independent , network-intrinsic mechanisms , such as an increasing recurrence along the anatomical hierarchy . In contrast , the stimulus-dependent decrease in predictability is in agreement with efficient coding and the observed increase in adaptation in rodents , as well as a formation of increasingly invariant , high-level visual representations , and might constitute another hallmark of hierarchical temporal processing in mammals . Until now it has remained open whether single sensory pathways in cortex show a hierarchical organization of temporal processing , especially in rodents , where cortex exhibits less cognitive processing and fewer levels of abstractions compared to primates . Here , we found that the visual pathway in mouse cortex indeed shows signatures of such a hierarchy in the form of a gradual increase in correlation and information timescales , and a decrease in predictability along the anatomical hierarchy .
[METHODS] Therefore , we built the following two models : All these parameters are modelled hierarchically , where for each mouse there is a parameter set θj , and each parameter θk , j of that set is drawn from a normal parent distribution with mean μ θ k and variance μ θ k. This type of modelling respects that data are collected from different mice , but still",,859,91,None,"A core challenge for the brain is to process information across various timescales .

[ABSTRACT] The study goal was to use epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn through which the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS , including direct and indirect waves , could be investigated . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) is a non-invasive , FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications , but the neural circuits that are engaged during TMS are still poorly understood . Moreover , activation of both afferents to the motor cortex as well as specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves , and the results were interpreted to propose the cortical origins of afferents that may give rise to certain I-waves . The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to both identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation . Single wave preference could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and L5 pyramidal tract neurons ( PTNs ) . Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to TMS , and therefore a new opportunity to model neural circuit dynamics . The results support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons . An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways , and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways . For these activations , the total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave . Finally , there were multiple neuron type activations that could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave . Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves .
[INTRODUCTION] One approach to understanding these network effects in the motor cortex is via descending volleys of activity that propagate to the spinal cord in response to TMS and can be recorded epidurally as transient corticospinal waves ( Fig 1 ) . Starting from a reduced version of the Esser model , that could produce I-waves and is mathematically compact , we established a spiking neuronal network model of motor cortex that reproduced the features of D-waves and I-waves recorded epidurally in the cervical spine of human subjects . Intrinsic neuronal mechanisms have also been hypothesized to allow L5 PTNs to behave as neural oscillators such that the I-waves result from repeated spiking from the same neuron due to the dynamics following initial excitation by TMS . However , improving methodologies and developing new applications remain slow and challenging due to the uncertainties about what is activated by TMS and how this activation courses through the circuits within and beyond the stimulated region . However , the models were not directly constrained by experimental recordings and lacked an exhaustive sensitivity analysis to investigate , among other variables , the effects of inhomogeneous activation across different neuron types . Current understanding of I-waves arises from epidural recordings combined with pharmacological interventions that identified the synaptic receptors involved in I-wave generation and broadly suggested excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms that contribute to I-waves . Finally , machine learning and graph theoretical measures were
[RESULTS] The most important features to identify parameters that preferentially activated a single corticospinal wave were a strong average connection probability to L5 PTNs and whether the overall effect on the L5 PTNs was excitatory or inhibitory with a validation classification accuracy of 97 . Due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space ( 98 parameters ) , total grid search , random , or quasi-random sampling would require a prohibitively large number of simulations to characterize fully the relationships between the parameters
[DISCUSSION] To generalize , the results of the structural analysis suggest that if the generator of a signal within a network is known , and the connection probabilities and conduction delays of the network are known , then the network elements that preferentially contribute to singular peaks of a system 's impulse response can be screened by performing the following : for each neuron type 1 ) identify all possible paths from the neuron type to the signal generator , 2 ) compute the ratios of the log of the connection probability between the most highly connected path and the remaining paths normalized by the sum of all log probabilities , and 3 ) obtain the latency of effect for the most highly connected path . The secondary analysis revealed that the anatomical structure of the network , i. e. , the wiring diagram and conduction latencies that resulted from the anatomical constraints , were then important for predicting the circuit activations that give rise to specific I-waves with both the recruitment of afferents to L2/3 and L6 IT cells being possible mechanisms . Therefore , the results can not be generalized to explain effects to conditions beyond the experimental data it was optimized to reproduce , i. e. , the results are only valid for

[INTRODUCTION] While this review focuses on pregnancy , much of what is discussed applies to the cell-free DNA field in general , including other clinical contexts such as cancer . Since its discovery in 1997 , cfpDNA has been used in the clinical setting for noninvasive prenatal testing ( NIPT ) to screen for fetal genetic aberrations , most notably chromosomal aneuploidies . CfpDNA has been detected as early as the fourth week of gestation and has been estimated to comprise up to approximately 40 % of total maternal plasma cell-free DNA [ 2-4 ] . However , the understanding of the basic biology underlying cfpDNA remains limited , placing constraints on the information that can be obtained from analyzing cfpDNA . In this review , we will examine the current understanding of cfpDNA , highlight gaps in knowledge , and discuss future research directions ( Fig 1 ) . Further characterization of physical , genetic , and epigenetic characteristics of cfpDNA will pave the way for further basic research and clinical applications .

[ABSTRACT] Using data from genome-wide association studies , we showed spatial clustering of risk variants across four HDCs ( breast , endometrial , ovarian and prostate cancers ) , contrasting with genetically uncorrelated traits . Known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes , implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or facilitate the repurposing of existing treatments for HDC . Integrating GWAS data , epigenomic profiling and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models , we annotated 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions . Additionally , we pinpointed lncRNAs as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factors motifs , suggesting regulatory mechanisms . These targets were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census , but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles . We identified 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome , defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs : two regions contained risk variants for all four HDCs , 13 for three HDCs and 28 for two HDCs . Our approach provides a framework for identifying common target genes driving complex traits and enhances understanding of HDC susceptibility . Hormone-dependent cancers ( HDCs ) share several risk factors , suggesting a common aetiology .
[INTRODUCTION] This premise is supported by genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) which have identified hundreds of cancer-specific risk loci [ 4-7 ] and multiple pleiotropic loci associated with at least two HDCs [ 8-11 ] . This is complicated by the fact that most risk variants reside in noncoding regions of the genome making it difficult to interpret how they contribute to cancer susceptibility . However , these methods are limited by small sample sizes which reduces power , the use of steady-state gene expression and the lack of data from relevant tissues . The detection of pleiotropic loci suggests that shared genetic factors likely contribute to polygenic risk of HDCs and raises the possibility of common driver genes and biological pathways . Target gene mapping for pleiotropic loci typically relies on statistical approaches such as expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL ) and transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) . Breast , endometrial , ovarian and prostate cancers are hormone-dependent cancers ( HDCs ) that together account for up to 30 % of new cancer diagnoses each year . Orthologous functional assays provide complementary mapping approaches to better define regulatory variants and connect them to their target genes . A key aim of post-GWAS is to identify the target gene ( s ) that are affected at each GWAS region . These cancers share several environmental , behavioural and genetic risk factors , suggesting a common aetiology .
[DISCUSSION] We first annotated each mHDCR region with protein-coding genes from GENCODE ( v37 basic ) and intersected all candidate variants with genomic annotations ( exons , promoters defined as transcription start site ( TSS ) ± 2 kb and intronic and intergenic regions ; S1A Fig ) . Furthermore , we focused on identifying protein-coding genes , but studies by ourselves ( and others ) show that long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) are also transcribed from cancer risk regions and can have important roles in tumorigenesis [ 37-41 ] . Some are known pleiotropic cancer genes ( e. g MYC , CCND1 ; S4 Fig ) supporting the validity of our approach , but many have only been statistically and/or functionally associated with individual HDCs and may represent new mHDCR genes . To assess whether HDC variants were more frequently positioned together than would be expected by chance , we defined `` clusters '' when variants associated with two or more HDCs were co-localized within the same 100 kb window . These traits showed similar genomic distributions to randomly generated background regions ( Fig 1A ) , which provided support that HDC risk regions co-localize in the genome and that these regions likely contain pleiotropic variants and common target genes . The candidate mHDCR gene list was enriched for known cancer genes and drug targets , which provides support that other , less-well-characterized genes at mHDCR regions may play important roles in HDC development .
[METHODS] To generate target regions for PCHiC , mHDCR regions were extended by 1Mb on either side , so that all possible promoter-enhancer interactions involving regions containing HDC risk variants were captured . Annotation of variants with respect to genomic intervals ( exons , introns , TADs , and promoters ) and to link with candidate distal target genes were performed with the GenomicRanges and GenomicInteractions BioConductor packages .",,858,91,None,"Despite the fact that most risk variants reside in noncoding regions of the genome , it is difficult to interpret how they contribute to cancer susceptibility .

[ABSTRACT] We suggest that elements located 10-49 kb upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play an important role in the regulation of the canine genes and that deletion of these elements is a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs . Our results suggest that distant variants upstream of IL21 could also be important for human autoimmune diseases that have been found to be associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region . Next Generation Sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment , located 10 kb upstream of the neighbouring interleukin genes IL21 and IL2 . Leukocytes of affected , untreated dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpress IL21 and IL2 upon stimulation with mitogens . A genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls indicated the involvement of a region on chromosome CFA19 ( p = 4 . Postulating causality , the penetrance of the disease phenotype was estimated at 10-20 % for homozygous dogs and 0 . The familial occurrence of the disease were suggestive of an inherited cause . Here we report the results of our molecular genetic investigation . Recently we characterized polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog . 25 in a random sample of the Kooiker dog breed . 9 Mb region in the homozygous or the heterozygous state . Haplotype analysis indicated that the cases shared a 2 . 5-2 % for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion . The frequency of the deletion allele was 0 . 81 in the available cases and 0 . 7 * 10−10 ) .
[INTRODUCTION] Serum creatine kinase activity was almost invariably elevated , and histopathology of available muscle biopsies revealed predominantly lymphohistiocytic infiltration usually showing a low and variable number of eosinophils , neutrophils and plasma cells . The condition occurred more often in the Kooiker dog breed than in other breeds and littermates of affected dogs appeared to be at increased risk for developing PM . An autosomal recessive IM in Dutch shepherd dogs in an isolated breeding line in the US was reported to be caused by a variant in the mitochondrial aspartate and glutamate carrier encoded by SLC25A12 . Dog breeds in general have been established with a small number of founders , are therefore genetically homogeneous and excellent sources for molecular research of monogenic and polygenic traits [ 3-6 ] . Additional risk variants in these two breeds were recognized in the genes PAN2 and MAP3K7CL , and the risk of dermatomyositis increased with the total number of risk alleles carried by the dogs . Other genes that have been associated with human idiopathic IM and PM include SDK2 , LINC00924 , STAT4 , NAB1 , TEC , LTBR , DGQK , and FAM167A-BLK . An autoimmune-mediated inflammatory myopathy ( IM ) was seen with increasing frequency in the breed of Nederlandse Kooikerhondjes , named Kooiker dogs hereafter . Inherited causes of distinct forms of IM have been investigated in Vizsla dogs , Boxers , Newfoundland dogs , Dutch shepherd dogs , Shetland sheepdogs and Collies [ 7-10 ] . At
[RESULTS] The later generated whole genome sequences of three Kooiker dogs , one of which was homozygous for the deletion allele and two that were heterozygous , did not reveal variants in the critical region that justified further investigation ( S6 Table ) . Since all cases had one or two copies of the haplotype and the same genotypes were also represented in the control group , we suggested that the mode of inheritance of PM was semidominant with incomplete penetrance . Targeted resequencing was performed of all
[DISCUSSION] Overexpression of IL-21 is observed in tissues and sera of human patients with autoimmune diseases such as systematic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , and primary Sjögren syndrome ( SS ) . According to data in TADKB , the two genes are located on the same topologically associating domains ( TADs ) in diverse human cell lines , suggesting their expression could be coordinated . It will be interesting to learn whether human cases of autoimmune diseases that map to the IL21/IL2 locus carry specific variants in the region syntenic to the 39 kb deletion . Meanwhile , the PCR assay to genotype the deletion allele in Kooiker dogs provides a tool for breeders to prevent the birth of high risk dogs and reduce the incidence of polymyositis in the breed . We postulated that the deletion affects the regulation of one or both of the adjacent interleukin genes IL21 and IL2 , thereby increasing the risk for superfluous inflammatory reactions . By targeted deletion of smaller DNA fragments in a wild-type cell line , capable of IL21 expression in response to stimulation , these elements could be identified . Follow-up experiments should be directed to fine-mapping of the DNA elements in the 39 kb fragment that are involved in the expression

[ABSTRACT] Engineering campaigns commonly seek to improve protein stability , and there is a strong interest in streamlining these processes to enable rapid optimization of highly stabilized proteins with fewer iterations . ESMtherm is trained on the folding stability of 528k natural and de novo sequences derived from 461 protein domains and can accommodate deletions , insertions , and multiple-point mutations . Our results highlight the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature . Lastly , we discuss our model 's limitations compared to other state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds . Protein stability plays a crucial role in a variety of applications , such as food processing , therapeutics , and the identification of pathogenic mutations . In this work , we explore utilizing a mega-scale dataset to develop a protein language model optimized for stability prediction . ESMtherm performs reasonably on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set . We show that a protein language model can be fine-tuned to predict folding stability .
[INTRODUCTION] More recently , the use of machine learning models grounded in biophysical features and evolutionary statistics [ 12-20 ] has offered an alternative approach to stability and function prediction without the need for computationally intensive molecular modeling simulations . While merging smaller datasets into a more comprehensive collection , such as ProTherm , ProtaBank and ThermoMutDB , is a feasible approach , combined datasets often consist of closely related but distinct quantities accompanied by additional discrepancies in experimental conditions . Fueled by the latest advances in deep learning , convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) and graph neural networks ( GNNs ) are now being adopted to predict mutational impacts on stability by operating directly on the input protein structure . While deep mutagenesis scanning ( DMS ) offers profound insights , these studies typically focus on a single protein target , limiting the broader applicability of the derived data and models subsequently trained on these datasets . We also demonstrate that training on an ensemble of protein domains , instead of mutagenesis studies of a single domain , improves the performance of the fine-tuned protein language model for folding stability prediction . For example , RaSP is a CNN-based model trained on top of Rosetta , while ELASPIC-2 , another stability predictor , operates on both sequence embedding from ESM and structural embedding from GNN [ 26-28 ] . introduced a mega-scale thermostability dataset , encompassing 776k short protein sequences derived from 479 small protein domains , all consistently evaluated using the same assay . We observe that ESMtherm performs comparably with state-of-the-art models and generalizes to small protein sequences distal to those of the training set . Lastly
[RESULTS] The mega-scale dataset addresses this difficulty by measuring folding stability across multiple protein domains in a uniform experimental condition , and it helps us compare two paradigms , i. e. transfer learning from homologous sequences and learning from all domains collectively . These include Rosetta Cartesian ΔΔG for molecular modeling , MUPro for support vector machine ( SVM ) on traditional sequence features , RaSP for structure-based CNN , ELASPIC-2 which employs a machine-learning model based on both structure and sequence embedding , and unsupervised prediction from ESM-2 . Although the improvement brought by collective training highlights
[DISCUSSION] Although its performance on larger protein scaffolds is lagging behind state-of-the-art , a folding stability dataset of larger proteins might be vital to improving the generalizability of ESMtherm . This approach generalizes successfully to protein domains distal from the training set , showing the potential of transfer learning to reduce experimental burden . Enabled by large-scale protein stability measurements , we fine-tuned ESM-2 on the absolute folding energy of small protein domains . Furthermore , our result highlights the benefits of training collectively on all protein sequences instead of mutagenesis study on a single wildtype . In this work , we demonstrate that folding stability prediction is possible using a protein language model .
[METHODS] Given the intensive computing resource required to benchmark Rosetta , we limited ourselves to six DMS datasets on direct and indirect stability measurements from ProteinGym , and another independent mutational dataset ( BglB ) from Huang et al . To evaluate the model on both training and test-set-only domains , we split our dataset into train , validation , and test sets by domains as illustrated in Fig 1",,823,90,None,"Protein stability plays a crucial role in a variety of applications , such as food processing , therapeutics , and the identification of pathogenic mutations .

[ABSTRACT] We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1D dataset ( N = 11 , 961 ) and found that iKIR genes , in the presence of genes encoding their ligands , have a consistent and significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations . In T1D , variation in the Human Leucocyte Antigen ( HLA ) genes explains up to 50 % of the genetic risk , indicating that T cells have a major role in T1D etiopathogenesis . We hypothesized that in the context of autoimmunity , where an enhanced T cell response might be considered detrimental , iKIRs would have an opposite effect . We conclude that iKIRs significantly decrease HLA class II protective associations and suggest that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D . To investigate if iKIRs affect this T cell response , we asked whether HLA associations were modified by iKIR genes . Inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ) are a family of inhibitory receptors that are expressed by natural killer ( NK ) cells and late-stage differentiated T cells . Recently , we reported that T cell-mediated control was enhanced by iKIRs in chronic viral infections . We studied Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) as a paradigmatic example of autoimmunity . There is accumulating evidence that iKIRs regulate T cell-mediated immunity . Our results were validated in an independent data set .
[INTRODUCTION] We sought to test this hypothesis by investigating the impact of iKIRs on HLA class II disease associations in T1D using a large ( N = 11 , 961 ) case-control dataset from the UK Genetics Resource Investigating Diabetes ( UK-GRID ) . Since 2003 , 15 studies have reported KIR gene associations with T1D risk , but none has been consistently reproduced and , in a recent meta-analysis , no associations survived correction for multiple comparisons . Our immunogenetic analyses show that genes encoding iKIRs with their ligands decrease protective class II genetic associations , consistent with a picture in which iKIRs modulate T cell-mediated regulation of autoimmunity . Consequently , it is common for individuals to have one or more iKIRs without the corresponding ligand ; if an individual is positive for a given iKIR as well as the matching ligand we refer to that iKIR as `` functional '' . Furthermore , iKIRs with their ligands also enhance protective and detrimental HLA class I associations and have a significant impact on the clinical outcome of three different chronic viral infections . We distinguish this modulation of protective and detrimental HLA associations by functional iKIR , which we suggest is due to a modulation of T cell responses by iKIR , from a main effect of functional iKIR , which we suggest is more likely to be NK cell-mediated . Within the HLA region , the closely linked classical class II HLA-DRB1 , HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 genes display the strongest associations indicating that CD4+ T
[RESULTS] Nevertheless to investigate the impact of potential population stratification we used a generalized linear mixed model ( GLMM ) including iKIR score as an interaction term with a given protective genotype as fixed effect and a random effect reflecting the genetic relatedness between each pair of individuals ( S1 Materials and methods ) ; an approach which has shown better performance compared to a more traditional principal components approach . We found that out of 3×107 permutations there was never a case where the test statistic of the permuted
[DISCUSSION] Although the absence of evidence for an interaction between functional iKIR genes and HLA class II genes in candidate gene studies can easily be explained by the argument that no one was motivated to study this particular three-way genetic association , it might be wondered why it was not picked up in one of the very large `` catch-all '' genome wide association studies ( GWAS ) performed in T1D [ 29-31 ] . Ligation of iKIRs expressed on the surface of T cells leads to phosphorylation of ITIMs in their cytoplasmic tail which recruits phosphatases including SHP1 leading to inhibition of TCR signalling which in turn can decrease effector function including cytokine production and regulation or modulate differentiation ; iKIRs on T cells have also been shown in vitro and in murine models to prolong CD8+ and CD4+ T cell lifetime . The reason is that three gene associations of the type we report ( KIR-ligand-class II ) are never studied in GWAS as the explosion in the number of multiple comparisons for comparing all triplets of variants is prohibitive and so it is to be expected that the functional iKIR modification of HLA class II associations which we report would not be found by GWAS . We predicted that an increase of T cell survival-driven by a high number of functional iKIR genes-would have a detrimental effect only when

[ABSTRACT] In summary , our study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms , RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation , both underpin the pathophysiology of FECD . Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ( FECD ) is an age-related cause of vision loss , and the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans characterised to date . Interrogation of long-read sequencing and alternative splicing analysis of short-read transcriptomic data together reveals the global extent of altered splicing occurring within Exp+ FECD , and unique transcripts associated with CTG18 . Furthermore , differential exon usage , pathway enrichment and spatial transcriptomics reveal TCF4 isoform ratio skewing solely in Exp+ FECD with potential downstream functional consequences . 1 expansion-driven molecular components of disease within primary patient-derived corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ) , generated from a large cohort of individuals with CTG18 . The non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4 have made it extremely challenging to experimentally decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease . We anticipate these data will inform and guide the development of translational interventions for this common triplet-repeat mediated disease . Up to 80 % of European FECD cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element ( termed CTG18 . 005 ) and potentially deleterious ( CADD > 15 ) TCF4 variants in 7/134 FECD Exp- cases , suggesting that TCF4 variants independent of CTG18 . Similarly , differential gene expression analysis highlights the total transcriptomic consequences of Exp+ FECD within CECs . We employ long-read , short-read , and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific transcriptomic biomarkers . Lastly , exome data from 134 Exp- FECD cases identified rare ( minor allele frequency < 0 . 1 ) located within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene , TCF4 . Here we comprehensively describe CTG18 . 1-expanded ( Exp+ ) and CTG 18 . 1 may increase FECD risk . 1-independent ( Exp- ) FECD . 1-expansions .
[INTRODUCTION] Expansion of non-coding repeat elements within the human genome have been identified to cause more than 30 human diseases to date , including fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome , myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 and C9orf72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and frontotemporal dementia . However , to date , it has only been established that it affects the cornea , which is in contrast to the majority of the other much rarer non-coding repeat expansion disorders that typically have devastating outcomes on neurological and/or neuromuscular systems . We , and others , have demonstrated that RNA toxicity comprising splicing dysregulation attributed to the accumulation of CUG-containing RNA foci and sequestration of splicing factors MBNL1 and MBNL2 within affected cells , is a key feature of FECD in the presence of one or more expanded CTG18 . For example , TCF4 haploinsufficiency results in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome , a severe neurodevelopmental disorder , whereas somatic TCF4 mutations are commonly identified in Sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma and common germline variants have been associated with Schizophrenia risk . We have previously demonstrated , in our large ( n = 450 ) FECD cohort , that an expanded copy of this CTG repeat ( defined as ≥50 copies ) confers > 76-fold increased risk for developing FECD . Furthermore , because TCF4 comprises > 90 alternative spatially and temporally expressed isoforms , deciphering transcript-specific level dysregulation has proven to be
[RESULTS] While total TCF4 gene expression was not significantly downregulated in Exp+ ( Fig 2B ) , intriguingly , we observed strong parallels to pathway enrichment analyses highlighted from a study of TCF4 neural progenitor knockdown cell model within the 3 , 292 genes uniquely dysregulated in Exp+ , such as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum , MAPK signalling , actin cytoskeletal regulation , endocytosis and apoptosis ( Fig 2D ) . To determine if other RNA-binding proteins may be implicated in the
[DISCUSSION] Our extensive long- and short-read RNA-Seq data and spatial transcriptomic analysis of FECD case-derived CEC lines demonstrates that , in addition to being a spliceopathy , expansion-positive FECD is concurrently associated with isoform-specific patterns of TCF4 dysregulation , hence providing novel mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of this triplet-repeat mediated disease . We anticipate that concepts and biomarkers identified by this study will inform and guide the development of future translational interventions targeting this triplet-repeat mediated disease , and these in turn may act as exemplars for much rarer and currently untreatable and severe repeat expansion disorders that typically affect less accessible neurological/neuromuscular systems . Other membrane encoding proteins interfacing with the extracellular matrix or signal transduction could also be a rich source of potential external markers , such as cell surface receptors involved in the P13K-Akt pathway ( e. g. EGFR , MET , and LTK ) that we show are specifically upregulated in Exp+ CECs . For instance , we have discovered a novel array of RBP encoding transcripts , including MBNL3 , CELF1 and a range of hnRNP and DDX family members , uniquely dysregulated in Exp+ CECs that warrant future follow up to elucidate their respective contributions to aberrant RNA metabolism related mechanisms . To tackle this challenge , we

[ABSTRACT] Direct seeding is employed to circumvent the labor-intensive process of rice ( Oryza sativa ) transplantation , but this approach requires varieties with vigorous low-temperature germination ( LTG ) when sown in cold climates . To investigate the genetic basis of LTG , we identified the quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) qLTG11 from rice variety Arroz da Terra , which shows rapid seed germination at lower temperatures , using QTL-seq . Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line ( NIL ) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG , whereas overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG , indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11 . We delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h ( GF14h ) gene , which is expressed during seed germination . Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost from popular varieties during modern breeding . The Arroz da Terra GF14h allele encodes functional GF14h , whereas Japanese rice variety Hitomebore harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region . We generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra including GF14h . The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions . The NIL showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore , with otherwise comparable agronomic traits .
[INTRODUCTION] In practice , it is essential to generate pre-breeding materials for QTL pyramiding , i. e. , near-isogenic lines ( NILs ) that harbor one or a few genomic segments introgressed from the donor parent into the genome of the recipient parent through a combination of continuous backcrossing and selfing via marker-assisted selection . These proteins bind to phosphorylated serine and tyrosine residues in their target proteins that participate in signal transduction and the regulation of gene expression , thus altering their enzymatic activity , subcellular localization , stability , or protein-protein interactions [ 23-25 ] . We generated a NIL in the background of rice cultivar Hitomebore , which is adapted for growth in northern Japan , by replacing its GF14h genomic fragment with that from Arroz da Terra and tested its LTG performance . Linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified over 30 LTG-related quantitative trait loci ( QTLs ) or genomic regions associated with this trait , located on all 12 rice chromosomes [ 3-20 ] . QTL pyramiding has been proposed as a breeding concept for bringing together several QTLs ( or genes ) related to agronomically important traits in the genetic background of locally adapted elite cultivars . As rice originated from tropical and subtropical regions , it is highly susceptible to low-temperature conditions compared to other cereal crops such as wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) . In recent years , there has been an increasing demand to shift from conventional transplantation-based
[RESULTS] We reconstructed the GF14h haplotype network using genotype data obtained from whole-genome resequencing of 492 O. sativa accessions from various collections , including the World Rice Core Collection , the Rice Core Collection of Japanese Landraces , and a set of Japanese landraces and modern varieties , in addition to 11 wild rice ( O. rufipogon ) accessions ( S2 Table ) . Within the candidate region , the gene Os11g0609600 , corresponding to the 14-3-3 gene GF14h , was expressed in both Hitomebore and qLTG11-NIL , whereas Os11g0609500
[DISCUSSION] It is also worth mentioning that our experiments were performed in the qLTG11-NIL background , which allowed us to isolate the contribution of GF14h to LTG without any influence from qLTG3-1 or other genes in the Arroz da Terra background . This trend has continued to the present , perhaps as a result of artificial selection to improve resistance to pre-harvest sprouting , with more than 80 % of all varieties bred since 2001 carrying these loss-of-function alleles . Notably , the haplotypes of qLTG3-1 , a major QTL behind LTG , are different between Nipponbare and Hitomebore : whereas Nipponbare , which was released in 1961 , harbors the functional allele of qLTG3-1 , Hitomebore carries a loss-of-function allele with a deletion of 71 bp ( S2 Fig ) . In addition , as mentioned in previous reports , we believe that the reintroduction of functional alleles should be considered in order to develop cultivars suitable for labor-saving cultivation techniques such as direct seeding . Moreover , the cultivars Koshihikari and Hayamasari , which carry the same loss-of-function qLTG3-1 allele as the Hitomebore variety , were reported to exhibit lower germination rates at low temperatures than Nipponbare . We expect that reintroducing beneficial alleles like GF14hArroz that were lost during modern breeding into future rice varieties will enable the implementation of new cultivation practices and increase productivity . In a

Total RNA was extracted from Hitomebore and qLTG11-NIL seeds at 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 days after the",,951,96,None,"Rice ( Oryza sativa ) is a staple cereal crop in Japan .

[ABSTRACT] Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) analysis revealed that the positive ( + ) strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wt nt1822 residue , indicating that the 5 ' TR of ( - ) strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication , forming a duplex with the ( + ) strand DNA , while the 3 ' TR forms a flap-like structure , which is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation . Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) possesses an 8-9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy ( TR , or r ) on the negative ( - ) strand DNA derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) . To address these questions , a mutant HBV cell line HepDES-C1822G was established with a C1822G mutation in the pgRNA coding sequence , altering the sequence of 3 ' TR of ( - ) strand DNA while the 5 ' TR remained wild type ( wt ) . In a survey of known cellular flap endonucleases using a loss-of-function study , we found that the 3 ' flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells , alongside the 5 ' flap endonuclease FEN1 . It remains unclear whether the TR forms a 5 ' or 3 ' flap structure on HBV rcDNA and which TR copy is removed during covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) formation . The overlapping function between Mus81 and FEN1 in cccDNA formation indicates that the putative 5 ' and 3 ' flap formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursor . Additionally , we have mapped the potential Mus81 and FEN1 cleavage sites within the TR of nuclear DP-rcDNA by RACE-NGS analyses . These findings shed light on HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms , contributing to our understanding of HBV replication cycle . The production of HBV rcDNA and cccDNA in HepDES-C1822G cells was comparable to wt levels .
[INTRODUCTION] Unlike host chromosomal DNA and other viruses with double-stranded circular DNA genomes such as papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses , the authentic HBV cccDNA does not undergo semi-conservative replication but is only converted from viral relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) during de novo infection and/or via the intracellular amplification pathway ( also known as ( aka ) rcDNA recycling pathway ) . Comparing the major differences between rcDNA and cccDNA ( Fig 1A ) , a series of biological reactions are required to correct the molecular peculiarities on rcDNA termini during cccDNA formation , including 1 ) completion of positive ( + ) strand DNA synthesis ; 2 ) removal of the 5 ' end capped RNA primer on ( + ) strand DNA ; 3 ) removal of viral Pol covalently attached to the 5 ' end of negative ( - ) strand DNA ; 4 ) removal of one copy of the terminal redundancy ( TR , or r ) on ( - ) strand DNA ; 5 ) ligation of both strands to generate the bona fide cccDNA . Despite the unavailability of an exact topological information of the putative terminal flap structure on HBV rcDNA , previous studies , likely inspired by the aforementioned DHBV study , have demonstrated that the 5 ' flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 ( FEN1 ) plays a role in HBV cccDNA production in cell-based phenotypic assays and in
[RESULTS] Regarding the 3 ' end of nuclear DP-rcDNA ( - ) strand , the longer 3 ' termini in induced HepAD38 control cells were predominantly mapped at 1821T and 1822G ( Fig 12A and 12C and S1 Table ) ( indicated by asterisks ) , while the former position is consistent with the 3 ' RACE result of rcDNA ( - ) strand from HepDES19 cells ( Fig 2 ) , representing the unprocessed 3 ' end ; the latter might be
[DISCUSSION] We attempted to knock out both Mus81 and FEN1 by CRISPR but was unsuccessful , likely due to the requirement for at least one of these two flap endonucleases being present to maintain cell viability , and hence , although we have assessed all the four known flap endonucleases for their involvement in cccDNA formation , it remains possible that there is an unidentified flap endonuclease ( s ) plays redundant role in HBV rcDNA TR removal . III ) after 3 ' TR removal as described in scenario II , host DNA polymerases ( POLκ , α , δ ) are recruited to the gap and resynthesize the 3 ' TR using ( + ) strand DNA as template , then the continued DNA elongation displaces the 5 ' TR , forming a 5 ' flap for FEN1 to cut as shown in scenario I. IV ) both 5 ' and 3 ' flap structures are formed on the same nuclear DP-rcDNA molecule and simultaneously removed by FEN1 and Mus81 , respectively , followed by 3 ' TR resynthesis and ligation . While the ( + ) strand DNA sequencing results suggest that a DNA duplex forms between the 5 ' TR and the ( + ) strand during rcDNA formation
[METHODS] The above PCR products ( 400-450 bp ) amplifying junctions of sequence adaptors and either HBV ( - ) strand DNA 5 ' or 3 ' end were subjected to DNA sequencing library preparation as follows : 55 μl of the diluted DNA ( 5 ng/μl ) was sheared using Covaris M220 with the following settings : Duty",,1029,90,Exceeds token limit (1029/1024),"Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) relax circular DNA ( rcDNA ) is a double-stranded circular DNA genome derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) .

[ABSTRACT] Here , we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model ( mmGEM ) based on metabolic cross-feeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory . Assessing cross-feeding dynamics under varying OLRs enabled the execution of practical scenario-based simulations to explore the potential impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance . Although microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified , comprehensive knowledge of the convergent community structure and pathways of adaptation is lacking . Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates ( OLRs ) increased , along with a decline in MFC performance . The efficiency of microbial fuel cells ( MFCs ) in industrial wastewater treatment is profoundly influenced by the microbial community , which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations . The simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide ( S ) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB . The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments . This work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs . The metabolic model encompassed three major microbial guilds : sulfate-reducing bacteria ( SRB ) , methanogens ( MET ) , and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria ( SOB ) . More cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET , facilitating their competitive dominance . The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs ( L-OLRs ) and adaptation to high OLRs ( H-OLRs ) .
[INTRODUCTION] The approach has been improved in a number of ways to enable the simulation of the complex connections between microbial species in the real-world situation , for examples incorporation of microbial ecology constraints , contextualization of community dynamics through integration of omics data , and inclusion of spatial and temporal effects on microbial interactions and composition under dynamic environments [ 39-41 ] . To this end , we developed an effective modeling approach of microbe-microbe interaction GEM , or mmGEM , based on a functional-based lumped compartmentalized structural model design of the main microbial guilds that hold essential metabolic capabilities required for MCF substrate conversion under context of study . In particular , the genome-scale metabolic models ( GEMs ) of microbial communities created using Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ) framework allow the observation of mechanistic scenarios of microbial interactions under any studied conditions that are not restricted to the realm of empirical experiments [ 30-33 ] . Despite significant progress , the compartmentalized GEMs model still faces challenges in maximizing the number of community members in model coverage and minimizing computational load resulting from the large number of complexly associated components in order to arrive at a mathematically plausible solution . The GEMs approach is typically conceived as an integrated compartmental model to represent the fundamental metabolic process generated by the entire microbial community , or as a compartmentalized model to mimic the complementation and restriction inter-relationships between individual metabolic processes provided by the community members .
[RESULTS] The results showed that these microbial guilds exchanged metabolites , mainly butyrate , acetate , sulfate , sulfide , NH4 , methane , and CO2 , ( Fig 2B , left ) , which served as key carbon and nitrogen sources and metabolic currency compounds involved in core biosynthesis processes of microbial metabolism , emphasizing the significance of syntrophic cross-feeding relationships within the MFC microbiome . The model was also built on the assumptions that : 1 ) the equilibrium state of the ecosystem is mainly
[DISCUSSION] Through functional-based lumped compartmentalized modeling , the mmGEM facilitated a comprehensive study of the intricate dynamic metabolic interactions within microbial communities in MFCs , ultimately enhancing our understanding of microbial ecology and facilitating the optimization of MFC performance for various biotechnological applications . By increasing the amount of proton ( H+ ) in the MFC environment , we simulate the growth of SOB , enhance ATP production , strengthen SRB-SOB interactions , and boost MFC performance . This work highlights the significant role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial composition and MFC performance under varying OLRs . These interactions collectively led to changes in the composition and structure of the microbial community within the MFC system , finally impacting performance . The anticipated outcomes offered a hopeful prospect for the long-term functioning of MFCs , illuminating potential future applications within the industrial domain . Here , it presents a detailed description of the transition from an SOB-dominant community at L-OLRs to a MET-dominant community at H-OLRs , as the MFC performance declines . We propose a manipulation strategy to enhance MFC performance by sustaining the dominance of SOB under H-OLR conditions . Specifically , we observed a deterioration in SRB-SOB interactions , including S cycling and acetate cross-feeding . This transition can be attributed to dynamic interactions among microbial groups in the system .

[ABSTRACT] Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control , better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods , and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data . In those applications , ML models are used to predict the properties of biological systems , and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates as new biological hypotheses for downstream experimental validations . One solution to address this issue is to quantify the model 's prediction uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate ( FDR ) pre-specified by researchers . We expect CPEC to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited . Conformal prediction provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model and ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability . CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool known as conformal prediction , providing accurate and FDR-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme . We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study , simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes . Machine learning ( ML ) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery . However , when applied to unseen situations , these models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives . We propose CPEC , an ML framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery .
[INTRODUCTION] There is often a trade-off regarding the size of the prediction set : researchers prefer a set with a small size , containing a handful of very confident predictions , as it is not desirable to spend resources on too many hypotheses that ultimately turn out to be false positives ; on the other hand , researchers may be willing to increase the budget to validate a larger set of predictions in order to improve the chance of discovering novel functions for under-studied proteins . While human experts can assess the success likelihood of generated hypotheses based on their domain knowledge or intuition , this ability is not naturally developed by an ML model and , as a result , the model could be susceptible to pathological failure and only provide overconfident or unreliable predictions . For example , in drug discovery , ML has become a popular strategy for virtual screening of molecule libraries , where researchers use ML models to predict the properties of molecules , such as binding affinity to a target , and identify the most promising candidates for downstream experimental validation and lead optimization . The base ML model of CPEC is PenLight2 , an improved version of the deep learning model PenLight for the multi-class multi-label protein function annotation problem , which uses a graph neural network to integrate 3D protein structure data and protein language model embeddings to learn structure-aware representations for function prediction . For example , to support the design of
[RESULTS] The risk in our conformal prediction framework is defined as the global average of per-protein FDRs , which may raise the concern that the overall FDR control achieved by CPEC on the test set was mainly contributed by FDR controls on those proteins that are easy to characterize and predict , and it is possible that the model suffered from pathological failures and did not give accurate FDR controls on proteins that are hard to predict . For comparison , we compared CPEC to several other thresholding
[DISCUSSION] In addition to protein function annotation , we expect CPEC to be a valuable tool for researchers in other biological discovery applications particularly when a balance between the experimental budget and the high yield rate is desired , such as drug target identification , material discovery , and virtual molecule screening . One limitation of the CPEC framework is that when under covariate shift ( i. e. , Pcalib ( X ) ≠ Ptest ( X ) ) , the data assumption of CPEC that the data in the calibration and test sets are i. i. d. is violated , which might lead to suboptimal FDR control performances ( S6 and S7 Figs ) . Although weighted conformal prediction frameworks have been proposed to address this limitation , the quantification and control of non-monotonic risk functions ( e. g. , FDR ) under covariate shift remained a challenging problem . The evaluation of CPEC on the EC number prediction task showed that CPEC provides reliable FDR control and has comparable or better prediction accuracy than baseline methods at a much lower FDR . In this work , we define the error rate as the false discovery rate ( FDR ) to reflect the practical consideration in experiments where the goal is to maximize the success rate of hypothesis validation given a limited test budget .
[METHODS] As false discovery rate ( FDR ) reflects how much proportion of the experimental validation of ML prediction results would be unsuccessful , it is directly related to the gains out of the wet lab experiments as opposed to the experimental costs , which is a tradeoff researchers often need to confront with . 5 ) , conformal prediction ( CP )",,971,97,None,"Machine learning ( ML ) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery .

[ABSTRACT] The heat shock responsive chaperone Hsp90 has been shown to interact with TDP-43 and stabilize its normal conformation ; however , it is not known whether this interaction contributes to neurotoxicity in vivo . Our data demonstrate for the first time that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS . Using a C. elegans model of fALS mutant TDP-43 proteinopathy , we find that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against TDP-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult animals . Aggregated , phosphorylated TDP-43 may contribute to disease phenotypes ; alternatively , TDP-43 aggregation may be a protective cellular response sequestering toxic protein away from the rest of the cell . Mutations in TARDBP , the gene coding for TDP-43 , can cause some cases of familial inherited ALS ( fALS ) , indicating dysfunction of TDP-43 drives disease . We also observe that the neuroprotective effect due to HSP-90 dysfunction does not involve direct regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans . We also find that hsp-90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress responsive heat shock pathway gene expression , including hsp-70 and hsp-16 . Neuronal inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 are hallmarks of disease for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . This protection is accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein . 1 are required for hsp-90 mutation effects on TDP-43 . 1 , and we demonstrate that normal levels of hsp-16 .
[INTRODUCTION] Under stress conditions , Hsp90 works together with the chaperone Hsp70 to form an essential part of the cellular quality control system and one of the main lines of defense against misfolded proteins through a co-chaperone-dependent process , including the co-chaperones STI-1/HOP and CHIP [ 16 , 31-33 ] . In contrast , another model of TDP-43 proteinopathy generated in human neuroblastoma cells found the knockdown of both Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones leads to an accumulation of toxic TDP-43 species , potentially by blocking the degradation pathways in which these chaperones are involved . Under stress conditions , perinuclear HSP-90 protects newly synthesized proteins from denaturation or from being degraded by the cell stress response in somatic cells ; moreover , this protective role against chronic proteotoxic stress functions as an integrated organismal response in a cell non-autonomous manner . In this study , we explore the role of the C. elegans hsp-90/daf-21 chaperone in an animal model of TDP-43 proteinopathy that expresses full length human TDP-43 containing ALS-causing mutations pan-neuronally . The vast majority of both sporadic and familial ALS-diagnosed cases ( about 97 % ) present inclusions containing the protein TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa ( TDP-43 ) in degenerating neurons , thus constituting the main pathological hallmark of the disease . ALS-associated TDP-43 accumulates as insoluble inclusions in neurons and other central nervous system cells , including microglia , astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes , thus contributing to neuronal dysfunction and interfering in myelin regeneration . Loss of motor neurons
[RESULTS] In order to evaluate how this protein homeostasis network may respond to altered HSP-90 function , we determined the mRNA levels of several elements of the heat shock response in the TDP-43 ( M337V ) ; hsp-90 ( p673 ) strain after a 24 hour shift to the restrictive temperature ( 25°C ) , including the Hsp90 clients hsf-1 , the major transcription factor for heat shock proteins , hsp-70 , an Hsp90 co-chaperone , the Hsp70 family member hsp-4/ HSPA5 , and the heat shock protein
[DISCUSSION] Consistent with the improvement in animal motility , our results show that dysfunction of the HSP-90 chaperone in TDP-43M337V ; hsp-90 ( p675 ) animals produces a neuroprotective effect on GABAergic motor neurons ( Fig 2A and 2B ) , an effect that we did not observe when animals were maintained at their growth temperature ( 16°C ) without inactivation of HSP-90 ( Fig 2C ) . In the present work , we have observed how genetic disruption of hsp-90 leads to an increase in hsp-70 mRNA levels ( Fig 5B ) , which could contribute to the neuroprotective effect in our model of fALS , although RNAi targeting hsp-70 did not modify hsp-90 loss of function impacts on TDP-43 phenotypes ( Fig 5P ) . In C. elegans , HSP-90 modulates proteostasis by sequestering HSF-1 , preventing it from raising the turnover of proteins , and protecting new and mature proteins from being degraded under physiological conditions ; however , when cells are under stress , HSP-90 is dissociated from HSF-1 in order to activate the heat shock response , which includes the upregulation of hsp-70 . Similar to our results , other studies have shown how , in response to an upregulation of heat shock proteins from the hsp-16 family , there is a suppression of toxicity in other neurodegenerative diseases with a protein accumulation component
[METHODS] F2 animals were singled and their progeny were examined to identify populations homozygous for both hTDP-43 transgenes ( as detected by 100 % population expression of the fluorescent reporter transgene Pmyo-2 : :dsRED ) and displaying the JT6130 phenotype ( 100 % Dauer arrest at 25°C ) . To assay GABAergic neuron loss in Day 1 adult worms , a subset of",,981,97,None,"ALS is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the gene coding for the protein TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa ( TDP-43 ) .

In this study , we show that loss of function of the heat shock responsive chaperone Hsp90 protects against TDP+43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult animals . We also find that hsp-90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress responsive heat shock pathway gene expression in C . elegans . Our data demonstrate for the first time that HSP-90 chaperon activity contributes to adverse outcomes in ALS proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS ."

[ABSTRACT] Additionally , we use the germ cells to explore gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis , highlighting its unique regulatory dynamics and allowing us to explore the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group . We map our data to the Fly Cell Atlas single-nucleus dataset of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary , shedding light on the conserved regulatory programs between the two distantly related Arthropod species . Our understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the Arthropod female reproductive system and the extent of their conservation is currently very limited . This is due to the focus on model systems , including Drosophila and Daphnia , which do not reflect the observed diversity of morphologies , reproductive modes , and sex chromosome systems . We use single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to produce a comprehensive single nucleus atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system . We identify the major cell types known to be present in the Artemia ovary , including germ cells , follicle cells , and ovarian muscle cells .
[INTRODUCTION] The presence of differentiated/heteromorphic sex chromosomes , such as the X and Y pair of mammals , introduces two challenges : First , X-linked genes are found in different copy numbers between males and females , which can cause imbalances in expression ; second , sequence similarity is usually required for successful synapsis and accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes , but is lacking over most of the length of the XY pair . Although an analysis in the water flea Daphnia , the closest model organism to Artemia , suggests the sequence conservation of many meiosis genes between insects and crustaceans , their conserved role in crustacean oogenesis and meiosis , and the transcriptional diversity/heterogeneity of cell types in the female reproductive system , have yet to be studied . While many aspects of oogenesis and female meiosis are highly conserved between distant species , there is considerable diversity in many others , including the presence/absence of nurse cells , meiotic chromosome pairing strategies , recombination rates , timing and duration of meiotic arrests , and sex chromosome specific regulation [ 1-3 ] . Despite our understanding of some of the pathways involved , many questions still surround the intrinsic and extrinsic signaling involved in oocyte differentiation , maturation and the resumption of meiosis after the long arrest , including their relative contribution , how they evolved in the first place , and how conserved they are across metazoans . Another study used single-cell RNA-seq in Drosophila miranda , which has the ancestral Drosophila X ( Muller element A ) , along with two younger X-linked
[RESULTS] To resolve the cellular heterogeneity in the Artemia female reproductive system and explore the unique regulatory programs and chromatin accessibility in the different cell types , we performed 10x single nucleus RNA sequencing experiments on two biological replicates of pooled ovaries from females kept with males ( and therefore putatively mated ) , and two replicates of 10x Multiome ATAC+Gene expression experiments on pooled ovaries from unmated females ( isolated in individual vials after birth to ensure that germ cells would not progress past metaphase I ) . After preliminary quality checks
[DISCUSSION] We used the same approach and percentile-based thresholds to check whether we see a similar pattern in the Drosophila testes dataset , and we only observe an enrichment in cells lacking dosage compensation in some of the germline clusters ( mainly in the meiotic and post-meiotic cell types ) , but no cells show extreme repression of the X chromosome ( S20 Fig ) . The fact that the reports of MSCI in Drosophila and chicken have been disputed later , and in many other species , such as moths and butterflies , the evidence so far suggests its absence , implies that the mechanism is either not as universal as initially assumed or that those species are exceptions to the rule . Our work also highlights single-nucleus RNA sequencing as a useful alternative to traditional approaches , such as epigenetic profiling and RNA-FISH , for identifying promising models for the study of meiotic sex chromosome regulation in species where it is difficult to isolate/identify nuclei of meiotic cells . More generally , broader sampling is needed to understand the role of the sex chromosome system ( female or male heterogamety ) , the extent of sex chromosome differentiation ( homomorphic or heteromorphic ) , the meiotic idiosyncrasies ( type of pairing and presence or absence of recombination ) , and repeat content/meiotic driver presence/activity in promoting the evolution of MSCI . It is important to note some limitations of
[METHODS] As the within cluster variation in the status of Z-chromosome expression is possibly driven by noise , we implemented more conservative thresholds that apply a 5 % false positive rate to the first category in each comparison to provide a noise-sensitive estimate of the cluster-specific enrichments ( S15 Fig ) : To ensure that our S0/Autosomal expression estimates are not affected by the low expression throughout",,940,95,None,"Insects and other arthropods have a wide range of reproductive systems , including the female reproductive system .

[ABSTRACT] These results suggest specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia , thus offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom . While the specific mechanisms remain unclear , allodynia is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory ( E-I ) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord . We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling so that excitatory neurons are `` released '' from inhibitory control , or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses so that excitatory neurons `` escape '' their inhibitory control . Which of these mechanisms is most likely to occur , the subcircuit components involved in the mechanism , and the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure . Chronic pain is a wide-spread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage , costing the United States alone around $ 600 billion in 2010 . By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions , we specify model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions . In this work , we analyze biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn . These circuits are hypothesized to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two different types of allodynia : static and dynamic . Then , we implement a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit 's E-I signaling . We use neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit . In a common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia , non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with highly variable presentations across individuals .
[INTRODUCTION] Solving this condition defines a hypersurface in the model parameter space , which we call the `` allodynia surface '' , that separates parameter sets for which the subcircuit generates healthy , allodynia-free responses for all typical Aβ inputs , vs responses where allodynia may be present , ( for at least some typical level of Aβ input ) . Here , we describe subcircuit motifs that reflect recent experimental evidence for the structure of dorsal horn laminae I-II networks mediating static allodynia ( as evoked by a von Frey device ) and dynamic allodynia ( Fig 1A ) . As such , our results identify the diverse ways by which excitatory and inhibitory components within the subcircuits combine and interact to maintain E-I balance , and characterize the sensitivity of these subcircuits to disruptions that can lead to pathological responses . Rodent experimental studies probing the mechanisms for dynamic allodynia have identified that it relies on the activity of laminae I-II SOM+ excitatory interneurons that do not express the calbindin 2/calretinin gene ( CR- ) . We begin by identifying the full space of model parameters that generate responses to Aβ signals that is correlated to healthy conditions in each subcircuit , i. e. low firing of the E or E2 populations . Additionally , inactivation of either dynorphin-positive ( DYN+ ) or parvalbumin-positive ( PV+ ) inhibitory interneurons is sufficient to produce static allodynia , suggesting
[RESULTS] While the I1 and I2 populations represent classes of inhibitory interneurons with different molecular markers ( DYN+ and PV+ , respectively ) , we assume they have similar response properties and use the same model parameters for each population . As in the simple circuit , we assume that the E population directly relays signals to projection neurons and allodynia is defined as any sustained firing of the E population in response to typical non-painful Aβ input . Our analysis shows that
[DISCUSSION] A limitation of the firing rate model formalism we implemented , which only models average population voltages and firing-rates , is that specific excitability characteristics or response features that are evident on the single neuron and spike levels may not be captured by the sigmoidal steady state firing rate activation functions . Continued experimental work identifying dorsal horn circuit structure and the functional relationships among diverse interneuron types will provide constraints necessary to improve models of spinal circuitry so that they can better participate in the development of therapies for this debilitating condition . 's finding that , in order to maintain healthy E-I balance , small reductions in inhibitory control of upstream excitatory populations required larger increases in inhibitory input to the downstream excitatory population suggests that perhaps their model parameter set may be analogous to Cluster 3 or 4 parameter sets in the dynamic subcircuit . Recent development of next-generation firing rate models that can be directly reduced from networks of individual neuron models provide the framework to include specific spiking patterns into a mean-field reduction , such as spike frequency adaptation . Such an extended model would be able to account for wind-up of projection neuron activity in response to repetitive brief C fiber input and also explicitly account for pain
[METHODS] Thus , we seek to solve this problem without computing an explicit representation of the target state surface S. Instead , we solve the higher dimensional problem ( g s * → n e a r e s t , f i n , n e a r e s t ) ≔ argmin ( g s → ,",,990,98,None,"Chronic pain is a common symptom of chronic pain that is debilitating and expensive to manage , costing the United States alone around $ 600 billion in 2010 .

[ABSTRACT] In contrast , yeast expressing different groups of Hsp90 mutations or a different cochaperone mutation had altered sensitivity to diphtheria toxin , which is dictated by a unique posttranslational modification on eEF2 . Our results provide further evidence that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not just by assisting protein folding , but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins . Further , mutations in yeast eEF2 that mimic disease-associated mutations in human eEF2 were negatively impacted by loss of Hgh1 and growth of one mutant was partially rescued by overexpression of Hgh1 . In addition , these results provide further evidence that yeast Hsp90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochaperones . We examined the requirement for Hsp90 and cochaperones more closely and found that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two distinct roles in regulating eEF2 function . eEF2 folding was recently shown to be dependent on Hsp90 as well as the cochaperones Hgh1 , Cns1 , and Cpr7 . The growth of Hsp90 mutants that affected eEF2 accumulation was also negatively affected by deletion of the gene encoding Hgh1 . Yeast expressing one group of Hsp90 mutations or one group of cochaperone mutations had reduced steady-state levels of eEF2 . Protein homeostasis relies on the accurate translation and folding of newly synthesized proteins . Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ( eEF2 ) promotes GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during translation .
[INTRODUCTION] We developed a series of yeast Hsp90 mutants , each with a single amino acid alteration in the Hsc82 isoform , that we grouped based on shared in vivo phenotypes and their ability to disrupt intermediate steps within the folding pathway . Mutations in human eEF2 result in nervous system abnormalities or developmental defects , including non-specific craniofacial dysmorphisms , abnormal brain morphology , and an autosomal dominant form of spinocerebellar ataxia . Many of the most studied Hsp90 mutants that have demonstrated defects in on activity of protein kinases and steroid hormone receptors fall into our 'loading and closing ' category . One of our goals is to identify differences in how clients interact with Hsp90 and cochaperones in order to provide insight into potential mechanisms of selective inhibition of Hsp90 function . Cryo-EM structures of Hsp90 and cochaperones in complex with GR demonstrate that each cochaperone makes direct contact with the GR , providing the basis for cochaperone-client selectivity [ 11-13 ] . However , evidence suggests GR and/or other clients may use a variety of mechanisms that include different cochaperones capable of targeting clients to Hsp90 [ 14-18 ] . Diphthamide is a modification of a histidine residue in eEF2 ( H699 in yeast ) , and it is the target of diphtheria toxin ( DT ) and other bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins . In contrast , sensitivity to diphtheria toxin is dependent on the Sti1 cochaperone and most sensitive to mutations in the loading and closing groups . The folding of eEF2 is
[RESULTS] As shown in Fig 4B , His-eEF2 WT and H699N accumulated to similar levels , consistent with a prior analysis , but the C372Y and P580H alterations resulted in significantly reduced levels of His-eEF2 , suggesting that misfolding of eEF2 contributes to the human disorders associated with these variants . To quantify the growth defects and minimize effects due to differences in the amount of cells struck out on the plate , colonies were picked from the 5-FOA plates in Fig 3A and 3B , grown overnight , normalized
[DISCUSSION] We showed that the yeast C372Y mutant , which corresponds to a de novo mutation in an individual with neurodevelopmental disorders , results in growth defects that were partially rescued by overexpression of HGH1 , suggesting that it may be possible to alleviate folding defects of some forms of mutated eEF2 . S2 Table summarizes our results , which suggest at least three possible fates of eEF2 upon alteration of Hsc82 : reduced accumulation with little or no impact on sensitivity to DT ( the reopening mutants ) ; reduced sensitivity to DT with some impact on steady-state levels ( loading and closing mutants ) ; or little or no effect on either accumulation or sensitivity to DT ( G424D , 'other ' ) . Our efforts to reproducibly detect and quantify differences in how Hsp90 mutation affects interaction with eEF2 or Hgh1 were unsuccessful , likely due to differences in the abundance of eEF2 , the transient nature of the of the interaction and/or background binding of Hsp90 to resin used during pulldown assays . Our hypothesis is that the mutated form of Utp21 is particularly reliant on the ability of Sti1 to load clients onto Hsp90 , and that the combination of two separate mutations that affect this process results in loss of the essential function of Utp21 in ribosome biogenesis . One possibility for the specific effect

[ABSTRACT] Thus , we examined participants with lesions in insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , key regions implicated in risky decision-making , as they played a gambling task where choices were made both alone and after observing others ' choices . It remains unknown how such decisions are made when these preferences are inaccessible or disrupted , as might be the case for individuals confronting novel options or experiencing cognitive impairment . These findings suggest that in social contexts , following others ' choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted . For socially situated decisions , these participants showed increased conformity with the choices of others , independent from social utility-based computations . When making risky choices in social contexts , humans typically combine social information with individual preferences about the options at stake . Participants in both lesion groups showed disrupted use of standard utility-based computations about risky options .
[INTRODUCTION] Thus , in situations where the structural or functional integrity of these regions is disrupted ( e. g. , in some neurological or psychiatric disorders ) or where insufficient information or differing abilities impose constraints , individual computations and decisions about risky options may be disrupted , leaving open the question of how socially informed decision-making occurs in those cases . Individuals with focal insula ( N = 10 ) or dACC lesions ( N = 6 ) and non-lesioned control participants ( NCs ; N = 28 ) made a series of choices between pairs of gambles alone ( 'Solo ' trials ) and after observing two others ' choices ( 'Info ' trials ; Fig 1A-1C ; task developed in our previous work ) . Recent studies indicate that when making socially situated choices , humans combine individual preferences for the options at stake with individual valuation of social information ; contributions from each of these determine when choices made in a social context diverge ( or not ) from that which one 's preferences outside a social context would predict [ 5-11 ] . Specifically , previous literature on decision-making in humans and non-human primates indicates that when individuals have a limited amount of private information , they tend to use various cognitive shortcuts or heuristics ( e. g. , mimicking other agents ) to simplify decision processes [ 13-16 ] . To examine this question , we administered a gambling task in both social and non-social contexts to individuals with focal insula or dACC lesions and tested models that measured the degree to which utility-based or heuristic-based processes
[RESULTS] Note that if an individual uses social information in a way that fully relies on other-conferred utility ( i. e. , ωutility = 1 ) , the mixture model prediction is equivalent to that of the original OCU model ; if an individual uses social information in a manner that is fully free from other-conferred utility ( OCU-free ; i. e. , ωfollow + ωoppose = 1 ) , their choices would be consistent with the simple heuristics of fully following or opposing those of social others , regardless of the gamble options .
[DISCUSSION] Third , we note that the perceptual 'copy when uncertain ' strategy has exceptions ( e. g. , ) and similarly , the use of a 'follow others ' choices ' heuristic may not be universally implemented in individuals for whom utility-based risk preferences may be disrupted , inaccessible , or otherwise not present ( e. g. , during substance misuse , individuals with certain psychopathologies , adolescents confronting novel options ) . While our primary findings are based on robust parameter estimates of heuristic processes within the Hybrid model , the model comparison analyses indicate that the Hybrid model alone is unlikely to capture the range of social influences on risky decision-making ; future studies are necessary to implement study designs that allow these processes to be detangled ( see S4 Fig for further discussion ) . We emphasize that the 'follow others ' choices ' heuristic identified in the current study is consistent with a 'copy-when-uncertain ' strategy previously demonstrated in perceptual decision-making , such that individuals are more likely to rely on the behaviors of others when they are less confident about their own decisions [ 34-36 ] . Lastly , we point out that the model comparison analyses indicate that the Hybrid model was not well dissociable from the OCU-based , OCU-free , and Solo RP models , perhaps due in part to the nested nature of these models or the presence of multiple overlapping processes during socially-situated decision making about
[METHODS] These 24 unique pairs of gambles ( one safer and one riskier gamble ) were used in each trial type ( Solo ; Info : 'safe ' ; Info : 'risky ' ; and Info : 'mix ' ) , so in total , each participant had 96 trials ( 4 lottery menus × 6 probabilities × 4 trial types ) .

[ABSTRACT] By using population genetics simulations , we demonstrate how moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently upon random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent . In particular , we find that biomorphs exhibit phenotype bias , a type of developmental bias where certain phenotypes can be many orders of magnitude more likely than others to appear through random mutations . This result , as well as many other patterns found in the structure of variation for the biomorphs , such as high mutational robustness and a positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness , closely resemble findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps . Such bias towards simplicity is formalised by an information-theoretic principle that can be intuitively understood from a picture of evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms . We postulate that the phenotype bias towards simplicity and other patterns biomorphs share with molecular genotype-phenotype maps may hold more widely for developmental systems . Biomorphs , Richard Dawkins 's iconic model of morphological evolution , are traditionally used to demonstrate the power of natural selection to generate biological order from random mutations . Many of these patterns can be explained with an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome . Here we show that biomorphs can also be used to illustrate how developmental bias shapes adaptive evolutionary outcomes . Moreover , this bias exhibits a strong preference for simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity .
[INTRODUCTION] For example , phenotype bias towards simplicity can explain key patterns in nature such as an observed strong preference for symmetry in protein complexes , and the fact that the most frequent RNA secondary structures found in nature have structures that are highly compressible , and therefore are simple with low descriptional complexity K ˜ ( p ) . The mechanisms by which strong phenotype bias is predicted to influence adaptive evolutionary outcomes includes the `` arrival-of-the-frequent '' effect , which captures the simple fact that natural selection can only act on the structures that are introduced sufficiently frequently into the population through random mutations , see also . In RNA especially , detailed quantitative comparisons are possible : For example , if the secondary structures are coarse-grained using level-5 of the RNAshapes method , then the 68 evolved secondary structures of length L = 126 found in the RNAcentral database of functional RNA are among the 96 structures with highest phenotypic frequencies out of a much larger set of 1012 topologically possible level 5 structures . The main aim of this paper will be to analyze the generation of phenotypic variation more systematically in this system and test the hypothesis that this iconic model of morphological development also exhibits simplicity bias and other phenomena similar to those observed for molecular GP maps . Next , we turn to a scenario that is adapted from refs and includes both variation and selection : Two adaptive phenotypic changes are possible and for a range
[RESULTS] To help quantify these structural features , we use a random null model from ref where the neutral set sizes of each phenotype are kept fixed , but the individual assignments of the genotypes to phenotypes are randomized . Having analyzed what the GP map can tell us about the phenotypic effect of mutations in general , we next investigate how this structure in the arrival of variation affects an evolving population . Modeling evolving populations requires us to make assumptions about the way in which fitness depends
[DISCUSSION] Indeed , phenotypic changes observed in phylogenies of angiosperm leaf shapes tend to be strongly biased towards simpler phenotypes and experiments on developmental pathways for mouse teeth suggest that mutations leading to simpler tooth shapes are more common than those that lead to increased tooth complexity because the latter scenario requires a coordinated change in several pathways . If simplicity bias in GP maps follows from very general intuitions based on the algorithmic infinite monkey theorem , as formalised by AIT , then we might expect it to hold for a much wider range of GP maps than have been studied so far . The same is true for the biomorphs GP map : when we restrict the value of the ninth gene to a constant ( section E in S1 Text ) , the sequence constraints in the analytic model are the same for every genotype and phenotype , but the computational data still displays variations in neutral set sizes , complexities , robustness and evolvability . Our analytic calculations reveal one key reason for the similarities between the GP map of biomorphs with that of molecular structures : the analytic model falls into the same class of sequence-constraint-based models that have been used to explain universal behavior observed in molecular GP maps . Even if the probability that a particular individual phenotype appears upon random mutations
[METHODS] This construction is performed in two steps ( Fig 2 and Algorithm 1 ) : first , a set of eight vectors is constructed from the genotypic information and then these vectors are combined recursively to form the final figure , as described in : In order to exhaustively analyze the GP map computationally , we restrict the values in the genotypes",,961,96,None,"Biomorphs , Richard Dawkins’s iconic model of morphological evolution , are traditionally used to demonstrate the power of natural selection to generate biological order from random mutations .

This bias exhibits a strong preference for simpler structures with low descriptional complexity . By using population genetics simulations we demonstrate how moderately adaptive variation that appears more frequently upon random mutation can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotics that are less frequent .

[ABSTRACT] This human sensitivity to resonance has been experimentally supported for interactions with simple linear systems but remains a challenge to validate in more complex scenarios where nonlinear dynamics can not be predicted analytically . Even for increased task accuracy ( Experiment 2 ) and targets located away from the NNM ( Experiment 3 ) , participants could successfully accomplish the task , likely by adjusting their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics to better align the resonant motions to the task . Our findings emphasize the human capabilities to apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions , including possibly shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness . In all tested experiment variations , participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems . In a user study consisting of three experiment parts , participants commanded differently configured virtual double pendula with joint compliance through a haptic joystick . The task was to alternately hit two targets , which were either aligned with the NNM ( Experiments 1 and 2 ) or purposefully arranged offset ( Experiment 3 ) . Activities like ball bouncing and trampoline jumping showcase the human ability to intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that the system prefers intrinsically . Using this tool , the present resarch compared the motions that humans excite in nonlinear systems with the predicted NNM of the energy-conservative systems . However , it has been found that many nonlinear systems exhibit periodic orbits similar to the eigenmodes of linear systems . Consequently , our experiments extend the existing research on human resonance sensitivity with data-based evidence to nonlinear systems . These nonlinear normal modes ( NNM ) are computable with a recently developed numerical mode tool .
[INTRODUCTION] We can easily handle countless different objects , even when they are complex in shape , flexible in material , have multiple degrees of freedom ( DOFs ) , or exhibit highly nonlinear or even chaotic dynamic behavior . Instead , periodicity in chaotic systems can be found and stabilized through phase synchronization , but multiple possible periodic orbits make it hard to predict which solutions emerge in human interactions . Hence , BL2 commanded a sine wave at a frequency much lower than the predicted NNM frequencies such that motor link speed synchronizes with both pendulum links and avoids spring deflections . Everyday examples showcase human intuitive resonance sensitivity : without conscious effort , humans induce oscillatory motions when jumping on a trampoline or bouncing a ball by tuning to the intrinsic system dynamics . A cup balancing experiment showed that participants always chose similar starting positions to initialize the task , proving that humans can get an intuitive feeling even of complex nonlinear system dynamics . It was expected that the pendulum motions in the experiment would not congruently match the ideal NNM path , since the NNM computation can only be performed for energy-conservative systems . Yet , NNMs allow us to predict intrinsically preferred motions for conservative nonlinear systems on defined energy levels computable with a mode tool developed by our group . It is likely that the Central Nervous System ( CNS ) also employs chaotic control to explore system dynamics and tune into intrinsic motion patterns to
[RESULTS] To test this hypothesis , the original participant data is also compared with the recomputed NNM of an alternative P45 pendulum with k1 = 6 N m rad−1 , for which the turning points of the NNM are within or at least close to the target locations . However , the mode metric of the participants and BL1-3 indicate that the excited pendulum motion had a much larger distance from the ideal NNM trajectory , which was expected since the targets were not located on the turning points
[DISCUSSION] Although interactions with more system variations should be investigated in the future , the experiments highlighted the fundamental importance of resonance for humans and their capabilities to excite it . For the first time , the presented research could provide data-based evidence that human resonance sensitivity extends to object interactions with nonlinear dynamics . The contribution of this research is twofold : first , we introduced methods that expand analysis options for human interactions with nonlinear systems . Therefore , this research contributes to identifying underlying mechanisms driving human motion planning and control , especially during the excitation of periodic motions . Second , the findings advance existing insights about human motor control strategies and their flexible adaptation to best suit a given task .

[ABSTRACT] Genetic analysis of the relationship between the three transcription factors indicate that all are necessary to limit pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced . TSRs influence numerous developmental processes including the decision between biofilm formation and motility , genetic competence , and sporulation , but the extent to which TSRs influence bacterial physiology remains to be fully elucidated . Similarly , expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC was found to be under control of ScoC , AbrB , and PchR and correlated with the amount of pulcherrimin produced by each background . Here , we demonstrate two TSRs , ScoC and AbrB , along with the MarR-family transcription factor PchR negatively regulate production of the iron chelator pulcherrimin in B. subtilis . Gene expression in cells transitioning from exponential phase to stationary phase is under the control of a group of transcription factors called transition state regulators ( TSRs ) . Regulation of transcription is a fundamental process that allows bacteria to respond to external stimuli with appropriate timing and magnitude of response . Lastly , our in vitro data indicate a weak direct role for ScoC in controlling pulcherrimin production along with AbrB and PchR . In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis , transcriptional regulation is at the core of developmental processes needed for cell survival . The layered regulation by two distinct regulatory systems underscores the important role for pulcherrimin in B. subtilis physiology .
[INTRODUCTION] This phase , termed the transition state , is where cells in the population use environmental cues to inform the next course of action to survive in the new environment , specifically whether to engage in competence , biofilm formation , motility , secondary metabolism , and/or acquisition of nutrients . Pulcherrimin biosynthesis is negatively regulated by the MarR-family transcription factor PchR , which is found in a cluster of two divergently transcribed gene-pairs encoding pulcherrimin biosynthesis ( yvmC and cypX ) , regulation and transporter ( pchR and yvmA ) ( Fig 1B ) . We explore the kinetics of pulcherrimin production throughout the transition state and found that ScoC , AbrB , and PchR control the timing , rate , and amount of pulcherrimin produced by modulating expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthetic gene cluster yvmC-cypX . We further establish the roles of PchR and AbrB in direct regulation of gene expression utilizing in vitro DNA binding assays and provide evidence that ScoC can bind directly to the yvmC promoter in vitro . Additionally , the ability of pulcherriminic acid to strongly sequester iron contributes to its anti-oxidative effects by limiting Fenton chemistry , providing evidence as an important antioxidant in cells . Together our results establish a model where pulcherrimin biosynthesis is regulated by nutrient levels during the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase in addition to input from PchR , linking stationary phase with extracellular iron sequestration . Microarray analysis between WT and scoC mutants identified 560 genes with differential
[RESULTS] However , whether there are differences in the amount , or even the rate at which pulcherrimin is produced , is not easily determined with qualitative comparisons , necessitating a quantitative assessment of pulcherrimin production during different growth phases ( see below ) . In the triple mutant background , pulcherrimin production began at the first sampled timepoint , six hours before the transition into stationary phase , demonstrating all transcription factors contribute to inhibiting expression during exponential phase ( Fig 3A and 3Bi ) . We therefore
[DISCUSSION] While expression patterns of yvmC-GFP promoter fusion closely resembled the pattern of pulcherrimin production , the reporter in the scoC : :erm and abrB : :kan background displayed broad distributions of promoter expression , suggesting the TSRs influence heterogeneity in pulcherrimin producing cells . Thus , control by ROS and TSRs agrees with an antioxidant role for pulcherrimin wherein intracellular and extracellular iron is sequestered as cells enter stationary phase , limiting proliferation of reactive oxygen species . While no small ligand has been identified as an allosteric regulator of PchR activity , He and colleagues have identified ROS as a signal that alleviates DNA binding by PchR in Bacillus licheniformis . A neighboring MarR-family transcription factor YvnA was also identified as a regulator of pulcherrimin biosynthesis in B. licheniformis , where it bound directly to the intergenic region between yvmA and yvmC . Interestingly , the abrB deletion had a larger effect on maximum pulcherrimin production in B. licheniformis than in B. subtilis , indicating that despite similar regulatory components , their effects appear species specific . One possibility is that the different genetic organizations of the pulcherrimin biosynthetic gene cassette may necessitate alternative forms of regulation , thus explaining the difference between B. licheniformis and B. subtilis . Microarray analysis of the effect of scoC on global gene expression was carried out from cells sampled at different

[ABSTRACT] When we investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic TMS at two frequencies applied at or below T10 , the model replicated the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that has been observed clinically : low-frequency TMS ( 1 Hz ) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI , whereas high-frequency TMS ( 30 Hz ) enhanced urine storage . Neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons , beyond what is necessary to simulate normal bladder function , must be present in order to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition , and both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms whereby TMS reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI . We defined , within a mathematical model , the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after a SCI and incorporated into this model the minimum additional neurophysiological features sufficient to replicate the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS of the spine in patients with SCI . We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI , and we increased the density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a more diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of spinal interneurons that remains after SCI . DSD and incontinence reflect the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle , which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination , and urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles , which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit bladder emptying . After spinal cord injuries ( SCIs ) , patients may develop either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) or urinary incontinence , depending on the level of the spinal injury . We created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations that replicated normal bladder function . Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced DSD and incontinence . The model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI .
[INTRODUCTION] Once the simplified model controlling micturition under normal , uninjured circumstances was constructed , we introduced the minimum number of additional , novel features needed to create a single , unified model with a fixed network architecture that reproduced observations both before and after SCI and with and without TMS applied to the lumbar spine . Muscle dynamics have been described by Hill equations ( which describe the activation of muscles controlling the bladder in terms of muscle length , tension , and velocity of shortening ) , but neural elements were represented by static models , such as the weighted sum of inputs operating around a threshold or a logical on/off switch . Many patients with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) above the lumbar spine lose voluntary control of bladder function , either partially or entirely , and develop a neurogenic bladder , which manifests as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) -a lack of coordination between the detrusor and sphincter muscles that prevents effective bladder emptying . Last , a model based on what might be described as weighted logic gates to simulate excitatory or inhibitory neurons within the circuit of micturition control produced on/off reflex responses that simulated normal urine storage and micturition . In either case , the models were based on mechanistic descriptions of physiological processes that incorporated the smallest set of neural or biochemical features needed
[RESULTS] Since excitatory Nodes 1 and 3 were inactive during 1 Hz stimulation , the infantile , spinal voiding reflex was activated in the absence of descending inhibition from the PSC acting through Nodes 3 and 6 , which permitted detrusor activation based on afferent information directed to Node 7 and then efferent activation of detrusor contraction through parasympathetic preganglionic neurons ( Node 10 , Fig 5C2 ) . This sequence of coordinated external sphincter relaxation and persistent detrusor activation occurred
[DISCUSSION] Insights from this modeling illustrate how an integrated , systems-level modeling approach can advance the understanding of neural dysfunction , which is essential to determine the neuronal basis of adverse effects of SCI so that rehabilitation and neuromodulation may be used to ameliorate the neurological disorders following SCI . The effect of TMS at the network level was analyzed through model simulations , which revealed possible mechanisms underlying the amelioration of the detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia by TMS and the mechanism whereby low ( but not high ) frequency TMS was effective for this purpose . A model of the neural circuits was developed by building on a state-of-the-art model to capture the normal storage/voiding functions under healthy conditions and typical disorders of the bladder after SCI , such as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and overactivity of the bladder . We developed a basic framework for model-based analyses of neural circuits controlling micturition after SCI and of the effects of TMS on the spinal cord as a therapeutic intervention to alleviate bladder dysfunction following SCI . The effect of TMS on the spinal cord was modeled at the single-cell level based on recent experimental findings from patch-clamp and extracellular recordings .

[ABSTRACT] Our model outperformed reference models at fitting to and predicting OD600 growth curves and overcame observed discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD600 versus directly measured data in reference models that did not include calibration . In this paper , we propose a mathematical model of fungal growth to estimate morphology-specific growth rates from easy-to-collect , but indirect , optical density ( OD600 ) data of Aspergillus fumigatus growth ( filamentous fungus ) . Our method accounts for OD600 being an indirect measure by explicitly including the relationship between the indirect OD600 measurements and the calibrating true fungal growth in the model . However , automated large-scale collection of such data lies beyond the scope of most clinical microbiology laboratories . Current methods quantify fungal growth rates from time-course morphology-specific data , such as hyphal length data . Therefore , the method does not require de novo generation of calibration data . Quantifying fungal growth underpins our ability to effectively treat severe fungal infections .
[INTRODUCTION] The current standards for antifungal susceptibility testing for filamentous fungi , set by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) and the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing ( EUCAST ) , involve evaluating minimum inhibitory/fungicidal/effective concentrations ( MIC/MFC/MEC ) in vitro [ 13-15 ] , which is the minimum drug concentration required to reduce or alter the morphology of fungal biomass within a certain time [ 15-18 ] . However , to the best of our knowledge , estimating morphology-specific growth rates and developing mechanistic models of dynamic filamentous fungal growth are not routine in clinical microbiology laboratories potentially because it is too difficult to quickly collect the required time-course data that encapsulates morphological information or directly measures dynamic fungal growth . However , all these approaches to estimate growth rates from OD , both empirically or using modelling , harbour intrinsic inaccuracies because OD is an indirect measure of growth whereby changes in OD measurements may not even be reflective of true fungal growth and changes in fungal morphology are generally overlooked . In this paper , we aim to model filamentous fungal growth and estimate morphology-specific fungal growth rates from OD measured at a wavelength of 600nm ( OD600 ) without collecting calibration data but still taking into consideration that OD is an indirect measure of growth . These direct data collection methods are only feasible for large-scale experimentation in specialist research microbiology laboratories because of the high cost of technologies and skill-level required to perform automated direct measurement of fungal growth . Collecting OD data is an automated , quick , and popular method to
[RESULTS] Our model also demonstrated lower RMSE and relative LPD compared to other reference models that did not incorporate calibration and were directly fit to OD600 , including a Gompertz and Gaussian Process ( GP ) model that are popular parametric and non-parametric models used in OD modelling literature [ 34 , 38-41 ] , respectively ( Fig 4 , reference models without calibration ) . Given that our Logistic-OD-calibration model could fit to all the collected OD600 data and could predict held-out OD600 data during CV better than the reference models , we next
[DISCUSSION] However , none of these models can be reused to estimate growth rates of filamentous fungi from OD because all the models either require OD data that has been pre-processed using collected calibration data or the models are directly fit to OD , with one study even highlighting OD calibration as a problem when estimating growth rates . In summary , this study proposed a mathematical model to infer a biologically interpretable and morphology-specific fungal growth rate from indirect OD600 data without the need for collecting calibration data and , hence , is accessible to all microbiology laboratories that collect OD600 data , rather than just specialist laboratories . Methods have already been proposed to accelerate Bayesian inference of large-scale models whose linear transform is the only observed output , which would facilitate estimation of fungal growth rates should the expansion of our model dramatically increase computation time . However , we anticipate that modelling a nonlinear calibration curve whilst retaining a parametric model would make key parameters of interest ( e. g. fungal growth rates ) difficult to infer because large differences in the parameter values may no longer correspond to measurable differences in observed OD . However , investigating time- and morphology-specific antifungal modes of action using mechanistic modelling or estimating growth rates is currently hampered in clinical microbiology laboratories by arduous methodologies reliant upon sophisticated technologies . Another study proposed predicting microbial growth curves from OD by fitting population growth models

[ABSTRACT] We generated a whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confusum , which has a neo-sex chromosome , and utilize eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera . These neo-sex chromosomes evolve the stereotypical properties of sex chromosomes , including the evolution of dosage compensation and a non-random distribution of genes with sex-biased expression . Beetles thus provide a novel model to gain a better understanding of the diverse forces driving sex chromosome evolution . Most species have XY sex chromosomes , but X0 sex determination mechanisms are also common in some groups . While the ancestral X chromosome is maintained across beetles , we find independent additions of autosomes to the ancestral sex chromosomes . We identify ancestral linkage groups , termed Stevens elements , that share a conserved set of genes across beetles . Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes .
[INTRODUCTION] In addition , we collect RNA-seq data from different tissues to explore functional changes on the more recently formed neo-sex chromosomes in T. confusum and Dendroctonus ponderosae , allowing us to explore the evolutionary trajectory of young sex chromosomes in beetles . In particular , we generate a new chromosome-level assembly for Tribolium confusum and use published assemblies from eleven additional species spanning across the phylogeny , to broadly reconstruct sex chromosome and karyotype evolution in beetles ( Fig 1 ) . For example , Diptera generally have XY sex chromosomes , but genomic analysis revealed tremendous hidden diversity in sex chromosome karyotypes among flies , with numerous transitions of sex chromosomes , or incorporations of autosomes into the ancestral sex chromosome . In particular , information on sex determination is available for over 4500 beetle species , and 93 % of species reported show genetic sex determination ( 17 % are X0 and 75 % have XY sex chromosomes ) . XY sex chromosomes typically undergo synapsis during meiosis and can recombine in their pseudoautosomal region in males ( but note that achiasmatic male meiosis has evolved in some groups ) . In response to Y degeneration , mechanisms may evolve to balance reduced transcript levels of hemizygous X-linked genes in males and equalize transcript levels in males and females from the X and the autosomes ( i. e. dosage compensation ) . The X chromosome appears to be conserved in some beetles [ 10-12 ] but this has not been explored rigorously using broad phylogenetic sampling . Cytogenetic analysis has shown that most species harbor X and Y chromosomes , but X0 sex determination is also common among some groups . Sex chromosomes originated from initially homologous chromosomes , and Y chromosomes degenerate due to their lack of recombination
[DISCUSSION] An abundance of beetles and further development of genomic and functional tools will make Coleoptera a valuable model system to study the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary forces driving the differentiation of sex chromosomes across taxa . Our broad phylogenetic sampling of beetles suggests that they will be a promising model to study patterns of karyotype evolution , and evolutionary forces operating on sex chromosomes . We find that the ancestral X is conserved in Coleoptera , but identify multiple independent formations of neo-sex chromosomes , even among closely related beetle species . We show that ancestral linkage groups are maintained across beetles which allows the study of karyotype evolution at the molecular level .
[METHODS] Our initial analysis of P. japonica revealed that the assembly deposited in GENBANK was not consistent with the publication and so we re-scaffolded with the published Hi-C data and created our own more conservative linkage groups ( S5 Fig ) . We then removed non-target sequence from the assembly by running BLAST on all contigs < 1 Mb ( n = 158 contigs , median = 10 kb ) against the nt database and",,703,84,None,"Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes .

[ABSTRACT] To explore this possibility , we generated mRNA transcript profiles for wild-type , htz1Δ , swr1Δ , and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea ( HU ) , which induces DNA replication stress . Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure , and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes . Z , encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in S. cerevisiae , is an evolutionarily conserved H2A histone variant that is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR1-complex ( SWR1-C ) . We also observed that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant , particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation . Z enrichment at transcription start sites was correlated with , but generally not required for , the upregulation of genes during HU exposure . However , given that growth defects of htz1Δ mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SWR1-C subunits , previous work examining the role of H2A . Z has often been implicated in transcription regulation , htz1Δ mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type . Z in gene expression regulation may be confounded by deleterious activity caused by SWR1-C when missing its H2A . Z mutants only display significant growth defects in genotoxic stress conditions , a more substantive role for H2A . Chromatin structure and DNA accessibility are partly modulated by the incorporation of histone variants . Z in gene expression may only be uncovered after exposure to cellular stress . Z incorporation before and after treatment with HU revealed that decreases in H2A . Together this study characterized the regulatory effects of H2A . Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to HU . Our data showed that H2A . Z substrate ( apo-SWR1-C ) . Furthermore , as H2A . Furthermore , mapping H2A . While H2A . H2A .
[INTRODUCTION] Given the growth phenotypes associated with this phenomenon are highly pronounced in HU , HU exposure could also serve as a valuable means to determine if the htz1Δ mutant 's gene expression patterns are influenced by the presence of apo-SWR1-C. By increasing the cellular abundance of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and disrupting the production of deoxyribonucleotides ( dNTPs ) , HU activity ultimately leads to cell cycle arrest and DNA damage checkpoint activation [ 44-46 ] . We also observed that both the swr1Δ and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants had less severe gene expression defects compared to the htz1Δ mutant , particularly for genes involved in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis . Z incorporation has been widely connected to human health and disease including memory formation [ 4-8 ] , development and progression of various cancers [ 9-14 ] , and phenotypes of the rare genetic developmental disorder Floating Harbor Syndrome . Z incorporation is required for proper cell cycle progression , we hypothesized that HU exposure would exacerbate gene expression differences in htz1Δ mutants and could clarify the relationship between H2A . However , microarray experiments in budding yeast have challenged this notion , finding that less than 5 % of genes are differentially expressed in the htz1Δ mutant in steady-state conditions despite H2A . Z has been implicated in a large variety of biological functions including nucleosome turnover , maintenance of heterochromatin and euchromatin boundaries , DNA repair
[RESULTS] Altogether these results suggested that , while minimal , there are robust observable differences in gene expression profiles between the htz1Δ mutant and wild-type that can be partially explained by the deleterious effects of apo-SWR1-C. To characterize the impact of HU exposure on gene expression , we employed DESeq2 to identify differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) between the wild-type untreated and HU-treated conditions ( S3A-S3C Fig ) . RT-qPCR analysis of representative genes from each of these three categories showed that the
[DISCUSSION] For instance , in addition to depleting dNTP pools , HU exposure increases the production of reactive oxidative species , stalls replication forks , and increases the number of transcription-replication conflicts [ 44-46 ] , events that all have the potential to disrupt proper chromatin assembly and therefore increase widespread promiscuous transcriptional activity across the genome . Therefore it is likely that results from previous microarray analysis , which found an equal number of upregulated and downregulated genes in the htz1Δ mutant , are largely the consequence of using steady-state experimental conditions [ 18 , 22 , 36-38 ] . Z may be involved in the rapid transcriptional reprogramming necessary for cells to adapt to the introduction of cellular stress , which would not be immediately evident when evaluating bulk mRNA levels 90 minutes after a gene is induced . Therefore , while several of the identified DEGs were specific to each genotype , which is consistent with previous work , our results suggest that a shared set of genes were dysregulated across each mutant , differing only in the severity of the expression defect . For example , HUG1 , a ribonucleotide reductase ( RNR ) inhibitor that is highly upregulated upon DNA replication stress , exhibited lower transcript levels in the HU-treated condition in
[METHODS] The normalization factor for each sample was determined using the average library sizes of the cleaned raw read counts for both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe in the untreated condition : Variance ( σ2 ) between biological replicates for each strain in each condition was visualized by grouping genes based on wild-type expression levels ( TPM ) in either",,989,98,None,"Chromatin structure and DNA accessibility are partly modulated by the incorporation of histone variants .

[ABSTRACT] Overall our findings show how hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies can help solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles , interestingly these methods rely on a much less stringent type of annotated datasets compared to fully supervised learning methods . The partial label learning framework assumes that we can obtain a set of candidate labels containing the correct one for each data point , a simpler setting than requiring a fully supervised training dataset . We study and extend when needed state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods , such as SVM , kNN , prototype-based , logistic regression and ensemble methods , to the partial label learning framework . An important current question is how to classify transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNASeq experiments into the various cell types and identify the lineage relationship for individual cells . We show , on simulated and real datasets , that these extensions enable to learn from partially labeled data , and perform predictions with high accuracy , particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method . Because of the fast accumulation of datasets and the high dimensionality of the data , it has become challenging to explore and annotate single-cell transcriptomic profiles by hand . Finally , we study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data , and derive some prescriptive results on the effect of this uncertainty on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods . However , due to the difficulty of obtaining data annotated at single-cell resolution , we propose instead to take advantage of partial annotations . We demonstrate that the performances of our methods trained with partially annotated data reach the same performance as fully supervised data . Single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNASeq ) data plays a major role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology . We focus particularly on the hierarchical structure of the labels , as commonly observed in developmental processes . Moreover , we study the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods . To overcome this challenge , automated classification methods are needed . Classical approaches rely on supervised training datasets .
[INTRODUCTION] The second class of applications concerns the situation where a reference atlas exists , providing sufficient information for establishing sets of candidate labels for each transcriptomic profile , but not sufficient for a single-cell resolution annotation ( because of time , cost , and computational limitations ) . We will investigate and compare several methods from various families of approaches to solve our classification problems on biological data : a SVM-based approach ( e. g. ) , a prototype-based approach originally inspired from , a kNN-based approach , logistic regression and ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting Methods . The main remaining limitations come from the fact that transcriptomic profiles do not usually contain temporal and precise spatial information , and manual annotation of individual cell profiles can be tedious , time-consuming and require expert knowledge . Yet the research in this area has mainly focused on specific application contexts for these data , large-scale problems ( in the number of classes and in the number of data ) [ 28-32 ] , hierarchical multilabel classification , discovery of a hierarchy underlying the data . While maximum margin methods ( e. g. SVM ) are a powerful solution to such a partial labeling setting , we will investigate prototype-based methods , nearest neighbor , logistic regression and ensemble methods as well to provide a comparative study of a
[RESULTS] Moreover , we found that the PB-nn method with hierarchy significantly outperformed all other methods ( SVM and kNN in this experiment ) in 25 cases among all the 48 experimental settings ( 52 % of the time ) and more generally the PB family of methods ( flat , hierarchical , linear and nonlinear ) significantly outperforms all other methods in 30 cases which represents 62 % of the cases . Because of the relatively smaller size of the
[DISCUSSION] In conclusion , the flexibility and adaptability of the partial label learning framework is a key step in making transcriptomic single-cell data annotation easier and the corresponding prediction even more routinely used to interrogate the nature of the mechanisms underlying cell differentiation . In an era where transcriptomic data is being generated increasingly , being able to automatize more and with less expert knowledge the task of automatic cell type classification is highly relevant , as the quality of the annotation is currently the bottleneck . Because we showed that the highest performing partially labeled classifier is a nonlinear Prototype-Based method , we understand that the relationship between cell type identity and position in the feature space is not a linear function . Similarly , we could be using tissue level information which is at scale high than cellular by nature and use all of the cell types expected in this tissue as a candidate label set . Our results , showing that we can perform multiclass classification with high accuracy on partially labeled data can be associated to the fact that transcriptomic datasets are highly structured and lie on a low dimensional manifold . Similarly , recent experimental assays have led to combining multiple -omics , automated classification
[METHODS] On the one hand , we investigated the use of models that do not require full training at every iteration but which may be iteratively refined along iterations ( with algorithm 1-IRL ) , this includes all models that are trained with an iterative algorithm ( e. g. gradient descent ) such as prototype-based methods ( taking",,1018,99,None,"Single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNASeq ) data plays a major role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology .

[ABSTRACT] Our results show for the first time that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) associates with PIP2 in the RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions , and that altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein . Thus , we propose that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins and affects their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation . We found that intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins . In this study , we unveiled the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) nuclear proteome in human cells by mass spectrometry . Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) is found in nuclear speckles , nucleoli , and nuclear lipid islets and is involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription . This suggests the pivotal role of PIP2 in the establishment of a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression . The RNA content is crucial for the formation of nuclear compartments , such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli . Moreover , these IDRs of RDPA proteins exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation , acetylation , and ubiquitination sites . We therefore investigated whether PIP2 and RNA cooperate in the establishment of nuclear architecture . Intriguingly , the nuclear localization of PIP2 was also shown to be RNA-dependent .
[INTRODUCTION] In addition , biomolecular condensates allow the sequential progression of processes through the successive coupling of subsequent reactions in multilayered compartmentalized reaction chambers , such as ribosomal biogenesis in nucleoli , packaging of hnRNP particles in Cajal bodies , or the involvement of nuclear speckles in pre-mRNA splicing [ 17 , 27-29 ] . Stickers are local modules that allow multivalent intra- and intermolecular interactions and are represented by classical globular domains of proteins or by stretches of charged amino acids connected by flexible linker regions in intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) . Taken together , our data demonstrated the formation of a specific type of biomolecular condensates via the association of complexes formed by RNA , proteins , and PIP2 , and are therefore relevant to our understanding of the principles underlying the establishment of functional nuclear compartments . Therefore , we used bacterial RNase III , normally associated with siRNA processing , to remove short dsRNA regions followed by quantitative mass spectrometry ( MS ) proteomic analysis of the nuclear fraction . In addition , it has been previously described that changes in net charge and amino acid types within an IDR can even navigate proteins to different core regions . The phase separation-driven formation of membraneless compartments , sometimes referred to as 'biomolecular condensates ' , is associated with enhanced kinetics of biochemical reactions in the living cell [ 22-25 ] . Our results suggest a molecular mechanism in which PIP2 acts as a molecular wedge for the recruitment of the lysin/arginine ( K/R ) motif-containing RDPA protein BRD4 by higher-order RNA molecules . Interestingly , nuclear compartments
[DISCUSSION] We used the Database of Disordered Protein Predictions , and all nine different IDR predictors showed a similar bimodal distribution pattern of IDRs ( only IDRs with a minimum length of 20 amino acid residues were considered ) based on their pI ( Figs 2D , S6 and S7A ) . In contrast , we observed an increased association of BRD4 with the PLC PH domain-conjugated beads in nuclear lysate pull-downs compared to the condition without RNA addition , suggesting that dextran may function similarly to RNA in enhancing BRD4 association with PIP2-containing complexes ( Fig 4B ) . To further test the specific effect of RNA on BRD4 protein , we set up an experiment where we added the same amount of purified recombinant GST-tagged GST-PLCδ1 PH or its mutant variant R40A domains to the nuclear lysate as internal controls . To assess the abundance of PIPs binding domains in the RDPA proteome , we generated in parallel several reference datasets by analyzing the nuclear and cytosolic fractions isolated from the same HeLa cell line using the same LC-MS/MS proteomic pipeline ( see M & M section for more details ) . These data are consistent with the previously observed effect of RNA on the condensation capacity of BRD4 in vitro and suggest that both higher-order RNA and nuclear PIP2 must be in fine balance to ensure that the correct number of BRD4 foci is formed . Based on these data , we hypothesize
[METHODS] To test the specificity of the effect of RNA on PIP2 binding of BRD4 protein the addition of 30 μg of nuclear RNA extract and 1 μg of purified recombinant soluble GST-PLCδ1 PH domain ( 1-140 amino acids , wild type or R40A mutation ) , were used in the respective specimens in experiments `` PIP2-conjugated agarose beads pull-down assays from nuclear lysates with added nuclear RNA",,894,93,None,"The RNA content is crucial for the establishment of nuclear compartments , such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli .

[ABSTRACT] Our work highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits , demonstrates gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals , and provides new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental , ecological , and evolutionary studies of this insect group . We then contrast chromatin accessibility in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females and identify distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development , including a large proportion of recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn morph determination . The Scarabaeinae , or true dung beetles , are a species-rich clade of insects recognized for their highly diversified nutrition-responsive development including that of cephalic horns-evolutionarily novel , secondary sexual weapons that exhibit remarkable intra- and interspecific variation . Phenotypic plasticity is thought to be an important driver of diversification and adaptation to environmental variation , yet the genomic mechanisms mediating plastic trait development and evolution remain poorly understood . Comparing these assemblies to those of seven other species across the order Coleoptera identifies evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis . We begin by presenting chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species in the tribe Onthophagini including Onthophagus taurus , O. sagittarius , and Digitonthophagus gazella . Here , we investigate the evolutionary basis for horns as well as other key dung beetle traits via comparative genomic and developmental assays . Binding motifs of known and new candidate transcription factors are enriched in these nutrition-responsive open chromatin regions .
[INTRODUCTION] We chose these three species because collectively they embody a remarkable diversity in head horn development reflective of much of the diversity contained within the clade , including : a highly exaggerated sexual dimorphism and male polyphenism in O. taurus ; a rare example of sex-reversed horn development in O. sagittarius females paralleled by a secondary loss of horn polyphenism in males ; and a modest sexual dimorphism and male polyphenism in the more distantly related D. gazella thought to reflect ancestral character states ( Fig 1B ) . Furthermore , due to their diversity , abundance , pronounced environment-sensitive development , and unique feeding and reproductive traits , dung beetles have thus long served as important models for behavioral ( e. g. status dependent selection and sperm competition models ) , developmental ( e. g. mechanisms of plasticity ) , evolutionary ( e. g. the origins of evolutionary novelties ) , and ecological studies ( e. g. meta-population theory , nutrient recycling , soil aeration ) . In the case of dung beetles , nutrition-responsive development is a flexible developmental response to variable and limited larval food quality and quantity , resulting in a wide range of adult body sizes , which in turn has fueled the evolution of alternative , body size-dependent morphological , physiological , and behavioral phenotypes . In polyphenic species , larval nutrition channels male development toward one of two alternate , and discretely different ontogenetic outcomes : fully horned major males ( which as adults engage in aggressive combat to secure matings ) or smaller-sized , nearly fully
[DISCUSSION] Comparing our findings on head horns to that of other diversified structures with established homology ( such as ventral appendages or thoracic beetle horns ) alongside other novel structures ( such as butterfly wing spots or firefly lanterns ) will be informative for understanding if the patterns of cis-regulatory evolution identified here are symptomatic for the early stages of morphological innovation in evolution . Chromatin configuration assays suggest alternative forms of intraspecific horn variation ( sexual dimorphism vs. nutritional plasticity ) are instructed by discrete regulatory architectures , a conclusion corroborated by two independent pieces of support : 1 ) largely distinct sex- and nutrition-responsive head horn OCRs ; and 2 ) a disproportionate amount of OCRs that are nutrition- , but not sex- , responsive and only found in the O. taurus genome . Lacking homology to other body parts may have promoted , permitted , or alternatively limited head horn development to the inclusion of novel regulatory interactions into gene networks due to the lack of pre-existing mechanisms that could be co-opted , and/or to minimize developmental constraint arising from pleiotropy . In contrast to legs , antennae , and mouthparts ( which are all serial homologs of ventral appendages ) and thoracic horns ( which have recently been identified as wing serial homologs ) , head horns appear to be unique elaborations of the dorsal head , and sufficiently individuated to have undergone remarkable
[METHODS] While the transcription start site would normally be a more appropriate genomic reference for assigning OCRs to nearby coding sequence , annotation of these features is currently not sufficient for every gene in the O. taurus genome , so the translation start site was instead chosen as a shared reference point among all gene models .

[ABSTRACT] Using a cynomolgus monkey model of Lassa virus ( LASV ) infection reproducing the different outcomes of the disease , we performed histological and transcriptomic studies to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death . The pathogenesis of Lassa fever has not yet been fully deciphered , particularly as concerns the mechanisms determining whether acute infection is controlled or leads to catastrophic illness and death . Lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever , with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome . By contrast , the systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types , leading to infiltrations with macrophages and neutrophils and an excessive inflammatory response , is associated with a fatal outcome . However , subsequent viral tropism varies considerably with disease severity , with viral dissemination limited almost entirely to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever . These results provide new insight into early viral dynamics and the host response to LASV infection according to disease outcome .
[INTRODUCTION] LASV displays no significant further spread in surviving animals , whereas systemic viral dissemination and replication is observed in animals with fatal disease , leading to a cytokine/chemokine storm and multiple organ failure closely resembling that observed in septic shock syndrome . As both patient access and the handling of LASV patient samples are very limited , animal models are crucial to understand the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and the events enabling some patients to control LASV and leading to catastrophic illness and death in others . LASV is transmitted to humans through contact with its natural reservoir , the peridomestic rodent Mastomys natalensis , or material contaminated with the excreta of these rodents , but alternative reservoirs have also been described . The replication of LASV in SLOs is followed by systemic dissemination to almost all organs during severe Lassa fever in cynomolgus monkeys , whereas the spread of the virus appears to be restricted to a few organs in surviving animals . Here , we further analyzed the dynamics and tropism of these two strains of LASV in these animals , to shed light on the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and the immune mechanisms associated with the different outcomes . Facial and/or neck edema , conjunctivitis , hemorrhages , neurological signs , and acute respiratory distress are then observed in patients with severe disease , and death occurs in a context of multiorgan failure . LASV has a preferential tropism for antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) , dendritic cells and macrophages , potentially accounting for the rapid transfer of the virus from site of
[RESULTS] For monocyte-derived genes , only samples obtained from Josiah-infected animals presented significant changes in gene expression , with a decrease in the expression of TFEC , CD302 , HNMT , SLC11A1 , and TIMP2 and an increase in mRNA levels for IFNGR2 , TNFSF13 , SERPINA1 , PILRA , CFP , TYMP , NOD2 , FCRGR2 , LYN , FRS , FGR , TLR4 , LY75 , TEXAS1 , and HCK .

[DISCUSSION] However , both strains are probably able to infected endothelial cells , as we previously showed that Mopeia virus , an Old-World arenavirus closely related to LASV , and AV LASV infect human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) with similar replication kinetics and high titers of virus released in the supernatant . We show here that the synthesis of mRNAs related to the type I IFN response , cytokines and chemokines , and to coagulation pathways is induced in both infected and bystander hepatocytes in Josiah-infected animals and that this expression is also observed in hepatocytes from AV-infected animals even without the infection of these cells . However , we think that this discrepancy with natural infection does not alter the course of infection , as lungs rapidly became targeted with the virus and similar pathological changes and viral tropism was reported in LASV-infected cynomolgus monkeys infected using aerosol route . The aim of this study was to characterize in more detail the dynamics of the pathogenesis and immune responses associated with survival or death from LF in a cynomolgus monkey model in which infection with AV LASV leads to non-lethal disease whereas infection with Josiah LASV results in death . The moderate but significant increase in cortisol levels in Josiah-infected animals probably reflects a stress response to infection and suggests that , despite the massive viral replication occurring in the adrenal glands , there are probably

[ABSTRACT] Pathological disruption of Nucleocytoplasmic Transport ( NCT ) , such as the mis-localization of nuclear pore complex proteins ( Nups ) , nuclear transport receptors , Ran-GTPase , and RanGAP1 , are seen in both animal models and in familial and sporadic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTD\FTLD ) , and Alzheimer 's and Alzheimer 's Related Dementias ( AD/ADRD ) . Our convergent results between mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cellular biology provide mechanistic evidence that many of the mis-localized proteins and dysregulated transcriptional events seen in multiple neurodegenerative diseases may in fact arise primarily from a primary upstream defect in Importin- β nuclear import . First , taking advantage of two novel mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration ( NemfR86S and NemfR487G ) that recapitulate many cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases , we find an Importin-β-specific nuclear import block . However , the question of whether these alterations represent a primary cause , or a downstream consequence of disease is unclear , and what upstream factors may account for these defects are unknown . Lastly , we show that even transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in our mouse models and in neurodegeneration . Second , we observe cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of multiple proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD , including TDP43 , Importin-β , RanGap1 , and Ran . These findings have critical implications for investigating how sporadic forms of neurodegeneration may arise from presently unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importin-β function . Here , we report four key findings that shed light on the upstream causal role of Importin-β-specific nuclear transport defects in disease onset . These findings are further supported by a pathological interaction between Importin-β and the mutant NEMFR86S protein in cytoplasmic accumulations . Third , we identify similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease .
[INTRODUCTION] The RQC is recruited to stalled translation events [ 25-29 ] , where NEMF plays a crucial role in targeting partially translated nascent chain polypeptides ( NCPs ) on the 60S ribosome for proteasomal degradation [ 24 , 28 , 30-33 ] . These stalled translational events are most commonly a result of premature polyadenylation , where a poly ( A ) tail is inserted into the open reading frame resulting in the translation of lysine-AAA codons [ 26 , 28 , 29 , 38-40 ] . In this study , we have demonstrated that the mutant mouse model , NemfR86S , exhibits impaired nuclear import of proteins containing canonical nuclear localization signals ( cNLS ) , consequently leading to defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport both in vitro and in vivo . Remarkably , the downregulation of Stmn2 observed in our Nemf mutant-mouse model can be reproduced through the transient induction of a nuclear import block in both murine and human cells using a small molecular antagonist of Importin-β , importazole . Pathological disruption of NCT , such as the mis-localization of Nuclear Pore Complex proteins ( Nups ) , NTRs , and Ran-GTPase , are seen in both animal models and in familial and sporadic forms of ALS , FTD , and AD/ADRD [ 9-16 ] . These two mouse lines carrying homozygous mutations in NemfR86S/R86S and NemfR487G/R487G , henceforth NemfR86S and NemfR487G , show progressive
[RESULTS] To investigate the mechanism by which the missense Nemf mutation in mice led to an age-dependent neurodegenerative phenotype associated with motor deficits , we immunostained transverse lumbar spinal cords of wild type and NemfR86S homozygous mutant mice at 21 days ( NemfR86S median lifespan : 20 days ) . Using Apoe and Stmn2 dysregulation as a marker for transcriptional dysregulation , we targeted Nemf and Ltn1 by siRNA knockdown in WT and NemfR86S ( S2 Fig ) and saw that Nemf
[DISCUSSION] We have demonstrated that there is a direct impact of Importin-β nuclear import dysregulation on multiple phenotypes seen in neurodegeneration through the following : ( 1 ) NEMF-specific dysregulation of Importin-β nuclear import ( but not of Transportin-1 import ) , ( 2 ) mis-localization and aggregation of NEMF , TDP43 , Ran , RanGAP1 and Importin-β , ( 3 ) amyloid-like aggregation , ( 4 ) PLA cytoplasmic association between NEMF R86S and Importin-β , ( 5 ) cytoplasmic accumulation of NEMF , Importin-β , and TDP43 in Nemf mutant mouse spinal cord , ( 6 ) transient Importin-β-specific nuclear import blockage knockdown recapitulates these transcriptional alterations ( 7 ) and upregulation of Importin-β can partially rescue these transcriptional alterations . This ability to inhibit and reverse both physiological and deleterious phase transitions has been implicated in multiple forms of neurodegenerative diseases , wherein RNA-binding proteins or Prion-like domains are lost from the nucleus and accumulate in the cytoplasm [ 69-77 ] . Altogether , this suggests that Importin-β 's function as both a nuclear import receptor and cytoplasmic chaperone is disturbed in this NemfR86S model , wherein the protein is sequestered away from its typical function , and that we can recapitulate many of these in vivo alterations through transient

[ABSTRACT] The described temporal modulation of the phage epigenome is valuable for synthetic biology and fundamental research to comprehend phage infection mechanisms through the generation of mutants . This approach enables precise DNA targeting and seamless point mutation integration , exemplified by deactivating specific ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection . Our study utilizes the eukaryotic enzyme NgTET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications , facilitating Cas nuclease cleavage and enhancing mutagenesis efficiency . Furthermore , by temporally removing DNA modifications , we elucidated the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections without necessitating gene deletions . Our results present a strategy enabling the investigation of phage epigenome functions and streamlining the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications . However , phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through extensive DNA modifications like cytosine glycosylation , hindering mutagenesis efficiency . CRISPR-Cas systems offer a way to explore these mechanisms via site-specific phage mutagenesis . Lytic bacteriophages hold substantial promise in medical and biotechnological applications . Therefore a comprehensive understanding of phage infection mechanisms is crucial .
[INTRODUCTION] In this study , we apply a eukaryotic ten-eleven translocation ( TET ) methylcytosine dioxygenase to temporally reduce the abundance of 5ghmdC within the phage T4 genome to enable the specific and efficient targeting of phage DNA with CRISPR-Cas . However , this does not apply to lytic phages , as their genetic material exists separately from the host genome within bacterial cells and undergoes rapid replication during a limited time of infection . However , the application of the CRISPR-Cas-based phage mutagenesis on the model phages , such as phage T4 , has revealed an overall low mutagenesis efficiency ( 0-3 % ) and being strongly dependent on the spacer selected for the mutagenesis [ 15-17 ] . Particularly in phages with complex genomes , like phage T4 , which has numerous overlapping genes and gene splicing arrangements , targeted mutagenesis is crucial to avoid unintended effects on other genes ' expression . The enzyme deoxycytidylate 5-hydroxymethyltransferase ( gene 42 ) originating from T4 phage catalyzes the conversion of 2´-deoxycytidine 5´-monophosphate ( dCMP ) into 5-hydroxymethyl-2´-deoxycytidine 5´-monophosphate , which is subsequently converted to into 5-hydroxymethyl-2´-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and incorporated into T4 DNA during replication ( further referred to as 5hmdC ) . However , its effectiveness depends on the successful co-transformation of both phage DNA and donor DNA into the same cell , which might be limited by the host 's transformation efficiency or the phage genome size . These advantages collectively position this technique as a valuable tool in synthetic biology and biotechnology for creating `` designer phages '' as well as in fundamental research to explore the
[RESULTS] Therefore , given the widespread presence of homologous DNA modifiers among phages and the potential of NgTET treatment demonstrated in this study on phage T4 DNA-both for investigating the role of DNA modifications and for efficient phage mutagenesis-the application of NgTET could be expanded to other phages . Combining the mutagenesis with ONT screening , we determined that CRISPR-Cas9 and Cas12-based mutagenesis in the absence of NgTET did not result in the introduction of point mutations for all tested CRISPR-Cas systems , spacers , and targeted genes ( Table 1 ) . During
[DISCUSSION] Consequently , a strategy analogous to that employed in the current study , in which NgTET was pre-expressed in order to generate a protein which is stable during phage infection and to ensure reduction of the abundance of phage DNA modifications , could be employed with recombination systems . Taken together , the field of bacteriophage epigenetics remains widely unexplored and , therefore , represents an intriguing subject for future research , providing the opportunity to gain profound insights into the ongoing arms race between bacteria and bacteriophages . Moreover , the phage mutagenesis efficiency of up to 6 % reported in this study , combined with the ONT-based high-throughput screening method , simplifies the detection of the point mutations within the phage genome , thereby reducing the need to screen large phage populations . To potentially increase the efficiency and rate of homologous recombination after Cas nuclease targeting of phage DNA , incorporating heterologous recombination systems into the mutagenesis strain on plasmid and pre-expressing the recombination proteins before the mutagenesis process could be beneficial . This approach avoids additional genomic changes associated with reporter gene insertion and the potential drawbacks on phage DNA packaging , allowing for the efficient , scarless introduction of point mutations into the phage genome . While the DNA accessibility is difficult to predict , the efficiency of the homologous recombination can be strongly limited due to the degradation of donor DNA plasmids at an early stage

[ABSTRACT] Bulky DNA lesions , such as those induced by UV light or the DNA-damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline oxide , act as transcriptional and replicational roadblocks and thus represent a major threat to cell metabolism . When located on the transcribed strand of active genes , these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair ( TC-NER ) , a yet incompletely understood NER sub-pathway . Z , repair by TC-NER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance reduced , leading to an increase in double-strand breaks . The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication . Z is needed for proficient TC-NER and plays a major role in the maintenance of genome stability upon UV irradiation . A manifold of mechanisms act in concert to ensure adequate DNA repair , gene expression , and genome stability . Here , using a genetic screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we identified histone variant H2A .

[INTRODUCTION] Among the repair pathways , nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) is a versatile repair pathway capable of removing a large variety of structurally unrelated lesions such as UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers ( CPDs ) and pyrimidone 6-4 photoproducts , X-ray induced cyclopurines or adducts induced by chemicals such as 4-nitroquinoline oxide ( 4-NQO ) , benzo [ a ] pyrene , N-acetoxy-2-actylaminofluorene , psoralens , etc . In TC-NER , stalling of the elongating RNAP at the DNA damage promptly triggers the repair reaction on the transcribed strand ( TS ) of active genes while in GG-NER , a specialized DNA damage recognition complex-which consists of Rad7 , Rad16 and Elc1 in budding yeast-improves the detection of the helix-distorting DNA lesions throughout the genome . With the aim at identifying new TC-NER factors to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of this repair pathway , we screened the non-essential deletion strain collection from S. cerevisiae for mutations leading to increased sensitivity to 4-NQO . Recent works have shown that the Elf1/ELOF1 transcription elongation factor functions in TC-NER both in yeast and human cells , where it promotes the recruitment and assembly of further repair factors [ 11-13 ] . In eukaryotes , the human Cockayne 's syndrome protein B ( CSB ) and its yeast homolog Rad26 are among the first proteins to act at DNA damage-stalled RNAPII and contribute to the recruitment of further repair factors . Transcription-blocking lesions are mainly repaired by transcription-coupled NER ( TC-NER ) , which differs from global genome NER ( GG-NER ) in the lesion recognition step
[RESULTS] Because conflicts between the transcription and replication processes have emerged as a major source of genome instability and our results suggest that RNAPII might remain trapped on DNA in UV-irradiated htz1Δ cells , we decided to analyze recombination in a reporter system based on two truncated leu2 direct repeats positioned either in a co-directional or head-on orientation with respect to replication ( Fig 3B ) . In wild-type cells , the percentage of cells with DSB repair centers rose up to over 40 % two hours after UV irradiation and went down
[DISCUSSION] This data can reflect either that RNAPIIs accumulate at the 5'-UTR due to defective TC-NER and recovery of transcription elongation , or that UV-dependent degradation of promoter-bound RNAPIIs-a critical pathway to avoid DNA-damage induced transcription stress -does not take place correctly in the absence of histone variant H2A . Z incorporation in the vicinity of RNAPII stalled at DNA lesions promotes efficient TC-NER repair by establishing a repair-favorable chromatin environment and , thus , preventing the accumulation of chromatin-bound RNAPII that could cause conflicts with the replication machinery in UV challenged cells ( S4 Fig ) . Z-enriched chromatin , which enhances DNA accessibility , could facilitate repair either by increasing the surface available for interaction with NER proteins or by promoting the action of specific factors that would fuel repair . Z incorporation by the SWR1 complex in response to UV damage , as Htz1 relative enrichment increases upon UV irradiation throughout RPB2 and that swr1Δ , htz1Δ and swr1Δ htz1Δ cells are equally sensitive to UV in a GG-NER deficient background . Even though further investigation would be required to discriminate between these possibilities , the persistence of chromatin-bound RNAPIIs is predicted to lead to increased TRCs which may challenge genome stability . Another example is provided by the chromatin-reorganizing FACT ( facilitates chromatin transcription ) complex , which is required for the resolution of TRCs that are mediated by R-loops and for proficient TC-NER in human
[METHODS] Individual transformants were grown to early-log-phase in SD-Leu , irradiated in SD medium lacking amino acids with 50 J/m2 UV-C light ( BS03 UV irradiation chamber ; Dr. Gröbel UV-Elektronik GmbH ) , the medium supplemented with amino acids and cells incubated at 30°C in the dark for recovery .

[ABSTRACT] Despite there being highly variable regulatory architecture , this observation was robust across tissues and genetic backgrounds , suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence and yielding new insights into cis and trans regulatory evolution . To address this question , we analyzed gene expression in the midgut , hindgut , and Malpighian tubule as well as microbiome composition in the two gut tissues in four Drosophila melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from two divergent populations : one from the derived , European range and one from the ancestral , African range . This gene expression variation is context dependent , with differences in regulatory architecture often associated with intrinsic and environmental factors , and is modulated by regulatory elements that can act in cis ( linked ) or in trans ( unlinked ) relative to the genes they affect . An examination of allele specific expression revealed that , while both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes expressed differentially between populations than genes with conserved expression , trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects . So far , little is known about how this genetic variation affects the evolution of regulatory architecture among closely related tissues during population divergence . Tissue-specific effects were typically stronger than genetic background-specific effects , although the two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules . In both the transcriptome and microbiome data , we detected extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects , including effects of genetic background on overall tissue specificity . The pervasiveness of gene expression variation and its contribution to phenotypic variation and evolution is well known .
[INTRODUCTION] At the DNA sequence level , genetically heritable variants can modulate expression in two general ways : cis-regulatory variants , such as those within enhancers or promoters , affect the expression of linked , nearby genes , while trans-regulatory variants , such as those affecting transcription factors or regulatory RNAs , affect the expression of unlinked genes that can be located anywhere in the genome ( reviewed in [ 13-14 ] ) . However , deviations from this pattern of regulatory variation have been documented in Drosophila [ 20-23 ] as well as other species [ 24-25 ] , which underscores that there remains much to learn about the evolution of gene expression regulation , especially over short evolutionary distances . To investigate the effect of natural genetic variation from divergent populations on regulatory architecture in multiple functionally related , interconnected tissues , we analyzed messenger RNA-sequencing ( mRNA-seq ) data of midgut , hindgut , and Malpighian tubule tissues in four D. melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids . The excretory system is involved in waste excretion as well as ionic- and osmoregulation , while the digestive tract is an important modulator of food intake , nutrient absorption , energy homeostasis , and insulin secretion that can shape physiology and behavior through its interaction with the microbiome .

[RESULTS] In order to understand how the mode of expression inheritance varies among genotypes and tissues , we categorized genes according to their expression in the two parental strains and the respective F1 hybrid into the following categories ( see Methods for more details ) : similar , P1 dominant , P2 dominant , additive , overdominant , and underdominant , with the Swedish strains being P1 and the Zambian strains P2 ( Fig 3 ; S2 and S3 Tables ) . Of the 4 ,
[DISCUSSION] When we examined divergence in gene expression and phenotypic dominance ( i. e. the cumulative differences in each trait across all analyzed genes ) , we found that divergence was higher among than within tissues ( Figs 2C and 3D ) , suggesting that although both are pervasive , tissue-specific effects outnumber or are larger than genetic background-specific effects , and these effects may be magnified when considering the phenotypic dominance of gene expression , as our findings suggest that it is much less conserved than expression itself . However , we should note that the tissues we examined in this study , and the midgut in particular , are known to be regionalized [ 37-38 , 40 ] with an estimated 22 , 4 , and 5 distinct cell types currently described in the midgut , hindgut , and Malpighian tubules , respectively [ 49-50 ] ; therefore , it is possible that we may have missed some of the more subtle differences in gene regulation that occur among individual regions or cell types . The endosymbiont Wolbachia , which is known to affect microbiome composition but is not present in the gut lumen , was predominant in all of our samples ( S9 Fig ) but we did not detect the very common Lactobacillus ( Fig 6 )
[METHODS] We tested for differences in allelic expression using a negative binomial test as implemented in DESeq2 , using only genes with a minimum of 15 diagnostic reads for each allele replicate , resulting in a total of 5 , 060-5 , 590 , 5 , 650-6 , 141 , 5 , 097-5 , 133 , and 4 , 035-4 ,",,976,97,None,"The pervasiveness of gene expression variation and its contribution to phenotypic variation and evolution is well known .

[ABSTRACT] We then apply our model using data on Alpha variant infections in the UK , dating the first Alpha infection at ( median ) August 21 , 2020 ( 95 % interpercentile range across retained simulations ( IPR ) : July 23-September 5 , 2020 ) . Our population dynamics-based modelling framework is generic and flexible , and thus can be applied to estimate the starting time of outbreaks in contexts other than COVID-19 . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic , previous studies have estimated dates of emergence ( e. g. , first human SARS-CoV-2 infection , emergence of the Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant ) using mainly genomic data . While the first infection of an emerging disease is often unknown , information on early cases can be used to date it . Here , we extend this approach to use a larger set of early reported cases to estimate the delay from first infection to the Nth case . Next , we apply our model to data on COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before mid-January 2020 . Another dating attempt used a stochastic population dynamics approach and the date of the first reported case . We date the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan at ( median ) November 28 , 2019 . Our results fall within ranges previously estimated by studies relying on genomic data . We first validate our framework by running our model on simulated data .
[INTRODUCTION] Another study , based on case data only , used a stochastic non-Markovian approach relying on mortality data to estimate the date of SARS-CoV-2 introduction to France ; the first COVID-19 wave was estimated to have been initiated mid-January 2020 in France . Various attempts have been made to date the first human infections by SARS-CoV-2 that led to the COVID-19 pandemic ( noting that earlier spillovers , leading to dead-ends , may have occurred ) , using case data and/or viral genomic data . Some have used molecular clock analyses relying on genomic data to determine the time of most recent common ancestor ( tMRCA ; providing an upper bound for the time of the first infection , see Fig 1 ) of lineages introduced in a focal country . Beyond the early transmission of a new pathogen , estimating the date of first infection is also of interest while studying the initiations of local clusters in naïve populations , such as when the pathogen is first introduced to a new location , but also when the pathogen evolves to distinct genotypes such as emerging variants of concern ( VOCs ) . Another , earlier , modeling study used case data only and dated the first COVID-19 case between early October and mid-November 2019 , by adapting a technique used in conservation science for dating extinction using observation events . Genomic analyses on their own are usually insufficient to estimate the time of the first infections : the tMRCA does not necessarily approximate the
[RESULTS] Our simulations yield an estimated median number of days between the 1st SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case recorded of 52 ( 95 % IPR : 41-78 ) days , dating the emergence ( i. e. , the first sustained human infection ) of SARS-CoV-2 to November 28 ( 95 % IPR : November 2-December 9 ) , 2019 , and not earlier than September 26 , 2019 . Here , we evaluate the impact of uncertainty around the main model parameters on the results ,
[DISCUSSION] Second , our model requires early estimates of the distributions for key epidemiological indicators such as the mean number of secondary infections , the secondary infection generation time , the probability of case detection and the incubation period , which depend themselves on the quality of early observed data and may not be available for new emerging infectious diseases . This may not reflect early epidemic dynamics , where public outbreak alerts may provoke , on the one hand , an increase in testing efforts and thus , rapid changes in the probability of detection and , on the other hand , changes in individual behaviors that may impact the probability of disease transmission and thus , the expected number of secondary infections . For instance , our approach shows that early SARS-CoV-2 infections of the transmission chain that was first detected at Wuhan 's Huanan market remained undetected for between about a week and three weeks before the first case of symptomatic COVID-19 was observed and reported . Quantifying the time that emerging epidemics remain undetected before detecting the first cases is particularly important in the context of emergent pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 , where very early cases may remain unidentified , especially if a high proportion of the infections are asymptomatic . Here , we built our model in a parsimonious , generic and flexible manner intended to
[METHODS] Note that while the Nth case is a stopping criterion of our model , our analyses still deal with all M ≥ N cases occurring up to the end of day dK : the number of infections detected on day k is defined by Y k ≡ ∑ j = 1 M 1 d k ≤ τ j < d k + 1",,956,96,None,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic , previous studies have estimated dates of emergence ( e . g . first human SARS-CoV-2 infection , emergence of the Alpha SARS–CoV2 variant ) using mainly genomic data .

[ABSTRACT] Incorporating natural chromosome lengths , the model accurately recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast , and can be adapted to nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets of other organisms . Mechanisms that ensure stable homolog alignment in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes have remained elusive , but rapid chromosome movements appear to play a role in the process . Apart from homolog attraction , provided by early intermediates of homologous recombination , dissociation of non-homologous associations also appears to contribute to homolog pairing , as suggested by the detection of stable non-homologous chromosome associations in pairing-defective mutants . Dissociation of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes may contribute to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited nuclear area thus creating preconditions for close-range homolog attraction . Chromosome number and size as well as movement velocity and repulsive forces are identified as key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing in addition to homolog attraction . The model simulates unidirectional chromosome movements , as well as collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces arising from close-range physical interactions . During meiosis , pairing of homologous chromosomes ( homologs ) ensures the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells , a prerequisite for sexual reproduction . Here , we have developed an agent-based model for homolog pairing derived from the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble . Pairing during meiotic prophase I facilitates crossover recombination and homolog segregation during the ensuing reductional cell division .
[INTRODUCTION] Cytoplasmic motor proteins , actin in budding yeast and the dynein-microtubule complex in most other organisms , mediate nuclear chromosome movements due to the attachment of their ends via the conserved SUN-KASH protein complex where SUN proteins interact with chromosome ends and reach across the inner nuclear envelope whereas KASH proteins span the outer nuclear envelope providing a link between SUN proteins and the cytoplasmic filaments [ 14-17 ] . Rather than making assumptions about pairing dynamics along individual chromosomes , we use differential equations based on first principles that govern the movements of chromosomes as an outcome of interactions with all other chromosomes within the same nucleus . Several mathematical models have examined potential contributions of molecular processes to homolog pairing , including telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope , chromosome bending stiffness , and polymer chains exhibiting an excluded volume repulsive potential [ 18 , 20-23 ] . While homologs in somatic cells tend to occupy nuclear areas more distant than expected , somatic pairing nevertheless underlies important biological processes , including X chromosome inactivation and association of loci affected by genomic imprinting . Homologous chromosomes are considered as paired once they have associated at a distance less than or equal to 400 nm , corresponding to the distance between co-aligned homolog axes in absence of the SC . Here , we have developed an agent-based model ( ABM ) , in which movements and interactions between individual chromosomes ( i. e. agents ) are simulated , thereby recapitulating the
[RESULTS] ( iii ) While the model places unpaired chromosomes randomly on an idealized two-dimensional nuclear area , the experimental `` area '' is created through spreading and/or squashing of a three-dimensional cell in an imperfectly controlled manner potentially compressing homologs that are separated along the z-axes , a complication experimentally addressed via comparison with cells harboring GFP signals on non-homologous chromosomes . ( ii ) Moreover , prior to entry into meiosis , homologs are paired somatically in G1-arrested cells , potentially as a special case of
[DISCUSSION] Accordingly , the frequency of non-homologous interactions is reduced and crowding of homologous chromosomes into the same nuclear area occurs at low frequencies when chromosomes are present in lower numbers , exhibit smaller sizes or fail to achieve unidirectional movement due to disturbance by Brownian motion . To explore contributions to the pairing process of the entire nuclear chromosome ensemble , we have developed an agent-based mathematical model derived from first principles that takes into account both attractive forces between homologs and dissociative forces between non-homologous chromosomes ( see Methods section ) . Importantly , involvement of a single protein complex in homologous strand exchange and dissociation of non-homologous chromosome interactions is consistent with both forces acting upon the same molecular intermediate , most likely displacement loops between DNA segments with extensive or limited sequence similarity , respectively . In summary , the modeling approach developed here suggests that homolog pairing is achieved by two mechanistically distinct , yet temporally coinciding processes : Homologs become confined to a nuclear area due to dissociation of interactions with the entire non-homologous chromosome set achieved via a repulsive force . Other extensions of our model might include chromosome-size dependent velocities , and temporary changes in effective nuclear volume , as in the case of directed chromosome movements during the horsetail stage in S. pombe where the entire chromosome complement temporarily
[METHODS] A Morse potential is defined as a difference of Yukawa potential energies , assigning to homologous chromosome pairs a weak attractive ( i. e. associative ) force strength Ca ( blue ring in Fig 1A ; here ℓa = 400 nm ) and a weak repulsive ( i. e. excluded volume ) force strength Cr1 acting at very short distances and ensuring",,968,97,None,"During meiosis , homologous chromosomes ( homologs ) ensure the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells , a prerequisite for sexual reproduction .

[ABSTRACT] Interestingly , miR-34 triple-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development , but the lack of miR-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds . DNA damage by camptothecin led to p53-dependent induction of miR-34 genes , while miR-34a mutants were adult-viable and had normal DNA damage-induced apoptosis . Nevertheless , miR-34a-/- compound mutants with a gain-of-function tp53R217H/ R217H or tp53-/- mutants were more cancer-prone than tp53 mutants alone , confirming the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a . Through transcriptomic comparisons at 28 hours post-fertilization ( hpf ) , we characterized DNA damage-induced transcription , and at 8 , 28 and 72 hpf we determined potential miR-34a-regulated genes . Overexpression of miR-34a suppressed its reporter mRNA , but not p53 target induction , and sensitized injected embryos to camptothecin but not to γ-irradiation . At 72 hpf , loss of miR-34a enhanced erythrocyte levels and up-regulated myb-positive hematopoietic stem cells . Zebrafish miR-34a and miR-34b/c have similar expression timing in development , but miR-34a is more abundant . Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by inherited TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations . miR-34 genes are highly conserved and syntenic between zebrafish and humans . MicroRNA miR-34a is a p53 target and modifier gene .
[INTRODUCTION] Navarro and Lieberman challenged the simple positive miR-34a-p53 feedback model by showing that about a quarter of p53 target genes are direct targets of miR-34a , that both miR-34a and p53 have independent functions , and that a lack of miR-34a in human cells did not affect the p53 response . miR-34a is also a known p53 pathway modifier in LFS , where TP53 missense mutations were strongly associated with MIR34A promoter hypermethylation in tumors compared to the surrounding healthy tissue ; this hypermethylation was associated with a poorer prognosis in choroid plexus carcinoma patients . The mouse Adenomatous Polyposis Coli ( APC ) mutant intestinal cancer model ( ApcMin/+ ) revealed both Mir34a and Mir34b/Mir34c genes were required for tumor suppression since loss of all three Mir34s increased tumor size and aggressiveness . Later studies revealed that multiple types of cancer exhibit hypermethylation and down-regulation of miR-34a or all miR-34 genes , as well as a worse prognosis for tumors with low miR-34 expression levels , suggesting a role of the miR-34 family as tumor suppressors . microRNA ( miRNA ) genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II , processed by Drosha and Dicer enzyme complexes , and then mature 21-25 nucleotide miRNAs associate with the RNA-induced silencing complex to target mRNA by base complementarity . These authors also found in large patient cohorts a significant association of poorer survival of patients with primary colorectal cancer that harbor mutant TP53 and show MIR34A silencing vs those who are TP53 mutant alone . miR-34a performs its functions by inhibiting translation and stability of
[RESULTS] Since only a small number of genes were affected by miR-34a loss at 28 hpf , we performed further RNA-seq experiments comparing wild-type and miR-34a-/- mutants at earlier and later timepoints ( 8 and 72 hpf ) to determine the expression changes from specific miR-34a inactivation and to compare them with the previously reported knock-down data . We then assessed if erythrocyte marker up-regulation leads to a detectable increase of red blood cells and/or their hemoglobin content by staining 3 dpf wild-type and miR-34a-/- mutant embryos for hemoglobin with o-dianisidine ,
[DISCUSSION] The triple knock-out miR-34 study in mice showed no increased tumor incidence in these animals under normal conditions nor upon Myc oncogene expression , but the authors contended that in other tumor types the situation could be different based on higher miR-34 gene levels in the corresponding tissues . Although we were not able to suppress increased myb labeling with artificial miR-34a over-expression likely due to miRNA mimic limitations , we believe that these hematopoiesis-related findings are very significant and future transgenic/knock-in methods will help verify them . A recent study questioned the tumor suppressor function of miR-34a due to evidence that miR-34a is not preferentially repressed or mutated in cancer samples ; its loss does not provide a proliferative advantage and only extreme overexpression can block proliferation . Given the observed up-regulation of erythrocyte markers in miR-34a mutant zebrafish larvae and an actual erythrocyte expansion in concert with the likely underlying increase in myb-positive stem cell numbers , we believe that miR-34a negatively regulates levels of hematopoietic stem cells . This result is consistent with previous miR-34a overexpression studies which reported increased mitotic catastrophe rates and aberrant DNA repair , as well as sensitization of lung cancer cells and tumors toward irradiation via inhibition of RAD51 . miR-34a mimic-injected embryos may experience a higher cumulative amount of cell death over the course of continuous DNA damage due to CPT treatment than after a rapid short burst
[METHODS] CT ( cycles to threshold ) values were extracted from the raw data and analyzed in Microsoft Excel and R. For the p53-induction experiments ( CPT treatment ) , fold changes were calculated using standard ΔΔCT procedures , normalizing target gene data by eef1a1a ( ef1a ) and 18S rRNA gene values as well as by those of control ( DMSO-treated ) samples .

[ABSTRACT] Using a combination of imaging and bioinformatics techniques , we found that hermaphrodite embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division , as well as a more developmentally advanced transcriptional program when xol-1 is lost . Further analyses reveal that XOL-1 is responsible for regulating the timing of initiation of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes , and the appropriate expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites . These findings demonstrate that XOL-1 plays an important role as a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes , and that MET-2 acts as a downstream effector of XOL-1 activity in hermaphrodites . XOL-1 activity is known to be critical for the proper development of C. elegans males , but its low expression was considered to be of minimal importance in the development of hermaphrodite embryos . Expression of xol-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes and autosomes , which differs between XX hermaphrodites and XO males . Our study reveals that XOL-1 plays an important role as a regulator of developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis . We found that xol-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape . Sex determination in the nematode C. elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis . In males , xol-1 is highly expressed and in hermaphrodites , xol-1 is expressed at very low levels . Some of these effects of the loss of xol-1 gene were reversed by the loss of met-2 .
[INTRODUCTION] In this paper we confirm that xol-1 is transcribed in hermaphrodite early embryos at low levels , but contrary to previous assumptions we also show that the loss of xol-1 results in significant changes in the transcriptional profile of these early embryos . These include X-specific deposition of H4K20me1 repressive mark by DPY-21 [ 27-30 ] , tethering of H3K9me2/me3 regions to the nuclear lamina , contributions by the nuclear RNAi machinery , and the formation of TADs on the X chromosomes . The DCC and the additional ancillary pathways it recruits use multiple mechanisms to establish and maintain dosage compensation on the hermaphrodite X chromosomes throughout somatic tissues in larvae and adults [ 24-28 ] . Other organisms such as Drosophila and birds have their own unique mechanisms to establish dosage compensation which involve hyperactivation of one of the sex chromosomes , though in the case of birds the hyperactivation is incomplete . While sex determination and dosage compensation are related pathways and are regulated by a common pathway during in the early stages of embryogenesis in C. elegans , the two pathways eventually diverge and can be regulated independently . In the case of C. elegans , the transcriptional output of both the hermaphrodite X chromosomes is repressed by half to match that of the single male X chromosome through the activity of the dosage compensation complex ( DCC ) . It was shown that in early hermaphrodite embryos , xol-1 is briefly transcribed at low levels but it was assumed to
[RESULTS] To determine if this acceleration of embryonic development was restricted to higher rate of cell divisions without affecting gene expression programs that govern embryonic developmental pathways , or if the acceleration was more global , we analyzed whether the transcriptional state of our time-synchronized xol-1 early embryo population resembled the transcription program from later-stage embryos . Since the xol-1 mutant embryos are time-synchronized with WT but not synchronized in terms of their embryonic development , we also looked at time-resolved embryogenesis datasets to determine whether the change in
[DISCUSSION] The data in this paper also demonstrates that mutations in met-2 are able to reverse some of the phenotypes we have observed in xol-1 mutant embryos , including the precocious loading of the DCC complex onto the X chromosomes ( Fig 3A and 3E ) , and the acceleration of the timeline of embryonic cell divisions ( Fig 2A and 2C ) . This suggests that XOL-1 is a recently evolved gene within the Caenorhabditis genus , where it has assumed the role of the master regulator of sex determination , dosage compensation and as our data shows , a novel regulator that is responsible for controlling the timing of embryonic development . Since there is a distinct lack of any mechanistic insight into how XOL-1 may be regulating any of its downstream targets , including the SDC proteins , it is also difficult to determine whether met-2 is regulated directly or indirectly by XOL-1 . Though the xol-1 gene has very little nucleotide and protein sequence homology with any non-nematode genes , the structure of XOL-1 resolved by x-ray crystallography revealed that it has significant structural homology to GHMP kinase family members . This robustness in embryonic development has been described before in other organisms , where quite significant disruptions in early embryogenesis can be compensated for at later stages resulting in perfectly viable larvae and adults

This procedure generated a number for the intensity corresponding to the Cy3 , FITC and",,961,96,None,"Sex determination in the nematode C . elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis . In males , xol-1 is highly expressed and in hermaphrodites xons are expressed at very low levels . We found that XO mutant embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division , as well as a more developmentally advanced transcriptional program when xOL-1 is lost . Further analyses revealed that xO mutant cells overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3C9me landscape . Some of these effects of the loss of xiol-dependent Xol1 gene were reversed by the deletion of met-2 . Our study reveals that the Xoliolation of X chromosomes is regulated by a master regulator of sex determination , and that MET2 plays an important role in regulating the timing of initiation of dosage compensation ."

[ABSTRACT] A key strength of MGSurvE is that it allows important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for , namely : i ) resources required by mosquitoes ( e. g. , food sources and aquatic breeding sites ) can be explicitly distributed through a landscape , ii ) movement of mosquitoes may depend on their sex , the current state of their gonotrophic cycle ( if female ) and resource attractiveness , and iii ) traps may differ in their attractiveness profile . For these projects , monitoring will be required to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites , and the emergence of alternative alleles , such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes , within intervention sites . Example MGSurvE analyses are presented to demonstrate optimal trap placement for : i ) an Aedes aegypti population in a suburban landscape in Queensland , Australia , and ii ) an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé , São Tomé and Príncipe . To this end , we present MGSurvE ( Mosquito Gene SurveillancE ) : a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized . This entails the need to distribute mosquito traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible-ideally when remediation is still viable . Additionally , insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insecticide-resistance alleles for which there is also a need to detect as quickly as possible . Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing . Especially applicable are mosquito gene drive projects , the potential scale of which leads monitoring to be a significant cost driver . MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance . Further documentation and use examples are provided in project 's documentation .
[INTRODUCTION] Progress has been made in Anopheles malaria vectors towards two general classes of gene drive strategies : i ) `` population replacement '' , whereby inheritance is biased in favor of an allele that confers refractoriness to pathogen transmission ; and ii ) `` population suppression '' , whereby vector populations are suppressed by biasing inheritance in favor of an allele that induces a severe fitness cost or sex bias . For spread beyond field sites , open questions relate to the optimal density and placement of traps and the frequency of sampling required to detect gene drive alleles , drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes while they can still be effectively managed . Surveillance for gene drive projects will be required to monitor the effectiveness of the strategy at field sites , as has been done for previous self-limiting genetic control projects ; however , a more demanding task will be to detect unintended spread of gene drive alleles beyond field sites , and to detect the emergence of alternative alleles both within and beyond field sites . Lessons may be learned from studies of invasive species , a key result for which is that early detection is critical to minimizing invasion impact , preserving the possibility of local elimination , and maximizing the cost-effectiveness of surveillance programs . We describe how to set up , run and interpret output from MGSurvE , and provide examples of trap placement optimization for an Aedes aegypti population in Queensland , Australia , and an Anopheles gambiae population on the tropical island of São Tomé , São Tomé and Príncipe . This is also a concern for population replacement strategies , as when the
[RESULTS] From this output , we see that the GA distributes traps throughout the landscape , often placing them within concentrations of nodes , and sometimes in regions where sub-networks connect to the main section of the landscape , all of which are consistent with faster trapping times . This assumption , however , can be relaxed if we were interested in studying the effects of resource heterogeneity in the way we should approach our surveillance task ( for tutorials on how to incorporate these factors , see the online documentation at https : //chipdelmal .

[ABSTRACT] Using the BpV genome as a reference , we assembled a near-complete 190 kbp draft genome encoding all hallmark prasinovirus genes , as well as two additional incomplete assemblies of closely related but distinct viruses from RCC257 , and three similar draft viral genomes from RCC24 , which we collectively call SsVs . Instead , numerous contigs in assemblies from both RCC24 and RCC257 were closely related to prasinoviruses infecting the green algae Ostreococcus lucimarinus , Bathycoccus prasinos , and Micromonas pusilla ( OlV , BpV , and MpV , respectively ) . We generated both amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data from S. scintillans strains RCC257 and RCC24 , but were unable to detect any sequences from known lineages of endosymbiotic bacteria . The genus was named based on the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum , however , like most such endosymbionts neither the identity nor functional association with its host were known . Interestingly , transmission electron microscopy also revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar the morphology and size of the endosymbiont originally reported in S. scintillans . A multi-gene tree showed the three SsV genome types branched within highly supported clades with each of BpV2 , OlVs , and MpVs , respectively . Overall , we conclude that S. scintillans currently does not harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium , but is associated with giant viruses . The absence of endobacteria was further verified with FISH analyses . Symbiomonas scintillans Guillou et Chrétiennot-Dinet , 1999 is a tiny ( 1 . 4 μm ) heterotrophic microbial eukaryote .
[INTRODUCTION] To identify the endobacterium and its role in such a small protist , we conducted Fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) targeting various groups of bacteria and generated amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data of two strains of S. scintillans . Instead , we observed a viral-like particle by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and recovered three draft viral genomes related to prasinoviruses , namely nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses ( NCLDVs ) belonging to a member of the Phycodnaviridae family . We expect that viral association is especially relevant to nano- or pico-eukaryotes , as there may simply not be enough space for endobacteria , and predict more such findings in the future . Understanding the evolutionary history of eukaryotes is inherently linked to understanding their symbiotic relationships with prokaryotes , whether it is in the form of genetically integrated organelles or the multitude of short-term endosymbioses with bacteria or archaea . Additionally , some bacterial lineages have evolved to be `` professional symbionts '' such as Chlamydiae , Rickettsiales , and Holosporales , consisting entirely of obligate endosymbionts or intracellular parasites of eukaryotic hosts [ 6 , 14-16 ] . Through genome sequencing , prokaryotic symbionts were found to be associated with all major eukaryotic supergroups , involved in a myriad of functions such as metabolism [ 5 , 7-9 ] , defense , parasitism , and motility . 4 μm ) bikosia , Symbiomonas scintillans , where two geographically distinct strains were reported to harbour up to 6 endobacteria , and which served as the inspiration for
[DISCUSSION] Some resistant hosts have been observed to produce infective viruses with nearly undetectable low transcription and without typical lytic events , reminiscent of the fact that no prasinovirus reads and hallmark genes were detected in our RCC257 transcriptome data ( and also to Herpesvirale , another dsDNA virus distantly related to NCLDVs ) . Both these cases illustrate how difficult it can be to identify the nature of an intracellular symbiont , suggesting that more studies on the diversity of symbioses in heterotrophic nano- or pico-flagellates should yield more such surprises and taxonomic re-assignments of many symbionts will also follow . When sequences that had no taxonomic affiliation in WGA data were removed , a scaffold assigned to Marinobacter salinus had the third highest coverage up to x95 , 000 ( N50 = 116K ) , after the ones assigned to Oomycota ( N50 = 276 ) and Cafeteria roenbergensis ( up to x102 , 851 coverage , N60 = 63K ) , a species closely related to S. scintillans ( S2 Dataset ) . To examine the possibility that virophages are involved in the host-virus dynamic , we searched for virophage genes or virophage-like elements ( VLEs ) in the initial assembly without taxonomically filtering scaffolds , due to the nature of some virophage genes being recombinant , horizontally transferred , or homologs that are shared with cellular organisms or transposable elements ( i. e. , polintons

[ABSTRACT] We show here that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay , a cellular mechanism which eliminates mRNAs with premature termination codons , underlies loss of mutant protein from two independent LMOD2 disease-causing mutations . Furthermore , we generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides that obstruct deposition of the exon junction complex , preventing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of mutant LMOD2 transcripts , thereby restoring mutant protein expression . The leiomodin ( Lmod ) family of actin-binding proteins play a critical role in muscle function , highlighted by the fact that mutations in all three family members ( LMOD1-3 ) result in human myopathies . Most of the disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense , or frameshift , mutations predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins . Our investigation lays the initial groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in LMOD-linked myopathies . However , in nearly all cases of disease , little to no LMOD protein is expressed . Mutations in the cardiac predominant isoform , LMOD2 lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy .
[INTRODUCTION] A biallelic mutation in LMOD1 , the smooth muscle-specific LMOD family member , leads to megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome , a visceral myopathy characterized by defective contractile activity of muscles that line the bladder and intestine . In the case of the patient with the first described disease-causing mutation in LMOD2 ( p. W398 * ) , LMOD2 protein was not detected in the explanted heart via western blot analysis and RT-qPCR analysis revealed a decrease in mature LMOD2 mRNA levels , but no change in pre-mRNA levels . Two additional LMOD2 disease-causing mutations ( p. R513 * and p. L415Vfs * 108 ) are predicted to produce truncated proteins , however information is lacking regarding whether , and to what extent , protein is expressed . NMD is a surveillance system whereby the cell detects and degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons ( PTCs ) , however NMD also regulates the levels of certain non-mutated , functional transcripts . The downstream EJCs then recruit proteins ( e. g. , UFP3B and/or UPF2 ) that promote activation of the SURF complex , transforming it into the decay-inducing ( DECID ) complex , leading to degradation of the transcript . The mutations are biallelic in all individuals , with three homozygous for the same mutation ( c. 273+1G > A , p. W398 * , or p. L415Vfs * 108 ) and one consisting of compound heterozygous mutations ( p. R513 * and p. L415Vfs * 108 ) . Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in LMOD3 , the isoform predominant in skeletal muscle , result in nemaline myopathy , a
[RESULTS] To test for this , we treated AD-293 cells expressing LMOD2 MGs with and without the W398 * or R513 * mutations with 100 μg/mL of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide ( CHX ) for 4-5 h. RT-qPCR analysis revealed an increase in mature mRNA levels following treatment with CHX vs vehicle ( VEH ) alone , while pre-mRNA levels remained unchanged ( Fig 2B ) . Protein expression of constructs with and without patient mutations was analyzed in a human cell line ( AD-293 , which are derived from HEK293 cells ) that
[DISCUSSION] Supporting this conclusion , transgenic mice expressing the homologous mutation ( p. W405 * ) to that first discovered to cause disease in humans ( p. W398 * ) live significantly longer than Lmod2 knockout mice , but display dilated cardiomyopathy and die prematurely as adults ( Iwanski et al. , in preparation ) . Furthermore , introduction of mouse GFP-Lmod2 with a mutation ( W405 * ) homologous to the W398 * mutation found in the first patient identified ( generated from cDNA so it is not susceptible to degradation due to NMD ) partially restores cardiac morphology and function in Lmod2 KO mice . Thus , while recovery of mutant protein expression , due to successful inhibition of NMD , is predicted to improve cardiac function and could potentially provide the patient with additional time to receive other therapies or a cardiac transplant , it is not expected to provide a cure since it is likely that fully-functional protein is not made . While the L415Vfs * 108 mutation did not result in a significant decrease in mutant protein when expressed from the minigene construct ( ~90 % of wild type levels ) , when expressed from the CDS construct the mutation results in an increase in protein levels ( ~130 % of wild type ) suggesting that the mutant protein , which contains 108 random residues C-terminal to valine 415 , is more stable than wild type LMOD2 .

[ABSTRACT] In ApoE2 , proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and the membrane , including oxidative phosphorylation complexes , had a similar increase in degradation which suggests coordinated replacement of the entire organelle . In the brain , we found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3 . In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues . Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology . In ApoE4 mice , lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggests that dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy is reducing protein quality . To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk , we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing a human ApoE gene ( isoform 2 , 3 , or 4 ) . Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer 's disease with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3 . We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of ~2700 ontologies . The regulation of each protein 's homeostasis is observed by measuring turnover rate and abundance for that protein .
[INTRODUCTION] Building upon a significant body of literature and this proteome scale study , we propose a unifying mechanism wherein ApoE alleles systemically impact cellular proteostasis through alterations in endosomal trafficking , mitochondrial function , and proteo-lysosomal activity . The ApoE2 protein isoform , characterized by an R158C substitution relative to the ApoE3 , has been associated with decreased affinity for the LDL receptor , while the ApoE4 protein isoform , which features a C112R substitution relative to ApoE3 , favors binding to very-low-density lipoprotein receptors . Although ApoE2 expression protects against AD , its expression is associated with the increased incidence of familial type III hyperlipoproteinemia-a disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize lipids including cholesterol and triglycerides . We apply a simplified kinetic model of proteostasis ( Figs 1B and B in S1 File ) combining turnover rate and concentration data to reveal ApoE isoform-dependent regulation of protein synthesis and degradation . Here we used both quantitative and kinetic proteomics to explore the impact of human ApoE genotypes in the proteome of mice ( Fig A in S1 File ) . Thus , these seemingly minor genotypic changes may lead to modified receptor mediated signaling , lipid availability and metabolic function , or a combination of factors . We investigated the liver and brain , because there is strong evidence that of the ~16 major apolipoproteins , only ApoA1 can cross the blood brain barrier . ApoE isoforms have also been implicated in the development of Parkinson 's disease , vascular pathology , and most recently , COVID-19 prognosis . Both approaches leverage liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry
[RESULTS] For both the E2vsE3 and E4vsE3 comparisons , we identified pronounced increases in Δabundance and reductions in Δturnover ( ↓degradation ) associated with the proteasome complex ( 47 ) Furthermore , an increased Δabundance and Δturnover ( ↑synthesis ) of proteins involved in the Regulation of ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process ( 62 ) was statistically significant in both comparisons ( BH-PV 0 . In contrast , in the ApoE4 mice , major energy production pathways such as Fructose and mannose metabolism ( 21 ) , Pyruvate metabolism ( 32 ) , and Glycogen
[DISCUSSION] Future work investigating ApoE-dependent modification of region-specific lipid transport or protein-protein interactions will be necessary to elucidate the key initiating variables causing these proteostatic changes . Our findings present in vivo evidence that harmonizes with existing literature , linking brain ApoE4-dependent changes in endosomal trafficking , autophagy , proteasome activity , and lower mitochondrial quality . Concurrently , our data suggests that ApoE2 enhances brain mitochondrial health by increasing turnover in tandem with a corresponding increase in proteolysis capacity in the brain ( Fig 6 ) . In this study , we demonstrated how combining protein abundance and turnover rate unveils the cellular regulation of protein synthesis and degradation . Utilizing proteomics data , we compared ontology-level variations due to ApoE genotypes in healthy adult mice .

[ABSTRACT] We validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue , demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system , and showed simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes . To expand tissue-specific CRISPR to this powerful model system , here we present a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRISPR-TRiM ) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons , muscles , and glial cells . Lastly , we found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ . Thus , we have successfully developed an NMJ CRISPR mutagenesis approach which we used to reveal genes important for NMJ structural plasticity . Furthermore , we demonstrate that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling . However , this approach has not been successfully applied to most Drosophila tissues , including the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) . We used CRISPR-TRiM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance . Tissue-specific gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful approach for characterizing gene functions during development .
[INTRODUCTION] Although tissue-specific CRISPR can be very effective for studying gene function , its successful application has been limited to a small number of Drosophila tissues , including the germline , sensory neurons [ 9-12 ] , prothoracic gland , mushroom body neurons , imaginal tissues , epidermal cells , circadian neurons and cardiomyocytes . One example is the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) pathway , which comprises five distinct complexes ( ESCRTs -0 , -I , -II , and -III , and Vps4 ) that sequentially sort monoubiquitinated membrane cargo and mediate membrane fission in late endosomes and at the plasma membrane . Besides the more traditional methods of LOF , such as whole-organismal mutations and RNA interference ( RNAi ) , tissue-specific mutagenesis through the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently emerged as another powerful approach [ 1-5 ] . This toolkit is based on CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRISPR-TRiM ) , a method using tissue-specific expression of Cas9 and ubiquitously expressed gRNAs to knock out genes in the desired tissue . In this approach , either Cas9 or gRNAs ( or both ) are expressed in a tissue-specific manner , so that CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of the gene of interest ( GOI ) occurs only in the desired tissues . In this study , we generated a tissue-specific CRISPR toolkit for knocking out genes in motor neurons , glia , and somatic muscles , the three cell types of the Drosophila NMJ . The Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) is a powerful model for studying many biological processes , such as axon
[RESULTS] At 96 h after egg laying ( AEL ) , 48 % of NMJs innervating muscle 4 in these larvae showed morphological defects characterized by large and round boutons with thin connections ( Fig 3A , 3B and 3G ) , suggesting that simultaneous KO of all three genes occurred in a mosaic pattern . To determine the efficiency of repo-Cas9 , we used previously published gRNAs targeting both comatose ( comt or Nsf1 ) and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor 2 ( Nsf2 ) , which encode two redundant NSF proteins involved in disassembly
[DISCUSSION] To increase the success rate of gRNAs , we recommend the following guidelines : ( 1 ) Select target sequences predicted to have high efficiency scores by multiple experimentally validated algorithms [ 73 , 79-82 ] ; ( 2 ) Choose two gRNAs for each gene of interest , targeting the earlier part of the coding sequence to increase the possibility of early truncations ; ( 3 ) Avoid target sequences that are subject to frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms , which can render gRNAs ineffective ; ( 4 ) Select Cas9 cut sites near sequences that encode conserved amino acid residues to increase the chance of LOF mutations ; ( 5 ) Construct gRNAs in high-efficiency expression vectors such as pAC-U63-gRNA2 . The ESCRT complex is known to play diverse roles in different cellular contexts , including sorting of endosomal proteins [ 50 , 83-87 ] , biogenesis of MVBs [ 88-91 ] , biogenesis of exosome and extracellular vesicles , membrane repair [ 93-96 ] , autophagy [ 97-101 ] and cytokinesis . Alternatively , ESCRT-III is required for more molecular processes than those involving ESCRT-I [ 31 , 113-115 ] , so that the additional defects caused by shrb LOF counteract the effects of receptor accumulation and dampen the overall membrane accumulation at the axon terminal . Second , because mutagenesis occurs individually in each cell and could yield different degrees of LOF , CRISPR-TRiM has the

[ABSTRACT] Using expression analyses , genetic manipulation and pharmacological approaches , we found that the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish ( Rel ) shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that inducts them into the differentiation program by curtailing the activation of JNK . Our study sheds light on how , during development , integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways seem crucial to regulating cell fate transition during development . Studies have shown that ROS triggers the activation of JNK ( c-Jun Kinase ) , which upregulates fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) to facilitate progenitor differentiation . During larval stages , the lymph gland progenitors gradually accumulate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which is essential to prime them for differentiation . Post-larval hematopoiesis in Drosophila largely depends upon the stockpile of progenitors present in the blood-forming organ/lymph gland of the larvae . Although ROS serves as the metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation , the input from ROS is monitored by the developmental signal TAK1 , which is regulated by Relish . Intriguingly , despite having ROS , the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in the late larval stages . This developmental circuit ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely .
[INTRODUCTION] The medially located heterogeneous progenitor cells [ 9-11 ] constitute the medullary zone ( MZ ) at the core and distally located rim of intermediate progenitors ( IZ ) , while the differentiated hemocytes in the periphery of the organ define the cortical zone ( CZ ) of the primary lobe ( Fig 1A ) . Studies have shown that developmentally regulated , moderately high Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS ) levels in the blood progenitor cells of the Drosophila mature lymph gland elicit c-Jun Kinase ( JNK ) to facilitate their differentiation . Here , we show that the metabolic input in the form of ROS is monitored by a developmental signal , which shields the bulk of ROS enriched progenitors from inducting into the differentiation process . Our interrogation identified nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) transcription factor Relish , a component of the immune deficiency ( Imd ) pathway , as a key molecule that prevents the progenitor pool from differentiating precociously . The mature lymph gland has a well-characterized anterior lobe/primary lobe with three distinct zones and a niche ( Posterior Signaling Center ) crucial for maintaining the bulk of the progenitors . Employing expression analyses , genetic and pharmacological approaches , we show that Rel inhibits activation of JNK and thereby shields off the core progenitors from differentiating . ROS evokes JNK , which transcriptionally regulates Carnitine palmitoyl transferase I ( CPTI ) /withered ( whd ) , the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO , to initiate the differentiation of the progenitors . Our study elucidates how the integration
[RESULTS] Since Rel loss of function and gain of function alter JNK activity , we decided to check the status of the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO withered ( whd , Drosophila homolog of CPT1 : Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 ) , in lymph gland progenitors in the above-mentioned genetic backgrounds . Moreover , the enrichment of Rel expression in the progenitors ( Ance+ , Pxn- Fig 1B-1E ' , CHIZ 1S-1T ) and its decline in differentiated blood cells implies that ROS ( Fig 2A-2A '' ' ) during development can not
[DISCUSSION] In this light , our study foregrounds an essential cog in this wheel by showing how a member of the immune pathway can impinge upon metabolism to regulate progenitor cell fate and homeostasis of tissue during development . Along with our genetic evidence that illustrates that a decline in H3K9 acetylation upon Rel overexpression is an outcome of compromised FAO , we can not rule out the possible of involvement of HDACs in this process . However , in our case in sync with previous report , we rule out the involvement of microbe-derived acetate in regulating Rel expression in the lymph gland as no alteration in Rel expression was detected in the lymph glands of axenic larvae . The NF-κB/Relish is a crucial transcription factor in the Drosophila immune deficiency ( Imd ) pathway , activating antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) transcription to combat gram-negative bacterial infections , effectively generating an inflammatory response . Employing genetic , molecular and pharmacological studies demonstrate how a metabolic input is calibrated by a developmental signal downstream to Relish to prevent the differentiation program from becoming prodigal ( Fig 7F ) . Although the presence of relish can be detected in the embryonic lymph gland ( Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project , ) it is intriguing how its expression is restricted to the larval progenitor pool . In this context , it is important to note that microbe-derived acetate has

[ABSTRACT] After deciphering the impact of the variant on the RTTN protein function at centrosome in engineered RTTN-depleted RPE1 cells and patient fibroblasts , we analysed neural stem cells ( NSC ) derived from CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells and revealed major cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities , leading to aneuploidy , cell cycle arrest and cell death . Here , we report a patient presenting with TALS features but no pathogenic variants were found in RNU4ATAC , instead the homozygous RTTN c. 2953A > G variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing . Altogether , these defects contributed to a marked delay of rosette formation in RTTN-mutated organoids , thus impeding their overall growth and shedding light on mechanisms leading to microcephaly . In cortical organoids , we discovered an additional function of RTTN in the self-organisation of NSC into neural rosettes , by observing delayed apico-basal polarization of NSC . Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly with abnormal gyral pattern , severe growth retardation and bone abnormalities . Its transcript , the small nuclear RNA U4atac , is involved in the excision of ~850 minor introns . It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNU4ATAC gene .
[INTRODUCTION] The Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ) , or MOPD1 , is a very rare genetic disease with less than 100 reported cases [ 1-6 ] characterized by severe pre- and post-natal growth delay , severe microcephaly with brain abnormalities ( abnormal gyral pattern , intracranial cyst , cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and corpus callosum agenesis ) , intellectual deficiency , bone abnormalities , bulging eyes and dry skin with eczema , as well as a premature death during the first months of life for the most severe cases [ 7-9 ] . This ribonucleic complex excises less than one percent of all human introns , and deficiency in its function leads in most cases to minor intron retention that impairs the correct maturation of about 750 minor-intron containing transcripts [ 2 , 13-17 ] . RTTN encodes the large centrosomal protein Rotatin ( 2 , 226 amino-acids ) , and was initially discovered by a forward genetic screen in the mouse model , with the particular phenotype of Rttn mutant embryos failing to undergo the axial rotation during embryogenesis . Most of these patients exhibit common features , at variable degrees of severity , including microcephaly with gyral pattern abnormalities , sloping forehead , intellectual deficiency , and pre- and post-natal growth delay . We carried out a thorough analysis of the impact of the RTTN isoforms resulting from the mutated allele identified in the patient and conducted cellular studies of the centrosome/primary cilium complex and their related functions . Overall , our results establish how RTTN c. 2953A > G variant affects
[RESULTS] In the latter , two siblings , negative for RNU4ATAC but having compound heterozygous missense variants in RTTN , were clinically diagnosed with MOPD1 as they were presenting severe pre- and post-natal growth delay , severe microcephaly ( with cerebellar hypoplasia , dysgenesis/agenesis of corpus callosum , lissencephaly or reduced sulcation , ventricular abnormalities ) , joint contractures and the typical facial dysmorphism ( prominent eyes , sloping forehead , micrognathia ) . No strong alteration of centriole length was detected in KI NSC ( S7G and S7H Fig ) ,
[DISCUSSION] Indeed , several studies reported that alterations of cilium disassembly lead to a reduction of the proliferation rate of NSC [ 38-42 ] , while another pointed out the role of cilium-related Shh pathway in NSC division into other progenitor cell types ( basal radial glial cells , intermediate progenitors ) necessary for brain size increase and folding . We showed that this variant mostly exerts its pathogenicity by inducing the skipping of in-frame exon 23 that encodes 23 amino-acids , and that it has a pleiotropic impact on diverse cellular processes occurring concomitantly or in cascade , including alterations of cell organization/polarity , division and survival of neural progenitors . These alterations of NSC were also seen in cortical organoids ( delayed proliferation/cell division , increased apoptosis ) ( Fig 7 ) , and are thus likely to contribute to the reduction of the NSC pool , which is responsible for the overall reduced number and size of neural rosettes ( Fig 6A-6C ) and hence , of organoids ( Fig 5 ) , mimicking the microcephaly seen in the patient . Not only does it reinforce the possible feature overlap between RNU4ATAC and RTTN mutated patients , but it also stresses the involvement of primary cilium defects in the pathophysiology of primary microcephaly syndromes-even though this clinical feature is not among those of the well-known ciliopathies . In addition to bringing information about the

[ABSTRACT] The high parallelism with which adaptations occur under LTSP , combined with the LTSP populations ' lineage structure , enable us to screen for pairs of loci displaying a significant association in the occurrence of mutations , suggestive of a historical contingency . Like many other non-sporulating bacterial species , Escherichia coli is able to survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion , by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase ( LTSP ) . Utilizing whole genome sequencing data obtained for hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points spanning the first six years of these experiments , we reveal several novel aspects of the dynamics of adaptation . In these experiments populations of E. coli were allowed to initially grow on fresh rich media , but were not provided with any new external growth resources since their establishment . First , we show that E. coli continuously adapts genetically , up to six years under resource exhaustion , through the highly convergent accumulation of mutations . We find that such associations are highly frequent and that a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one such association . In July 2015 , we initiated a set of evolutionary experiments aimed at characterizing the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LTSP . Combined our results demonstrate that LTSP adaptation is characterized by remarkably high parallelism and frequent historical contingency . This lineage structure is in itself convergent , with similar lineages arising across independently evolving populations . We further show that upon entry into LTSP , long-lasting lineages are established .
[INTRODUCTION] Making these arguments more confusing , the word 'contingency ' itself is often used to imply different meanings : on the one hand a possible , but quite unlikely and thus unpredictable , future event ( e. g. planning for every contingency ) , and on the other hand an event whose occurrence depends on a different event and is quite likely given that event . Researchers have argued about whether evolution is largely deterministic , most frequently following the same paths , or whether evolution tends to be far less predictable , due in part to frequent contingencies , making it impossible to `` replay life 's tape '' . Data from the sequencing of ~10 clones per population , from each of nine sampled time points , spanning the first three years of the experiment ( for a total of 413 sequenced clones ) , have enabled us to begin characterizing the dynamics of adaptation under LTSP . Specifically , the ability of E. coli to adapt to utilize citrate as a carbon source required a large number of mutations to occur in a fairly specific order , with the effect of certain mutations depending on the previous occurrence of others [ 8 , 11-14 ] . Such convergence , or parallelism ( the terms will be used interchangeably in this paper ) , means that similar adaptive patterns and events tend to happen in parallel , across independently evolving populations , implying increased predictability . Results of
[RESULTS] An additional example of a locus that is mutated exclusively within lineages defined by a specific RNAPC mutation is the emergence of mutations in both the dctA dicarboxylate transport gene and its promoter on the background of three out of five lineages defined by the RpoC K334Q mutation , and never on the background of any other lineage-defining mutations ( S11 Table ) . In addition to putative contingencies involving genes and their TFs , we also observed four instances in which mutations to a certain gene
[DISCUSSION] Also , irrespective of the metric used , a similarly high percentage of convergently mutated loci ( more than one third ) were found to be involved in at least one putative contingency relationship , thus demonstrating that our major finding , that contingencies are highly frequent is fairly stable and reliable . For example if adaptations A , B , and C always occur first and only then do adaptations D , E and F occur , it would not explain why we would only see adaptation D on the background of A , and never on the background of B or C. That being said , further mechanistic studies will be needed in order to verify and determine the roles of the putative contingencies we identified . At the same time , we believe that the strong statistical associations we observe between the occurrence of mutations in lineages can not be entirely explained by such temporal ordering , without contingency , as such temporal ordering would not be expected to lead to certain adaptations only occurring on the background of other specific adaptations . Since the other experiments either did not span a long enough period of time , did not examine multiple populations ( over long periods of time ) , or did not carry out whole genome sequencing of individual clones
[METHODS] In order to estimate the strength of apparent association between the RpoB E1272G lineage defining mutation and the mutator trait , which , in our experiment was driven by mutations to three different mismatch repair genes ( mutS , mutL and mutH ) , we generated a contingency table in which mutations in all three DNA-mismatch genes were counted as one entity",,985,98,None,"Despite the fact that evolution is largely deterministic , it tends to be far less predictable , due in part to frequent contingencies , making it impossible to “replay life’s tape” .

[ABSTRACT] Although originally classified as a non-coding RNA , the male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) RNA from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex has recently been shown to code for a micropeptide that plays a vital role in determining how mated females use stored sperm after mating . Through cell culture and transgenic analysis , we show that this mechanism relies on the presence of upstream open reading frames present in these two exons that prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames . Interestingly , the MSA transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript produced in both sexes within the posterior central nervous system from an alternative promoter , called the iab-8 lncRNA . Here , we show that the absence of iab-8 translation is due to a repressive mechanism requiring the two unique 5 ' exons of the iab-8 lncRNA . However , while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide , it seems that the iab-8 transcript does not .
[INTRODUCTION] Using GFP reporter constructs in tissue culture cells and transgenic constructs in living flies , we show that the presence of upstream ATG sequences ( or upstream open reading frames-uORFs ) in the 5 ' exons of iab-8 prevent downstream translation from the iab-8 transcript . Given the conservation of these uORFs in Drosophila , it is interesting to note that we can find no overt phenotypic effect on the development or behavior of the fly , when we ectopically express the MSA version of the transcript . Later , it was found that this transcript is specifically expressed in a particular cell type of the seminal fluid producing , male accessory gland ( AG ) , called the secondary cells ( SCs ) . Within the cis-regulatory region controlling the expression of the two , most-posterior homeotic genes of Drosophila melanogaster ( abd-A and Abd-B ) , two transcripts have been identified that differ only at their 5 ' ends [ 1-3 ] . Interestingly , although the iab-8 transcript shares the sORF coding for MSAmiP , using GFP fusions we were never able to detect this peptide in the CNS , where iab-8 is expressed . We have previously shown that the loss of this miRNA in the AG leads to both the abnormal development of the secondary cells and an abnormal post-mating response in females after mating . Although both of these RNAs were originally classified as non-coding and have essential non-coding functionalities , we recently discovered that the MSA version of the transcript is actually protein coding . We explore the possibility that this repressive mechanism may
[RESULTS] As seen in Fig 3 , repressive activity could be found in Fragments B and D. Given our results during the examination of the 200 bp fragment ( fragment F ) , we tested the B and D regions for potential translational initiation by fusing an ATG-less GFP coding sequence downstream of the fragments in each of the three reading frames . We tested the translation potential of these two transcripts by placing the coding sequence of GFP as an in-frame fusion to the MSAmiP sequence in the context of the full length MSA
[DISCUSSION] Under stress conditions , these factors are less available and causing the 40S subunit to bypass the additional inhibitory uORFs to eventually find the GCN4 coding sequence , by which time it has formed the ternary complex to initiate translation . However , this is not unexpected and likely reflects the poor resolution of our lens when examining phenotype ; subtle behavioral phenotypes or slight changes in neural connectivity , for example , would go largely unnoticed by our analysis . The recent popularity of techniques like ribosome profiling has highlighted an additional level of complexity to this aspect of gene regulation by finding that translation initiation can also be impacted through competition among the sites of translation initiation . This is consistent with both our previously described finding of transcriptional interference on the abd-A promoter by the iab-8 transcript , and the concept of posterior dominance within the hox complexes ( where posterior/upstream genes function over anterior/downstream genes ) . While we believe that the uORFs in the iab-8 transcript might be used to prevent the creation of spurious ABD-A protein , this does preclude the coded peptides from having a biological function in their own right . Although we have not tested if ribosomes stall on the iab-8 transcript , we decided to examine the codon usage of the uORFs with the idea that a preponderance of rare codons might also slow ribosome progression . While the interactions between overlapping ORFs are
[METHODS] For those species the nucleotide sequences covering both parts were extracted and , when necessary , one or two bases were added after the first STOP codon to reveal both ORFs in one single string of amino-acid that could be aligned . The coverslips were then mounted on slides with Vectashield including DAPI ( Vector labs , California , USA ) and imaged on a Leica SP8",,933,95,None,"The male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) RNA from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex has recently been shown to code for a micropeptide that plays a vital role in determining how mated females use stored sperm after mating .

[ABSTRACT] ERC analysis of disease genes and biological pathways allows for rapid prioritization of potential genetic modifiers , which can provide a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets . CDG typically present with seizures , hypotonia , and developmental delay but display large clinical variability with symptoms affecting every system in the body . We also identified strong patterns of ERC based on cellular sub-localization of the GPI anchor synthesis enzymes . Using ERC , we identified strong evolutionary rate signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways . Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with ncRNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins . Because of the similar physiology and clinical symptoms , there are likely common genetic modifiers between CDG . Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes . Evolutionary rate covariation ( ERC ) identifies proteins with similar evolutionary rates that indicate shared biological functions and pathways . Here , we use evolution as a tool to identify common modifiers between CDG and glycosylation genes . Mutations in glycosylation pathways , such as N-linked glycosylation , O-linked glycosylation , and GPI anchor synthesis , lead to Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ( CDG ) . Protein glycosylation is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals . This variability suggests modifier genes might influence the phenotypes .
[INTRODUCTION] When examining the genome for non-glycosylation modifiers of GPI anchor synthesis proteins , we found high ERC scores with proteins involved in multiple unrelated pathways , including ncRNA and DNA repair . Protein pairs with high ERC values have similar changes in evolutionary rate and are thought to function together , either in a complex or in a pathway , and may genetically modify each other . In 2002 , a study examined a small group of PMM2-CDG patients , the most common CDG , and identified a variant in ALG6 , an N-linked glycosylation gene , segregating with more severe outcomes . A CRISPR screen in cells with reduced DPAGT1 function , the first step in N-glycan synthesis , identified multiple glycosylation genes able to rescue glycosylation defects caused by inhibition of DPAGT1 . We found strong intra-pathway ERC signatures among glycosylation proteins in each of the three glycosylation pathways , with the highest average score in GPI anchor synthesis . Identifying genetic modifiers of CDG will lead to a better understanding of the physiology underlying variable symptoms in patients and could point to new therapeutic targets . In yet another study , a yeast model of PMM2-CDG was evolved over 1000 generations to identify genetic changes that increased the viability of the PMM2 mutant yeast strains . A modifier screen and ERC analysis of NGLY1 , a deglycosylating enzyme associated with a CDG , identified multiple glycosylation genes showing high ERC with NGLY1 , implicating them as potential modifiers . In the ER lumen
[RESULTS] To identify potential proteins that could modify multiple CDG genes across the pathway , we also ran GO analysis on proteins that had a significant ERC score with at least a third ( 10 or more ) of the 30 GPI anchor synthesis proteins ( Fig 6 and S2 Data ) . To determine if this enrichment was significant , we compared the actual number of ERC values each GPI anchor synthesis protein had in the top 1 % to an expected number of values , assuming an
[DISCUSSION] It is feasible that cytoplasmic components interact with a wider variety of proteins , which also influence their evolutionary rates in different ways , making it more difficult for them to have strong ERC scores . Since glycosylation is a co-translational/post-translational modification , it suggests the evolutionary relationship identified between glycosylation proteins and rRNA processing proteins could be due to glycosylation 's dependence on the ribosome functioning properly and translating proteins . High ERC between N-linked glycosylation and GPI anchor synthesis could also suggest unexplored connections between these pathways , and they may need to be studied together instead of in isolation . In vivo testing of top hits from our analysis had a hit rate ( 10 out of 16 ) higher than previously found in other ERC studies ( 5/16 and 12/34 , respectively ) . N-glycans and GPI anchors have multiple mannoses added to their glycan chains , and they both rely on the DPM complex to supply mannose into the lumen of the ER . Previous attempts to identify genetic modifiers with standard methods ( i. e. , mutagenesis screens and using natural variation in the population ) have found promising candidates [ 14-16 , 20 ] . Only one type of O-linked glycan incorporates mannose , which could explain why O-linked glycosylation does not have as high of ERC scores with the other glycosylation pathways
[METHODS] We observe a larger excess of lower empirical p-values calculated based on mean Integrated ERCs in comparison to mean Mammal ERCs ( S11 Fig ) , as well as significantly more CORUM complexes identified at an FDR of 5 % ( Integrated ERC : 326 complexes , Mammal ERC : 172 complexes ) .

[ABSTRACT] These findings not only decipher the mechanism by which Pol-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc regulates pgRNA encapsulation , but also reveal the possibility of PP1 as a potential target for antiviral development . Therefore , HBV Pol may play a dual role by initially bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HBc and recruiting PP1 for later completion of RNA packaging into the capsids . Pol-pgRNA-PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and appears to be associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) . The Pol-dependent dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 was confirmed by the substitution of one single amino acid at Val782 in the RNase H domain , which abolished the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 . As capsids mature , the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation , suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation , which remains to be determined . Phosphorylation of the HBc CTD , especially at Ser162 and Ser170 , is essential for nucleation with the polymerase ( Pol ) to initiate pgRNA encapsidation . This recruitment does not require HBc but does require Pol via epsilon RNA signal , suggesting that the Pol-pgRNA complex plays a key role in PP1 recruitment . Immunoprecipitation , mass spectrometry analyses , and the protein structural analyses showed that the recruitment of the host phosphatase PP1 is dependent on the Pol-Val782 domain . The HBV core ( HBc ) protein contains an N-terminal domain ( NTD ) for capsid assembly and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain ( CTD ) for pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) encapsidation . Using a C-S170 antibody specific for non-phosphorylated HBc-Ser170 , we observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state during pgRNA packaging .
[INTRODUCTION] To address these questions , we generated an antibody ( Ab ) capable of distinguishing the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of HBc at Ser170 , which allowed us to monitor the phosphorylation pattern of HBc-Ser170 during the progressive stages of pgRNA packaging . Although two phosphatases , PP2A and PP1 , have been reported involved in the dephosphorylation of HBc , it remains unclear which phosphatase is responsible for this dephosphorylation process , how it is recruited into the Pol-pgRNA complex , and how it affects pgRNA encapsidation . The nucleic acid-binding activity of the HBc CTD is primarily attributed to positive charge from a series of four arginine-rich domains ( ARDs ) [ 13-16 ] . This cccDNA serves as the template for the production of pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) and four viral mRNA transcripts , which are then translated into viral proteins . A decrease in the positive charge by Arg-to-Ala substitution in the CTD may reduce RNA packaging activity , which can however be rescued by decreasing negative charge by Ser-to-Ala substitution . It is possible that the phosphorylation of the HBc CTD is involved in the initial stage of pgRNA encapsidation , but the subsequent dephosphorylation of HBc is required for the enclosing of pgRNA into the mature capsid in the late stage of encapsidation . Following the infection of hepatocytes through the NTCP receptor and uncoating , the viral relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) is imported and converted to closed
[RESULTS] We next tried to address whether Pol-dependent HBc-Ser170 dephosphorylation was dependent on other viral factors , such as HBc or pgRNA , by the same sucrose gradient-based compartmentation analysis , First , we expressed Flag-Pol or Flag-Pol-V782Y in Huh7 cells , but did not find changes in the distribution of endogenous PP1 to the Pol-containing fractions ( S6A Fig , fractions 9-10 ) . To further identify key viral factors , we expressed Pol as well as HBV replicons either without HBc ( Ec- Pol-
[DISCUSSION] Although our study has clarified the role of Pol-dependent HBc dephosphorylation in the formation of mature HBV nucleocapsids , it is worth noting that previous studies using HBc non-phosphorylatable ( Ser to Ala ) mutants have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser residues at 162 and 170 of HBc is required for the packaging of pgRNA . At the same time , phosphorylated HBc-Ser170 ( and/or HBc-Ser162 ) also plays a key role in the recruitment of Pol-pgRNA complex , which acts to nucleate capsid assembly and is critical for accumulating the first few subunits of the growing capsid as well as the formation of an incomplete RNA-filled capsids . The use of the Pol-V782Y mutant ( in either the WT or YMHD mutant replicon ) , which retains two major functions of Pol for encapsidation ( formation of Pol-pgRNA complexes and interaction with HBc ) but impairs PP1 recruitment , confirmed the crucial role of Pol in mediating the dephosphorylation process to complete RNA encapsidation . Since our C-S170 Ab is specific only for the non-phosphorylated Ser170-containing epitope , further studies may be needed to investigate the effect of Pol-recruited PP1 on other putative phosphorylation sites in HBc CTD . Our study , using Pol-V782Y in HBV , identified for the first time its critical role in recruiting PP1 phosphatase to dephosphorylate

Here , we demonstrate that the phosphate phosphatacetic acid-binding activity of the HBC CTD is dependent on the pol-Val782 domain . We also show that the recruitment of the host phosphostase PP1 is dependent upon a single amino acid at Val782 in the RNase H domain , which abolished the dephosphorolation of HBb-Ser170 . These findings not only decipher the mechanism by which Pol–pgRA-PP1-mediated dephospholysis of BBc regulates mRNA packaging , but also reveal the possibility of PP-1 as a potential target for antiviral development ."

[INTRODUCTION] Bacterial symbionts of animals can potentially adapt to changing environments more rapidly and more flexibly than their hosts due to traits such as shorter generation times , enhanced recombination capabilities , and the potential for horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) between distantly-related organisms . The adaptation strategies enabling these sister species to thrive in their respective , contrasting environments have been extensively studied , but these studies have primarily focused on the animals themselves , largely overlooking the potential influence of host-associated microorganisms ( reviewed in ) . Animal populations that were once connected became separated by the closure of the Isthmus , ultimately resulting in the emergence of sister species on separate evolutionary trajectories , diverging in response to the markedly different environmental conditions on either side of the Isthmus . In addition , horizontally acquired bacterial symbionts-those obtained from the environment in each generation-have access to a larger genetic pool for genetic exchange during their free-living phase , which can lead to faster adaptive responses . Recent studies have begun to unveil the metabolic and genomic diversity among symbionts from vastly different environments across the globe , including differences in their abilities to metabolize carbon and inorganic nitrogen [ 18-20 ] . Using phylogenetic reconciliation , we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon and identified two distinct HGT events that led to nif gene acquisition and correlated with the colonization of nutrient-poor environments . Global change gives rise

This notable difference could be explained by a lack of resolution in the data , as Osvatic and colleagues analyzed Ca . T. gloverae , a globally-distributed symbiont inhabiting deep-water or temperate environments , as well as the rates previously reported for Ca . T. endolucinda was therefore the lowest of the three globally distributed lucinid symbiont
[DISCUSSION] Sedimenticola endophacoides clade associated with P. pectinatus from a region in Florida that experiences seasonal upwelling events [ 52-54 ] presents the opportunity to study how a change in access to abundant nutrient resources could drive gene loss and eventually lead to diversification of this clade . Hence , the absence of nitrogen fixation genes in the symbiont MAGs from the nitrogen-rich TEP region is consistent with the hypothesis that lucinid symbiont diazotrophy has evolved as an adaptation to life in nitrogen-poor oligotrophic habitats like tropical coral reefs and seagrass beds . Given that both MAGs were obtained from samples of the same host species and location ( Queensland , Australia ) ( Fig 3B ) , and no additional metadata is available , further investigation is required to understand evolution of nitrogen fixation in the Monitilora ramsayi symbiosis . It is intriguing to speculate that the gammapolyglutamate synthesis and ETF dehydrogenase genes are beneficial to the TEP symbionts during the seasonal environmental changes typical of upwelling regions , which include changes in nutrient levels , colder temperatures , or reduced oxygen levels [ 38-41 ] . quadrata lineages , which either originate from nutrient-rich upwelling regions or deep waters ( S2 Table ) , are incapable of fixing nitrogen , possibly due to the absence of selection

[ABSTRACT] Mammalian TAS2Rs have historically garnered the most attention , leading to our understanding of their roles in taste perception relevant to human physiology and behaviors . Large-scale phylogenomic analyses reveal that frogs and salamanders contain unusually high TAS2R gene content , in stark contrast to other vertebrate lineages . We find that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species , although total TAS2R count is stable in most lineages . In vitro receptor activity assays uncover that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics . In most species , TAS2R genes are found in clusters ; compared to other vertebrates , amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster . However , the evolution and functional implications of TAS2Rs in other vertebrate lineages remain less explored . Interestingly , TAS2R count is proportional to the receptors expressed solely in extra-oral tissues . TAS2Rs are a family of G protein-coupled receptors that function as bitter taste receptors in vertebrates . Here , we identify 9 , 291 TAS2Rs from 661 vertebrate genomes .
[INTRODUCTION] Despite evidence that amphibians have an incredible diversity of TAS2Rs , with current literature values ranging from 3 or 4 in Gaboon caecilians ( Geotrypetes seraphini ) to almost 250 in Japanese wrinkled frogs ( Glandirana rugosa ) , the full scope and underlying mechanisms of the massive expansion of TAS2R genes in amphibians , and the sensory and ecological functions of these receptors remain largely unknown . However , most non-anuran amphibians ( salamanders and caecilians ) are generalist predators throughout their life , and amphibians interact with bitter compounds in a variety of ecological contexts beyond aversive taste , suggesting that trophic differences across life stages are not the only factor influencing the evolution and diversification of the TAS2R family . Whereas sweet , umami , and mildly salty are generally considered to be attractive stimuli , guiding animals towards nutrient-rich foods , bitter and sour are considered aversive , and are believed to guide animals away from noxious substances , such as toxins or metabolites found in spoiled food . found distinct TAS2R expression profiles in the mouth tissue of tadpole and adult American bullfrogs ( Rana catesbeiana , also known as Lithobates catesbeianus or Aquarana catesbeiana ) , and showed that many of these receptors are capable of responding to classic human bitterants . In this study , we performed genome-wide comparative analyses of 9 , 291 TAS2Rs from 661 high-quality vertebrate genomes in order to gain insights into the unique evolutionary trajectories and dynamics of the TAS2R gene family in amphibians . Over the last two decades , ligands have been identified
[RESULTS] The two best models , which accounted for 81 % of the pBIC weight identified six highly-supported regime shifts across the vertebrate phylogeny ( marked as red dots on Fig 1A ) : Three increases in the `` optimal '' gene family size were inferred at the base of bony fishes , the branch ancestral to lobe-finned fishes , and the branch ancestral to batrachians , and three decreases were inferred in cetaceans , snakes , and the warbler Setophaga coronata , most of which exhibited zero or one receptor ( Figs 1A
[DISCUSSION] Overall , our detailed gene cluster analysis across vertebrates suggests that the frequent formation and expansion of TAS2R clusters due to their local genomic environments may be a major driver of the large and lineage-specific TAS2Rs repertoires in amphibians . Our unified gene mining workflow across over 600 vertebrates indicates that in frogs and salamanders ( batrachians ) the TAS2Rs gene family experienced a rapid expansion , leading to a wider repertoire of these genes than any other lineage of vertebrates examined to date . The high levels of gene turnover in some TAS2R lineages suggest that there may be some degree of interchangeability between genes , perhaps because they fulfill similar functions , and are therefore able to compensate for the loss of other genes . We also find that these cluster loci can be very old ( up to 350 million years ) , even though the genes within them appear comparatively young , either due to rapid gene turnover or gene conversion . The mutational input ( i. e. , gene duplication , loss , and conversion ) promoted by recombination may have provided the raw material for novel expression patterns to arise , and perhaps allowed for rapid expansion and diversification of TAS2Rs within the batrachian lineage . For instance , bullfrogs have intestinal/liver receptors for marinobufagenin , which is produced by cane toads and their relatives , and is similar to other cardiotonic steroids ( i.
[METHODS] In order to determine whether this was true , we took the distribution of cluster sizes for each lineage ( amphibian , mammal , etc ) and the proportion of genes that are CNCO in each lineage , and used a binomial distribution to calculate the expected number of clusters containing exactly one vs more than one CNCOs . Each trio was chosen either to highlight",,910,94,None,"The TAS2R family is a family of G protein-coupled receptors that function as bitter taste receptors in vertebrate lineages .

[ABSTRACT] To ask if HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes , we used the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could prevent the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitors ( DBZ or DAPT ) treatment in mice and spheroids , suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells . Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids uncovered no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene miss-regulation , confirmed impaired stem cell maintenance in-vitro , and discovered an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts , a likely underlying cause for heightened sensitivity in NDD mice . TurboID followed by quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line expressing either NOTCH2DD or NOTCH2 revealed an unbalanced interactome , with reduced interaction of NOTCH2DD with the transcription machinery but relatively preserved interaction with the HDAC2 interactome suggesting modulation via cooperativity . Mice expressing Notch dimerization-deficient alleles ( NDD ) of Notch1 and Notch2 are sensitized to environmental insults but otherwise develop and age normally . A tri-protein complex containing NICD , RBPj and MAML1 binds DNA as monomer or as cooperative dimers to regulate transcription .
[INTRODUCTION] To test the assumption that HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes we used the broad acting HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could block the intestinal consequences of NDD as well as gamma secretase inhibitor treatment ( DBZ or DAPT ) in mice and spheroids , respectively , suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells . We hypothesized that dimer-deficiency and loss of cooperativity altered the balance between transcription machinery interactions vs. the dimer independent negative regulatory/deacetylase complex , somehow sensitizing the animal to environment-mediated insults , and perhaps regulating the level of protein acetylation among interacting partners in a dimer independent fashion which might explain the relatively mild phenotype in the absence of microbiome . In the absence of NICD , CSL associates with co-repressors SPEN ( Split Ends homologue , also called MINT ( MSX2 interacting nuclear target ) or SHARP ( SMRT/HDAC1 associated Repressor Protein ) ) , NCOR1 ( nuclear receptor corepressor1 ) , NCOR2 ( also called SMART ) and others , maintaining transcription in the off-state . The NICD translocates to the nucleus , where it forms the Notch transcription complex ( NTC ) together with the co-factors RBPj/CSL ( Recombinant binding protein for immunoglobulin J Kappa ; CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG-1 ) and MAML ( Mastermind-like ) family members . Intestinal stem cells ( ISC ) reside at the bottom of the crypts , marked by the expression of leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 ( Lgr5 ) , achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 (
[RESULTS] Importantly , the DEG analysis was inconsistent with the hypothesis that dimerization was only required for targets regulated by SPS sites , present in over 20 % of enhancers based on studies in a T-ALL cell line : expression of dimer-dependent targets such as NRARP , Hes5 , or Hes1 was unchanged , suggesting that differentially expressed genes reflected an overall reduction in Notch transcriptional activity rather than selective reduction of dimer-dependent gene expression ( Fig 5 and S1A Table ) . Surprisingly , VPA , which on its own had
[DISCUSSION] Because biotinylation of the HDAC2-anchored complex is affected to a lesser degree in Notch2RA-TurboID relative to the reduction in the positive regulator network interactions , we hypothesized that perhaps the HDAC2 biotinylation may occur when a monomer NTC is sharing SPS with a co repressor complex , or that HDAC2 might play a role outside of transcription , and possibly outside the canonical function of NICD . Moreover , spheroids form NDD mice show enrichment for genes associated with host defense against symbionts and interferon-ß targets , consistent with an elevated colonic epithelium innate immunity response in the absence of immune cells or symbionts ; none of these transcripts is known to be a direct Notch target . Conditional deletion of HDAC2 alone was shown to protect against DSS , however , and in contrast to the benefits of HDAC inhibition , deletion of both HDAC1 and 2 in mice seems to enhance sensitivity to induced colitis and disrupts epithelial barrier function [ 62-64 ] , indicating that at least some activity is necessary to rip the protective benefits . Since the transcriptomic analysis did not explain why loss of dimerization affected performance in some areas but not others , we investigated the hypothesis the Notch dimers had different proteomic envelop than NICD or monomers , and that the differences might be contributing to the phenotype . However , the most important RBPj co-repressor partner , MINT/SHARP/SPEN [

[ABSTRACT] The theory of background selection may be split into two regimes : the background selection regime , where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are sufficiently low such that deleterious alleles are at a deterministic mutation-selection balance , and the interference selection regime , where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are sufficiently high that deleterious alleles accumulate and interfere with another , leading to selective interference . Here , we derive novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extend previous theory from the interference selection regime to make predictions in an island model . Moreover , we demonstrate that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates , because migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations . Furthermore , there is evidence to suggest that migration reduces the effects of background selection on FST , but this has not been fully explained . Background selection , by which selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites , influences patterns of total neutral diversity , πT , and genetic differentiation , FST , in structured populations . However , we show that background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT , particularly for metapopulations with a larger effective population size . Our work further extends the theory of background selection into structured populations , and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans . Previous work has quantified the effects of background selection on πT and FST only for deleterious alleles in the background selection regime . Using simulations , we show that this theory best predicts FST and πT .
[INTRODUCTION] In a panmictic population , Santiago & Caballero [ 25-26 ] suggest that , in order to understand the effects of background selection on Nf at a neutral allele , we must consider both the magnitude of additive genetic fitness variance created by associated deleterious alleles , VA , as well as the cumulative effects of this variance on the reproductive success of a neutral allele over time , estimated by the linkage inflation factor Q2 . We may do so by considering that it is not the asymptotic linkage inflation factor , Q∞2 , that is most relevant to prediction of metrics of genetic diversity [ 11 supp. , 26 ] Instead , at equilibrium , there is variation in the time in which neutral alleles have arisen in the past and therefore the degree to which they have experienced the effect of background selection . Here , we account for the fact that the association between a neutral and deleterious allele also ends within a focal subpopulation if the individual carrying the haplotype emigrates out of the subpopulation , which will occur with rate m. Thus , the autocorrelation function for a neutral allele associated with deleterious allele i over time is C ( τ ) = [ ( 1−ri ) ( 1−ti ) ( 1−m ) ] τ , where τ is the number of generations . Under the strong selection regime , it was assumed that the rate of decay in association between
[RESULTS] Thus , our results suggest that the alignment of observed FST value to neutral prediction at low FST values may not be sufficient to predict the absence of background selection in empirical systems , as it may otherwise be explained by the presence of both background selection and high migration rates . Moderately deleterious alleles , however , generate moderate variance in fitness and are not rapidly purged from the population ; thus , we expected an intermediate maximum of FST with respect to strength
[DISCUSSION] In summary , we have provided a novel theoretical derivation of the effects of background selection in an island model ; this model accounts for the effects of migration providing an opportunity to lessen the effects of background selection by truncating cross-generational associations between neutral and deleterious alleles in their reproductive success , and presents a first step into the application of background selection theory in systems with more complex demography . Here , we have extended quantitative genetic models of background selection [ 11 , 25-26 ] to account for the effects of migration in an island model , showing that migration , in addition to selection and recombination , acts to end the cross-generational association between a neutral allele and linked deleterious alleles . Our work suggests that the relative importance of the 'migration effect ' in influencing Blocal depends on the magnitude of the heterozygous selection coefficient , t , and the migration rate , m. In cases where t > > m , we expect the effect of migration to be relatively weak , as selection will likely act to remove deleterious variants prior to their emigration from a population . In cases where migration rates are comparable to or stronger than the strength of selection against deleterious alleles , that is , m ≥ t , we

[ABSTRACT] Motivated by these , we developed FedGMMAT , a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites . As the sample sizes become more heterogeneous , complex statistical approaches , such as generalized linear mixed effects models , must be used to correct for the confounders that may bias results . On another front , due to the privacy concerns around Protected Health Information ( PHI ) , genetic information is restrictively protected by sharing according to regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) . Using simulated and real datasets , we demonstrate FedGMMAT can achieve the virtually same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements . Federated approaches are promising to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance , since sensitive data never leaves the local sites . Evidently , establishing practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies . Genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites , and the intermediate statistics are protected by encryption . This limits data sharing among institutions and hampers efforts around executing high-powered collaborative studies . Increasing genetic and phenotypic data size is critical for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases .
[INTRODUCTION] Due to very high dimensional nature of genomic data ( i. e. , very large number of variants ) , sharing even summary statistics , and other related intermediate data , or simply the existence of variants ( e. g. , beacons [ 21-23 ] ) can create risks of membership inference , i. e. , whether an individual with known genotypes participated a study . Although some related research has been proposed to provide secure GWAS , most of them focus on adopting federated methods in χ2 statistics test , Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) [ 40-42 ] , and linear/logistic regression tests . Among these methods , linear mixed models ( LMMs ) have been popularly used for analyzing continuous traits , their intrinsic assumptions ( uniform distribution of residuals with respect to variant allele frequency ) may bias analyses of the binary traits . Although statistical modeling has advanced in recent years , the real utility of data can be only realized when large sample sizes and more diverse populations are available to identify salient genetic variants . The most popular approach for correcting the confounding by kinship is to introduce an additive polygenic term that is distributed as a zero-mean multivariate Gaussian whose covariance matrix is proportional to the genetic relatedness matrix ( or kinship matrix ) among the subjects ( S1 Fig ) . With the increasing concerns about misusing genome data , regulations like Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) and General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR
[RESULTS] Although a curious entity may be able to build partial family trees and assign phenotypes , it is not immediately clear how these can be used for re-identifying individuals since most families will be of similar size with no immediate way to distinguish them in terms of phenotypic patterns . If cloud usage is not viable , our results indicate that the HE-based null model fitting followed by the scoring strategy that uses OTP-like protection with G⊤P matrices quantized to 32-bits can be accomplished in approximately 210 Gbytes of
[DISCUSSION] We also believe that the two-stage significance estimation is advantageous from a privacy preserving perspective because the overall problem is modularized in specific steps of null model fitting and variant scoring where covariates and genotype information is used in different stages . However , it should be noted that FedGMMAT 's null model contains very small number of parameters ( on the order to 10-20 ) and we foresee that it is unlikely that the global model parameters can lead to reliable membership or reconstruction attacks . Due to these challenges , the sites may choose to perform meta-analyses by sharing only the summary statistics , which requires much less computational burden on the sites with low privacy concerns . Thus , our future work will focus on refining the current method by adding secure multi-computation protections , embedding a tree-based asynchronous communication framework , and using lightweight communication protocols . In the future , this can in turn enable a tiered privacy-enabling design for GWAS such that different information is protected at different levels as required by local regulations . FedGMMAT is flexible to integrate multiple subject-level random effects and can be used in different study designs without explicit changes to the algorithmic setup and formulations . For instance , these studies must be designed and planned way ahead of time to collect harmonized and uniform data at independent sites

[ABSTRACT] In this study , we benchmark the predictive power of six widely used PRS derivation algorithms , including four of which adjust for ancestry , against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts . We find modest improvement in discriminatory ability when compared with a simple method that prioritizes variants , clumping , and published polygenic risk scores . While their accuracy continues to improve , research aimed at enhancing their effectiveness within African and Asian populations remains key for equitable use . Recent algorithmic developments for PRS derivation have resulted in improved pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases . Our findings underscore the importance of improving upon risk prediction algorithms and the sampling of diverse cohorts . Polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ) offer promising advancements in predicting disease risk , including prostate cancer . Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-biased incidence and mortality .
[INTRODUCTION] However , given ancestry-associated PCa incidence and outcome biases , it is imperative that risk scores work equally well across populations in order to limit disparities . Although genome-wide associations studies ( GWASs ) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) associated with PCa risk , they have primarily been conducted in European-ancestry cohorts [ 6-8 ] . Next , we trained polygenic risk score models using the largest GWAS summary data from the ELLIPSE Prostate Cancer Meta-Analysis cohorts and tuning dataset from the UK Biobank . The challenge of integrating genetic findings with the well-powered European-based GWAS results has led to the development of several methods that correct the biases within the European ancestry results [ 13-17 ] . Polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ) , which combine risk associated with multiple variants into a single risk score , are usually created using SNPs derived from these GWASs . Several genetic and environmental factors such as age , body mass index ( BMI ) , family history and ancestry are strong risk factors for developing PCa . Consequently , PRSs may share the population-bias of the European ancestry-based GWAS and can not be confidently applied to non-European populations . The variability in complexity and correction efficiency across these methods presents an opportunity to systematically analyze their performance in PCa . Admixture mapping and meta analyses have revealed rare and common risk alleles specific to men of African ancestry [ 10-12 ] . Prostate cancer ( PCa ) is the most commonly diagnosed tumor type in American men , accounting for 26 % of all cancer cases . In this study
[RESULTS] Although our study did not establish age as a significant modifier of disease risk among African and Asian populations , possibly due to the limitations in sample size , we observed that 78 out of 206 analyzed scores indicated an elevated risk in individuals under 55 years ( Odds ratio > 1 , FDR < 0 . Given that an ancestry-informed meta-analysis resulted in improved prostate cancer risk prediction in AFR , we hypothesized that additional rigorous adjustment of cross-population linkage disequilibrium and population allele may improve predictive power in AFR men . As
[DISCUSSION] Additionally , it is possible that individuals annotated as AFR may represent distinct subpopulations , considering the vast genetic diversity within Africa , and the dissimilarity may be heightened between continents ( Europe vs North America ) . Given the dramatic diversity in incidence and outcome data across ancestry groups , poorly performing risk prediction tools may compromise risk stratification and patient care , particularly for those most likely to be afflicted . While there is no consensus on PRS evaluation metrics and several studies report pseudo-R2 , odds ratio or AUROC , we show that alternative metrics such as AUROC produce a different ranking of polygenic risk scores . We find that while PRScsx explains the greatest amount of variance in logistic classifier models , it does not outperform other methods in classification accuracy on held-out data . These algorithms are based on variant prioritization , continuous shrinkage , joint analysis of summary statistics , functional annotation , fine mapping and the utilization of population-specific heritability estimates . Additionally , it is possible that whole genome sequencing , rather than array-based genotyping , may capture additional ancestry-biased causal variants , yielding improved risk prediction . Lastly , we note that polygenic score and the age of an individual are sufficient for acceptable classification of prostate cancer cases and controls across ancestries . However , most individuals are admixed , and each admixture component has further fine-scale population structure that may prevent portability ( e.
[METHODS] These four sets of summary statistics underwent standard quality control procedures which removed variants with missing statistics , duplicated rs IDs , alleles that were not A/C/T/G , ambiguous , not found in the UK Biobank imputed set , or that would not properly flip to match the alleles of the UK Biobank .

[ABSTRACT] Loss of both dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model , suggesting that dopaminergic flux and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DPAGT1 deficiency . We performed a drug repurposing screen on this model using 1 , 520 small molecules that are 98 % FDA/EMA-approved to find drugs that improved its eye . Notably from this screen , we found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DPAGT1-CDG model . These drugs and subsequent analyses reveal novel biology in DPAGT1 mechanisms , and they may represent new therapeutic options for DPAGT1-CDG . We also genetically validate other top drug categories including acetylcholine-related drugs , COX inhibitors , and an inhibitor of NKCC1 . This links dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation and represents a new potential therapeutic target for treating DPAGT1-CDG . It is caused by mutations in the gene DPAGT1 which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation . We used a Drosophila rough eye model of DPAGT1-CDG with an improperly developed , small eye phenotype . DPAGT1-CDG is a Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation ( CDG ) that lacks effective therapies . We identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DPAGT1-CDG model .
[INTRODUCTION] When successful , drug repurposing screens provide immediate potential therapeutics that have already passed the rigor of human safety trials and may have a faster route of clinical approval . DPAGT1 is part of the N-glycosylation pathway where these sugars are added to specific asparagine ( N ) residues , typically part of the canonical consensus sequence N-X-S/T where X is a non-proline amino acid . Even if a repurposed screen does not immediately result in a new therapy , it can still identify new biological interactions that can increase our understanding of a disorder . The compounds and pathways identified in this screen are potential new therapeutic and genetic interactions with DPAGT1 that may represent new treatment options for DPAGT1-CDG . In this study , we performed a drug repurposing screen on a Drosophila model of DPAGT1-CDG to identify new therapeutics and biological interactions with DPAGT1 . However , both of these treatments are palliative , and there remains a great need for better therapeutics for the multisystemic symptoms in DPAGT1-CDG . Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that increase acetylcholine levels can alleviate muscle weakness symptoms in both DPAGT1-CDG and -CMS patients [ 17-19 ] . One solution to find new therapeutics is drug repurposing which use drugs that are already approved or under investigation . DPAGT1-CDG is a rare disease that results from autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme DPAGT1 . Importantly , we find that both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of the D2 receptor can partially rescue our DPAGT1 model . Drosophila share ~75 % of human disease-causing genes
[RESULTS] Matching the pharmacological data from the primary screen , reduced expression of Dop2R using RNAi resulted in a strong improvement of eye size across all RNAi lines and replicates tested ( Fig 3D and 3E and S3 Table ) , compared to other tested drug and RNAi treatments . We focused our validation efforts on suppressors that had ≥3 drugs in a particular drug class , had the strongest suppressive effect on eye size ( Z-score ≥2 ) , or had high potential for patient use ( e. g. available over-the-counter
[DISCUSSION] While it is possible that the N-glycosylation status of a particular targeted protein is important for a specific drug hit , we found no general correlation between N-glycosylation status and suppressor or enhancer hits . It is possible that these MAOIs were enhancers because they increased the amount of DA in the presynaptic neuron , in line with our data on DA synthesis and recycling . We found that drug classes involving acetylcholine signaling , dopamine ( DA ) synthesis , histamine receptors , NKCC1/2 , and cyclooxygenase inhibition might be good candidates for treating DPAGT1-CDG ( Fig 8 ) . While only two NSAIDs improved our model , this category may still be promising for DPAGT1-CDG given their high usage and ease of patient access . We previously found that loss of the deglycosylating enzyme NGLY1 results in reduced NKCC1 activity , and other studies find that inhibiting N-glycosylation reduces the function of NKCC1 and NKCC2 . We hypothesize that under DPAGT1 impairment , any Ncc69 that is expressed may be misglycosylated and subsequently may be misfolded , or have aberrant function , and contribute to disease pathogenesis . While now discontinued in the US ( via PubChem ) , tolmetin was used for decades as an alternative to aspirin and has similarly few side effects . Given that bumetanide improved the eye development of the DPAGT1 model , it also suggests a role for bumetanide-like
[METHODS] Because there may be slight differences in drug concentrations from vendors or during food preparation , we considered drugs to validate if any of the three concentrations improved eye size ( after multiple comparison correction ) . We then replaced the ( TM3 , ser ) balancer with ( TM3 , Sb ) , self-crossed the line to ensure stability of the phenotype , and",,965,97,None,"A common disorder in humans is the Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation ( CDG ) .

We identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DPA GT1-CDG model .

[ABSTRACT] Our model provides a principled basis for understanding of sensorimotor representations , and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds , with applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots . The shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates despite the model having no knowledge of arm kinematics or hand coordinate systems . We developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity ( topo-VAE ) to compute a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data . Although not fitted to neural data , our model reproduces two sets of observations from monkey centre-out reaching : 1 . Even basic questions of how limb pose is represented in the somatosensory cortex are unclear . Proprioception is one of the least understood senses , yet fundamental for the control of movement . Encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of PDs . The distribution of neuronal preferred directions ( PDs ) recorded from multi-electrode arrays . Few neurons will encode just a single joint . The model makes several testable predictions : 1 . 2 . 2 .
[INTRODUCTION] We chose a small set of general computational elements that reflect principles and mechanisms found in sensory systems but have not been previously unified , which are as follows : Models should 1 ) use the information maximisation principle , which postulates that efficient sensory representations in the brain reflect natural sensory statistics , and implies that they are essential in shaping neural representations , 2 ) be stochastic , generative , and decodable , to reflect the natural variability in the data , produce neural activity to mimic that of the biological system , and offer the means to reconstruct the relevant original sensory input from its output , 3 ) implement , in Marr 's sense , neural computations that are performed by locally interacting neurons through synaptic interactions , rather than by an abstract computational machine . To overcome this limitation , we combined computational modelling and natural movement kinematic data to test hypotheses of organisational mechanisms that are currently beyond the capability of microarray recording techniques , where the distance between electrodes is too great to observe spatial organisation at the level of neighbouring neurons . Our chosen system was the proprioception of the right arm ( Fig 1A ) for which we had collected natural behavioural data from daily life in humans ( food preparation , eating , etc ; Figs 1B and S1 ) as well as constrained , planar centre-out reaching in both humans and monkeys ( Fig 1C ) . With further adjustments , such as replacing the linear decoder ( or even the MLP encoder )
[RESULTS] Two such features were compared ( Fig 3A ) : Half-peak widths measure how sharp the tuning of a neuron is , where smaller half-peak widths indicate sharper tuning , and velocity gradients measure how sharply the firing rate of a neuron changes as a function of the endpoint velocity in the direction of tuning ( note that the velocity gradient measurements were adjusted to control for differences in mean firing rate between modelled and recorded neurons ) . Similarly , removing either the excitatory ( purple curve in Fig 5A )
[DISCUSSION] While the relatively large spacing of electrodes used to record neural data from area 2 does not allow us to confirm the pinwheel anatomical structure directly , there are signatures of it in the recordings , such as the fact that neurons recorded on a given electrode tend to have more similar PDs than those recorded on separate electrodes-a necessary , but not sufficient property for proprioceptive pinwheels . This points towards the importance of working with training data that matches the natural distribution of stimuli when modelling sensory neurons , as it suggests important features of the neural code ( such as the complex receptive fields predicted by our model ) will only be elucidated under these conditions . While it is possible to reproduce the coding properties of individual neurons from convergence of peripheral inputs to a GLM , those models can tell us little about the role of neighbouring cells in shaping receptive fields or neuroanatomy-neural function relationships in general . Our model used only joint-based inputs ( i. e. , the kinematic state or pose of the arm ) but knows nothing about the musculoskeletal mechanics of the limb ( e. g. , the fact that bi-articulate muscles span multiple joints ) , beyond what can be inferred from correlations between joint angles . This enables a lateral interaction term between neighbouring neurons to be added , that shapes cortical activity into local neighbourhoods ,
[METHODS] The overall total loss function for optimising the topo-VAE model is therefore given by : Ln ( θ , ϕ ) =−Ez∼qθz∣xnlogpϕxn∣z+DKLqθz∣xn∣p ( z ) −γEz∼qθz∣xnTrzTΨz ( 10 ) where Ψ is a matrix representing the pairwise interactions between all the neuron indices in the range [ 1 , M ] , with each element Ψp , q = ψ ( p , q )",,934,95,None,"Proprioception is a fundamental sense of movement .

[ABSTRACT] Our data suggests a model in which ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasilense and re-wires its metabolism , suggesting that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing ethylene . Additionally , RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics showed that ethylene causes wide-spread metabolic changes that affect carbon and nitrogen metabolism . Treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces . We demonstrated that Azospirillum brasilense contains a functional ethylene receptor that we call Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 ( AzoEtr1 ) after the nomenclature used in plants . Ethylene is a plant hormone involved in many aspects of plant growth and development as well as responses to stress . The role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions has been explored from the perspective of plants . However , only a small number of studies have examined the role of ethylene in microbes . These data provide potential new targets to regulate beneficial plant-microbe interactions . One result is the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate . AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene with high affinity .
[INTRODUCTION] While the plant growth-promoting effects of A. brasilense have been described in most detail in cereals , the beneficial association of A. brasilense with plants is not restricted to cereals since they have been reported in many plant species across botanical families including Solanum lycopersicum ( tomato ) and Arabidopsis thaliana . PCC 6803 ( hereafter referred to as Synechocystis ) , contains a bifunctional receptor called Synechocystis ethylene response1 ( SynEtr1 ) for both ethylene and light with a signaling pathway that includes a down-stream response regulator protein and a small non-coding RNA . It is naturally found in soil and depending on conditions , such as compaction and water saturation , can reach concentrations above 10 ppm , which is well above the levels needed to elicit responses in plants [ 20-23 ] . The so-called `` rhizosphere effect '' , which describes the enhanced activity and density of microbes around the roots compared to the surrounding soil , plays a critical role in shaping the microbial rhizosphere communities which directly impact plant health and stress tolerance [ 1-4 ] . Future food security will require sustainable agricultural practices that ensure elevated crop productivity while reducing inputs from chemical fertilizers , particularly , nitrogen , which can have adverse environmental effects . There are multiple sources of ethylene in the soil , including biotic biosynthesis by plants , bacteria , and fungi , as well as abiotic sources such as photochemical production triggered when sunlight is absorbed by dissolved organics . Almost all research on ethylene as a signaling molecule has focused on its role
[RESULTS] For this we chose OH82_RS30850 ( annotated as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1 subunit beta ) and OH82_RS14895 ( annotated as an amino acid permease ) because our RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) showed that both of these genes are upregulated by the application of ethylene ( see next section ) . To evaluate the influence of ethylene on the ability of bacterial cells to colonize roots , we used ethylene insensitive 2-5 ( ein2-5 ) A. thaliana and never ripe ( nr ) tomato which do not respond to ethylene , so
[DISCUSSION] Thus , it is not unexpected that the impact of ethylene perception on bacterial behavior differs between these two organisms One point of similarity is that both organisms are very sensitive to ethylene with responses occurring as low as 1 ppb ethylene , which is below the threshold for most responses in plants . The measurements of these resources allow PII proteins , such as GlnB , to function at the center of the regulation of the balance between cellular carbon and nitrogen metabolism by interacting with many unrelated molecular targets to mediate cellular adaptation [ 68-73 , 77 , 103-106 ] . Ethylene levels in the soil are influenced by various factors , including compaction and water saturation and can range from trace amounts to above 10 ppm , which is well above the levels needed to elicit biological responses in plants [ 20-23 ] . Given the central role of 2-oxoglutarate in signaling to the PII proteins , this represents a possible mechanism by which ethylene shifts metabolism by making the bacteria partially `` blind '' to shifts in nitrogen availability leading to alterations in carbon and nitrogen metabolic processes . This is reflected in the upregulation of carbon metabolism genes such as the 1-phosphofrutokinase pfkB and several genes encoding for components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and downregulation of glnB which regulates the expression of other nitrogen assimilation ( amtB ) and nitrogen fixation ( nifH )
[METHODS] Biofilm formation was assayed by crystal violet staining in 12-well PVLC plates with the lid pierced above each well with a 27-gauge needle and covered with micropore surgical tape to ensure equal gas flow between the wells . Therefore , we cloned AzoEtr1 from A. brasilense Sp245 ( now known as A. baldaniorum ) and PCR amplified a truncated version ( the first 390 bp )",,920,94,None,"The role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions has been explored from the perspective of plants .

[ABSTRACT] These data suggest a role for INO80 in DNA repair factor localization , thereby facilitating the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachynema . The INO80 protein is the main catalytic subunit of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex , which is critical for DNA repair and transcription regulation in murine spermatocytes . A reduction in the recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition ( MSCI ) argues for INO80-facilitated recruitment of DNA repair factors required for silencing sex-linked genes . Furthermore , the active form of RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes of Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes . Instead , in the absence of INO80 , a reduction in chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites occurs on the sex chromosomes . In this study , we explored the role of INO80 in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice . INO80 immunolocalization at the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes suggested a role for INO80 in the meiotic sex body . Subsequent deletion of Ino80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes . This role of INO80 is independent of a common INO80 target , H2A . Z .
[INTRODUCTION] Extended prophase I during meiosis ensures the faithful execution of recombination to shuffle genetic material between homologous chromosomes by controlled introduction of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSB ) at the DSB hotspots by SPO11 followed by their repair . The sex chromosomes in spermatocytes undergo modifications by several DNA damage repair ( DDR ) factors such as BRCA1 , ATR , and its activator TOPBP1 at the unpaired ( asynapsed ) chromosome axes . Like other chromatin remodelers , INO80 is expressed in several mammalian tissues , including the testis , and was reported to facilitate development in a context-dependent manner . Mammalian gametogenesis involves the meiotic division of diploid germ cells that undergo homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination to generate haploid gametes . INO80 also facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair factors at the DSB sites and interacts with DSBR factors to facilitate the silencing of sex chromosomes . MSCI is initiated by DNA double-strand breaks ( DSB ) at the asynapsed axes and the incorporation of DSBR proteins at these DSB sites . There are four major families of chromatin remodeling complexes , all of which play critical functions in murine spermatogenesis [ 14-20 ] . In contrast , non-homologous regions of the X and Y sex chromosomes in male germ cells do not synapse with each other . However , it is unclear whether the chromatin remodeler INO80 plays any role in the meiotic silencing of the sex chromosomes . During pachynema , DNA double-strand break repair ( DSBR ) factors no longer localize to autosomes , indicating the completion of
[RESULTS] Further , genomic annotation analysis of these ATAC-peaks from sex chromosomes ( S2 Table ) suggested a significant increase in intronic ( 9 % to 19 % ) and distal intergenic ( 24 % to 51 % ) accessible regions during the transition from P12 to P18 ( S6E Fig ) . To investigate further the sex-linked gene expression in pachytene spermatocytes alone , we utilized meiotic germ cell synchronization to isolate homogeneous pachytene spermatocyte population from wild-type and mutant testes and quantified sex-linked gene expression by qRT-PCR . An upregulation
[DISCUSSION] While the exact mechanism of gene silencing by DSB factors is not clear , the de novo generation of accessible regions at the non-promoter areas may provide the open chromatin structure necessary for DSB factors to bind and , therefore , explain the resulting gene silencing by them during MSCI . Moreover , unaltered gene expression signatures for zygonema and pachynema stages in Ino80cKO spermatocytes at P18 , derived from RNAseq data comparing Ino80WT and Ino80cKo spermatocytes , suggest their relative proportions remain similar , except for a reduced transition from pachynema to diplonema in the absence of INO80 . Utilizing this small window of time , we observed a lack of downregulation of sex-linked differentially expressed genes in Ino80cKO spermatocytes , which was also replicated by comparing homogeneous pachynema populations upon synchronization of spermatogenesis . However , it is logical to predict INO80 as a central regulator of sex-linked gene silencing by regulating this de novo accessibility generation , as most of these peaks are lost in Ino80cKO spermatocytes . However , INO80-dependent silencing of sex-linked genes in meiotic spermatocytes is independent of INO80-mediated direct transcriptional regulation by enabling DNA binding factor recruitment at the promoter-proximal areas . X-binding DSB regions and reduced MDC1 occupancy at the DA sites in sex chromosomes due to Ino80 deletion indicate a possible INO80-dependent recruiting mechanism for DSBR factor MDC1 . We also validated this overall aberrant sex-linked transcription program in
[METHODS] Relative signal intensity was measured by NIH ImageJ software ( S6 Table ) , either at an area marked by a region of interest with assigning the lowest intensity a value of 1 or along a single line transect as described previously .

[ABSTRACT] We find that the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the cdd-2 defect in axon regeneration . These results suggest that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor through modification of svh-1 mRNA . SVH-1 is a dual-function factor that acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a protease to regulate early development . Furthermore , the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1 . The pathway for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans is activated by SVH-1 , a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family . In this study , we demonstrate that cytidine deaminase ( CDD ) SVH-17/CDD-2 plays a role in the functional conversion of SVH-1 . It is important to understand how SVH-1 is converted from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration .
[INTRODUCTION] In this study , we investigated the relationship between cdd-2 and svh-1 in the regulation of axon regeneration , and show that CDD-2 is required for axon regeneration by converting SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor . Therefore , SVH-1 has a dual-function : it acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a plasminogen-like protease required for larval development ( Fig 1A ; ) . We have genetically identified several genes ( svh ) involved in the JNK signaling pathway that regulates axon regeneration , including the svh-17/cdd-2 gene encoding cytidine deaminase ( CDD ) . However , unlike plasminogen , HGF lacks the Asp-His-Ser triad , which is essential for catalytic activity and can not function as a protease ( Fig 1A ; ) . Injured neurons need to receive accurate and timely information about the extent of axonal damage to successfully increase their intrinsic growth capacity and regenerate . The ability of neurons to regenerate after injury is determined by a complex interplay between their intrinsic growth program and external cues . The pathway is activated by a signaling cascade involving the mammalian HGF-like growth factor , SVH-1 , and its receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) , SVH-2 . Recent studies have identified the JNK MAP kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway as a key intrinsic regulator of regeneration initiation in C. elegans . Therefore , there must be a switch mechanism that converts SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor to function in axon regeneration ( Fig 1B ) . The sequence homology of SVH-1 to HGF and
[RESULTS] When svh-1 ( H755Y ) or svh-1 ( S898F ) was expressed from the srh-220 promoter in cdd-2 ( km70 ) mutants , we found that H755Y , but not S898F , was able to suppress the cdd-2 ( km70 ) defect ( Fig 4B and S1 Table ) , suggesting that CDD-2 mediates C-to-U editing of svh-1 mRNA , replacing His-755 at the protease catalytic site with tyrosine and producing protease-inactive and growth factor-active SVH-1 . We found that the svh-1 ( s-mut , H755Y ) mutation was able to rescue the axon
[DISCUSSION] However , in contrast to this scenario , the protease-active and growth factor-active isoforms of SVH-1 act in the same cell ( ADL neuron ) to regulate larval development during the L1 stage and axon regeneration during the L4-adult stages , respectively . Our genetic results suggest that CDD-2 deaminates the C of svh-1 mRNA to U , replacing His-755 ( CAU ) with tyrosine ( UAU ) in the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad , producing a protease-inactive and growth factor-active SVH-1 . Furthermore , although the svh-1 reporter gene with the nls : :venus-fused svh-1 promoter demonstrated expression exclusively in ADL neurons , data from the CeNGEN project indicated that transcripts of svh-1 were detected in other neurons in addition to ADL neurons . Thus , the protease-inactive SVH-1 ( S898F ) can function as a growth factor only when His-755 is substituted with Tyr-755 in svh-1 mRNA by CDD-2 , suggesting that SVH-1 with His-755 can not interact with or activate SVH-2 . Forced cdd-2 expression at the L1 stage does not lead to the editing of svh-1 mRNA , suggesting that the enzymatic activity of CDD-2 may be activated by axon injury . Thus , cdd-2 expression at a specific developmental stage is essential for the functional conversion of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor during axon regeneration . Upon axon injury , CDD-2-dependent editing and subsequent translation of svh-1 mRNA occurs , resulting in the production of SVH-1
[METHODS] An F1 animal carrying the transgene was picked , and genomic DNA from its descendants was amplified by PCR and digested with AciI to detect short insertions or deletions in the cdd-2 gene . The pU6 : :cdd-2_sgRNA plasmid ( 160 ng/μl ) was co-injected together with the Peft-3 : :cas9-sv40_nls : :tbb-2 3′-UTR ( 30 ng/μl ) and Pmyo-2 : :dsred-monomer ( 20 ng/μl ) plasmids",,936,95,None,"Injured neurons need to receive accurate and timely information about the extent of axonal damage to successfully increase their intrinsic growth capacity and regenerate .

[ABSTRACT] We show that the collective behaviour of wildtype and col11a2 -/- zebrafish are captured with a simple active matter model , in which the mutant fish are modelled by self-propelling agents with a higher orientational noise on average . In a few cases , the system may be controlled at the level of the individual constituents such as the interactions between colloidal particles , or the enzymatic behaviour of de novo proteins . Zebrafish collective behaviour is widely used to assess their physical and mental state , serving as a valuable tool to assess the impact of ageing , disease genetics , and the effect of drugs . In this way , we demonstrate the possibility of tuning a biological system , changing the state space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active matter model . The essence of these macroscopic phenomena can be represented by active matter models , where the individuals are abstracted as interactive self-propelling agents . We thus demonstrate the potential of genetic modification in the context of controlling the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems at the level of the constituents , rather than externally . The resulting col11a2 -/- zebrafish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties , bent their body less while swimming , and took longer to change their orientations . Usually , however , while the collective behaviour may be influenced by environmental factors , it typically can not be changed at will . The behaviour of these agents depends on a set of parameters in a manner reminiscent of those between the constituents of physical systems . In particular , we probe the effect of the lack of col11a2 gene in zebrafish , which causes the early onset of osteoarthritis . Surprisingly , a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype . Here , we challenge this scenario in a biological context by genetically modifying zebrafish .
[INTRODUCTION] For example , synthetic active colloids are an idealised playground to understand the principles of active matter , exhibiting dynamical or structural [ 33-35 ] transitions , complex plasmas constitute particulate systems with tunable behaviour , while the emergence of de novo proteins enables design of enzymatic behaviour . While often this is forbidden by nature ( the immutable laws of quantum mechanics in the case of atoms ) or impractical ( it is hard to control large bird flocks for example ) , some systems are amenable to the design of their constituents . For this purpose , we use the zebrafish system , which has a well-established collective behaviour that can be monitored in the laboratory by tracking the individual fish [ 38-40 ] and which is amenable to genetic modification [ 41-44 ] . In this way , when interpreted through a simple active matter model , the state space accessed by the fish is controlled at the level of each individual in a manner analogous to simple tunable systems such as colloids . Interestingly , we found that the col11a2 mutant zebrafish exhibited limited vertebral column bending during swimming , and they took a significantly longer time to change their swim direction than wildtype . By studying groups of mutant zebrafish , we can investigate how changes in individuals lead to collective behaviour and explore the underlying biological mechanisms that drive these emergent phenomena .
[RESULTS] The Vicsek model is a minimal model where the simulated agents only interact with each other via local orientational alignment , and this model can be modified to match the fish behaviour , simply by adding an inertial term such that the velocity vi of each agent ( fish ) is updated as , v i ( t + 1 ) = v 0 Θ [ ( 1 - α ) v 0 R η [ Θ ( ∑ j ∈ S i
[DISCUSSION] Taken together we have shown that by modelling the swimming behaviour of zebrafish and treating them as active matter , we can reveal physiologically relevant behaviours that are underpinned by changes to the skeleton , demonstrating the utility of this approach as a tool to follow genetic mutants and relate behaviours to genetic traits and to phsyiological changes within the body . This behavioural difference of a single fish affected the group behaviour of twenty five , where the mutant fish group exhibited more ordered collective motion that correlates with their more persistent swimming style . This is interpreted as the mutant fish system adopting a different state space with respect to the wild-type in the context of a minimalistic physical model . In particular the difference between mutant and wild-type fish can be summarised by different orientational noise level in a modified Vicsek model . The genetic modification caused defects in the vertebral column of mutants , leading to less body-bending in swimming , hence a slower reorientation process . Our work describes a quantitative study on the behavioural difference between wild-type zebrafish and the col11a2 -/- zebrafish whose col11a2 gene is knocked out ( suppressed ) . In other words , we have tuned the behaviour of a biological system in a manner

The essence of these macroscopic phenomena can be represented by active matter models , where the individuals are abstracted as interactive self-propelling agents . In a few cases , the system may be controlled at the level of the individual constituents such as the interactions between colloidal particles , or the enzymatic behaviour of de novo proteins . Here , we challenge this scenario in a biological context by genetically modifying zebrafish . We show that the collective behaviour of wildtype and col11a2 -/- zoote is captured with a simple active matter model , in which the mutant fish are modelled by self-proxelling organisms with higher orientational noise on average . Surprisingly , a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype ."

[INTRODUCTION] For different purposes , researchers have designed various biogels composed of specific components , such as the mixing of collagen and gelatin to simulate the environments where proteins are denatured in burns and scalds or the coated fibronectin on scaffolds to study the fibronectin structures and functions for cell attachment promotion . The long-term incubations , on the other hand , are generally over weeks or months to allow for the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) or the functional proteins secreted from cells , mimicking the realistic environments for capillary growth and showing potential for applications such as wound healing and transplanting [ 8-10 ] . The CPM framework , viewing individual cells moving on a fixed grid , can be traced back to Graner and Glazier , who extended the Potts model with several constraints suitable for living cells , and the cell alliances tended to be stable . followed and simplified Murray and Oster 's equations into two-dimensional by considering the migration of endothelial cells limited on the upper layer of the matrix , successfully obtaining the mechanical force-induced visualized pattern of non-uniform distributed cells . published a mechanical-based hybrid model with their successful simulations of cell networks and sprouts , showing that the capillary-like structures could develop via the pure stress and strain mechanisms between cells and substrates . Fibronectin is a biomaterial widely studied in recent years for its integrin-binding sub-domains , which can bind the integrin on the cellular membrane to stabilize the cell attachment . Cell-based models , such as the cellular Potts model ( CPM ) , were developed to consider cell individual behaviors using

Unlike the typical case with both the cellular morphology and
[DISCUSSION] Furthermore , for the practical transplantation into living bodies to promote neovascularization around the surgical site , an extension of our model may cover the extracellular remodeling and endothelial cell morphology in the future . The soluble VEGF in the culture medium induces morphological changes , and the bound VEGF on the biogel surface provides oriental signals , both playing roles in forming the capillary-like networks . The results were consistent with the experiments , showing that the cellular network was well-developed if the mechanical and chemical coupling worked simultaneously . We have developed a comprehensive model encompassing mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation cues for forming capillary-like networks . The simulation successfully demonstrated that cells gathered from scattered individuals to cell cords and then from the cell cords to an overall network . The model covers the respective mechanisms of two VEGF forms on endothelial cells . The current model is valid for short-term static incubation .

[ABSTRACT] Finally , we show that canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens , while components of the DAF-7 TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway do not play a major role in survival . These results demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens . The Transforming Growth Factor beta ( TGF-β ) family consists of numerous secreted peptide growth factors that play significant roles in cell function , tissue patterning , and organismal homeostasis , including wound repair and immunity . As in vertebrates , these ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) and TGF-β/Activin subfamilies that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways . Typically studied as homodimers , these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that may enhance , repress , or generate novel functions . In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , there are only five TGF-β ligands , providing an opportunity to dissect ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates . Additionally , we identify TIG-2 and TIG-3 as members of a rare subset of TGF-β ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers . We show that the two BMP-like ligands-DBL-1 and TIG-2-function independently of each other in the immune response , while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-β/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function together . The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans . Here we show that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogens . We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs act nonredundantly as part of this response . Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers .
[INTRODUCTION] Previous work from our lab and others has demonstrated that the BMP homolog DBL-1 functions in the innate immune response of C. elegans to pathogenic bacteria and fungi by inducing the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes in response to pathogen exposure [ 35-38 ] . This signaling family also plays an important role in the post-developmental adult in maintaining homeostasis and repair [ 3 , 5-7 ] , as well as serving as one of the highly conserved signaling mechanisms involved in the immune response [ 8-14 ] . UNC-129 , TIG-2 , and TIG-3 have been classified ( as BMP-like or TGF-β-like ) based on their structural characteristics but have not been fully associated with all members of either the BMP-like or TGF-β-like signaling pathways in C. elegans . Here we demonstrate that the DBL-1 ligand is only one of four TGF-β family ligands with a significant role in the immune response to two gram-negative bacterial pathogens . In contrast , we have shown a non-additive relationship between TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-β/Activin-like TIG-3 , suggesting that these two distinct ligands act together in the immune response . The TGF-β-like ligand DAF-7 is the regulator of the dauer pathway , and its expression in favorable conditions prevents entry into the dauer larval stage , an alternative third larval ( L3 ) stage specialized for harsh environmental conditions . The canonical TGF-β family signaling cascade is initiated by binding of
[RESULTS] Survival analysis directly comparing dbl-1 and sma-3 mutants on P. luminescens demonstrates that while both strains have a decreased survival pattern as compared to control , sma-3 mutants have a significantly reduced survival rate compared to dbl-1 mutants ( Fig 5A ) , suggesting that SMA-3 is responding to other signaling ligands instead of or in addition to DBL-1 . The DBL-1 pathway has been thoroughly studied in response to exposure to the gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens , where the worm 's survival
[DISCUSSION] These studies were initiated with the well-characterized BMP-like DBL-1 signaling pathway , which is associated with significant roles in development and body size regulation but has also been shown to play an important role in the immune response against both bacterial and fungal pathogens . Interaction between BMP and TGFβ/Activin subfamily members may provide a mechanism for distinguishing developmental and homeostatic ligand functions from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens . The nematode C. elegans has five TGF-β ligands and two characterized TGF-β family signaling pathways , providing a powerful in vivo system in which to study TGF-β ligand functions in the context of an intact organism . These results suggest that the function of DBL-1 in the immune response is not a general one-size-fits-all response to bacterial pathogen but rather a more nuanced response with some level of pathogen specificity . However , joint action between a BMP and TGF-β/Activin ligand , including potential cross-subfamily heterodimers , has not yet been described in vertebrates to our knowledge , and warrants further consideration . The TGF-β/Activin-like ligands DAF-7 and TIG-3 demonstrated consistently significant reduced survival patterns on P. luminescens , suggesting involvement of these ligands in the response to this bacterial pathogen . We have shown that SMA-3/Smad is required

[ABSTRACT] Delving deeper into its effects on the DNA damage signaling cascade , nat4-deleted cells exhibit lower levels of the damage-induced modification H2AS129ph ( γH2A ) , accompanied by diminished binding of the checkpoint control protein Rad9 surrounding the double-strand break . Here , we show that the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 ( Nat4 ) , known to acetylate the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2A , is implicated in the response to DNA damage in S. cerevisiae . Importantly , we found that the effects of Nat4 in regulating the checkpoint signaling cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4 . Overall , this study points towards a novel functional link between histone N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and the DDR , associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity . Initially , we demonstrate that yeast cells lacking Nat4 have an increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells . Consistently , Mec1 kinase recruitment at double-strand breaks , critical for H2AS129ph deposition and Rad9 retention , is significantly impaired in nat4Δ cells . Accordingly , upon DNA damage , NAT4 gene expression is elevated , and the enzyme is specifically recruited at double-strand breaks . Consequently , Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effector kinase Rad53 , indicative of DNA damage checkpoint activation , is reduced . This biological process involves substantial alterations in chromatin structure , commonly orchestrated by epigenetic enzymes . The DNA damage response ( DDR ) constitutes a vital cellular process that safeguards genome integrity .
[INTRODUCTION] Importantly , it has been demonstrated that Nat4-associated N-terminal acetylation ( Nt-Ac ) affects critical cellular processes including chromatin function and regulation of gene expression , which in turn influences biological phenotypes like cellular aging , metabolic rewiring , and cancer progression [ 10-14 ] . In yeast , H2AS129ph is the first DNA-damage induced modification to arise in the vicinity of the break , also known as γΗ2A , and spreads over 50kb on both sides flanking the DSB stabilizing checkpoint factors and inhibiting further DNA end resection [ 28-30 ] . Notably , Nat4 acetyltransferase activity targeting histone H4 is crucial for its DDR function and checkpoint dynamics as evidenced by the deregulated DDR signaling in cells bearing a catalytically inactive Nat4 or expressing the non-acetylated H4S1A histone mutant . Despite perpetual DSBs from both endogenous and environmental stressors , as well as exogenous DNA-damaging agents like methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) , cells have evolved mechanisms to counteract this threat , collectively termed as DNA damage response ( DDR ) . Unlike almost all other identified NATs that target a wide variety of substrates , both yeast Nat4 and hNAA40 function as a monomer and selectively N-terminally acetylate serine 1 ( S1 ) on histones H4 ( Nt-AcH4 ) and H2A ( Nt-AcH2A ) . Once activated , DDC limits extensive resection to prevent excessive accumulation of ssDNA through various mechanisms , as well as amplifies the signal for cell cycle arrest and induction of DNA repair
[RESULTS] Interestingly , in yeast cells expressing hNAA40 , the global distribution of H2AS129ph during MMS treatment , as well as Rad53 phosphorylation levels were rescued back to wild-type levels ( Fig 5A and 5B ) , indicating that Nat4 effects in DDR and checkpoint signaling are mediated through N-terminal acetylation of histone H4 and not of H2A . After MMS-induced damage , both H2AS129ph levels and Rad53 phosphorylation were similarly reduced in the double mutant strain H4S1Anat4Δ as in the single H4S1A and nat4Δ mutants ( Fig
[DISCUSSION] Remarkably , we found that there is substantial reduction in Mec1 ( Figs 3D , 4C and 6D ) and Rad9 ( Fig 3C ) enrichment at the induced DSBs in nat4Δ cells but , this is not reflected in Rad53 phosphorylation whose reduction is considerably less pronounced ( Figs 3E , 4D and 6E ) . In Nat4-deficient cells , we observed reduced recruitment of Mec1 ( Figs 3D , 4C and 6D ) whose loss is known to indirectly accelerate resection by affecting Rad9 binding at DSB sites [ 24 , 25 , 30 , 35-38 , 51 ] . Additionally , we showed that in nat4Δ cells there is defective DDC activation , evident by reduced Rad53 phosphorylation ( Figs 3E , 4D and 6E ) , while it was previously shown that DNA end resection is inhibited in a checkpoint-dependent manner . In summary , our work unveils a new role for Nat4 in DDR , which serves as a paradigm among the NAT family of enzymes and their mediated protein N-terminal acetylation in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage . Since these Set2-associated effects are similar to the results presented here for nat4Δ and the H4S1A mutant , future work could explore the interplay between these and other epigenetic modifiers upon DNA damage to control the DDR . 6kb
[METHODS] Briefly , cells were grown in YP-Raffinose and synchronized in G2/M with nocodazole for 5h ( necessary as DNA end resection is cell-cycle regulated ) , and remained arrested with nocodazole throughout the experiment , ensuring consistency in the cell cycle phase during the assessment of DNA end resection dynamics . Sonicated chromatin was diluted 10-fold in IP buffer ( 1 %",,980,97,None,"Cells have evolved mechanisms to counteract the DNA damage response ( DDR ) , a crucial cellular process that safeguards genome integrity .

Moreover , Mec1 kinases recruitment at double-strand breaks , critical for H2AS129ph deposition and Rad9 retention , are significantly impaired in nat4 cells , suggesting that Nat4 is involved in the DDR associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity and a novel function of the enzyme in the regulation of DNA damage checkpoint activation ."

[ABSTRACT] Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALLs ) . Additionally , we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations . Phylogenies depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer , i. e. , cancer phylogenies , offer valuable insights about cancer development and guide treatment strategies . However , these methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations , or , in some cases , fail to recover a phylogeny altogether . Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially , generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations . Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies , a novel result derived in this paper . Here , we introduce Orchard , a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate using up to 1000 mutations . Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny . Many methods exist that reconstruct cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing . Remarkably , Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies using up to 1 , 000 mutations .
[INTRODUCTION] These existing algorithmic approaches have critical pitfalls : MCMC-based methods often converge slowly and are prone to becoming stuck in local maxima because samples are highly auto-correlated , while MILP-based methods can be extremely slow , may fail to recover a solution , or may only be able to produce a single solution in a reasonable amount of time . Orchard avoids these pitfalls because of two crucial properties of the algorithm : it samples without replacement , which mitigates the risk of becoming stuck in local maxima , and its search strategy retains and grows partial tree structures that adhere closely to the ISA , effectively pruning large portions of the search space . Pre-defining subclones before tree reconstruction can also result in the loss of critical information such as the partial order of mutation acquisition , which is crucial for analyzing somatic mutation patterns and determining prognosis and treatment strategies for certain hematological cancers [ 6 , 7 , 34-36 ] . This approach differs from existing methods , such as Pairtree , which uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) to explore the space of complete mutation trees , or CALDER , which formulates the MSPP problem as a mixed integer linear program ( MILP ) . Phylogenies describing the ancestral relationships of subclones in an individual cancer can reveal important evolutionary events , help to characterize the cancer 's heterogeneity and progression , support the discovery of new driver mutations , and provide clinical insight for treatment regimens . Clustering
[RESULTS] This figure presents a heatmap of the absolute differences between the VAFs inferred by Pairtree and those implied by the bulk data for each mutation , and it shows that Pairtree 's inferred VAFs significantly diverge from those implied by the bulk data , indicating a poor reconstruction . We ran Orchard , CALDER , and Pairtree on each simulated data set a single time , and the box plots in Fig 3b , 3c and 3d show the distribution of results for each evaluation metric . Again
[DISCUSSION] One potential improvement , because the frequency of most mutations should not be changed by introducing a new mutation into the tree , is developing a new version of the projection algorithm that only performs local updates to the U matrix . We anticipate that improvements to the current algorithm to make it probabilistic , so that its merging choices are made based on an appropriate likelihood function , will result in even greater performance . Our results demonstrate that Orchard can reliably match or beat ground-truth ( or expert-derived ) baselines on tree reconstruction problems with up to 300 mutations and up to 100 samples from the same cancer . Although the computational complexity for estimating U is , at worst , quadratic in the number of mutations ( i. e. , rows ) in U , the wall clock times grows quickly with increasing problem size , beam width ( k ) , or branching factor ( f ) . Also , Orchard marginalizes over all possible ways to place a new mutation into a partially built tree , which requires an exponential number of evaluations when the tree is a star tree , i. e. , a tree where all mutations are children of the root . Despite this , the algorithm already matches , or in some cases , outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic VAF-based clustering algorithms on
[METHODS] According to Cayley 's formula , ( n + 1 ) n−1 unique mutation trees can be constructed with n mutations and a root node r. Consequently , if D contains data for a large number of mutations , then it is intractable to compute the normalizing constant , P ( D ) = ∑B ∫U P ( B , U , D",,951,96,None,"Cancer phylogenies can reveal the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer .

[INTRODUCTION] ImmugenX and the models benchmarked in this work focus on HLA class I presented epitopes , recognised by CD8+ T-cells , as the definition of immunogenicity ; however , a similar architecture and training approach could in future be applied to class II and CD4+ reactivities . We show that ImmugenX achieves a state-of-the-art level of performance at pMHC immunogenicity on an independent cancer-specific holdout and is extendable to include additional features when they are available . Due to low volumes of training data and small independent test datasets , these models have generally shown improved performance at the time of publication but some reduced performance on new data as it becomes available . While these datasets are currently limited in scope , next-generation screening methods may greatly increase volumes of paired data in the coming years , meaning an increase in TCR data from which to retrain existing models . Poor generalisation is likely due to a shortage of diverse datasets since the current repositories of paired pMHC-TCR triplets are heavily biased to HLA-A02:01 and a few viral epitopes . Efforts have also been made to automatically benchmark existing models as new data becomes available , with current findings showing strong agreement between several models with overall high performance . A smaller number of models have been reported that predict other pMHC formation-related metrics such as pMHC stability , as measured by dissociation assays , and TAP transport efficiency . Newer versions of netMHCpan , MHCFlurry and comparable models such as MixMHCpred are trained to predict whether peptides are naturally eluted ligands (
[RESULTS] Prediction of TCR specificity from triplets with unseen epitopes has been shown to be limited in recent studies and reviews , with results showing above chance performance can be explainable by data leakage from training sets or underlying frequency shifts between data sources . To demonstrate the utility of ImmugenX as an architecture for immunogenicity prediction utilising the full peptide-MHC-TCR triplet input , we initially compare it to two recent TCR specificity models using data splits provided by the authors to provide a fair comparison . Benchmark pools of 50 ,
[DISCUSSION] The current version of the model places more positional importance on known biologically relevant locations ; however , future version of the model will need to be reassessed in this manner to ensure spurious features are n't learned from any new datasets , which may not be apparent from benchmark scores alone . In our tests EL models perform very poorly on immunogenicity prediction due to the bias in which epitopes are tested being skewed to highly ranked epitopes ; however , these tools are still likely useful for minimal epitope selection compared to randomly selected epitopes from a given mutation . ImmugenX as an architecture demonstrated strong performance at two TCR specificity tasks from previous publications indicating that it is highly capable of integrating TCR inputs , including up to full chain alpha and beta chains , into predictions . The SHAP analysis of ImmugenX showed a more balanced use of residues in the immunogenicity-trained full model compared to the underlying pMHC sub-module trained on the BA , EL and stability tasks which was highly impacted by the associated HLA binding motifs . There exists a potential bias in reactivity datasets due to the use of BA/EL models to determine test candidates from called mutations , since these tools have biases associated with their training data acquisition methods . In this work , we 've described ImmugenX , a modular language model which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
[METHODS] For these benchmarking experiments full-length TCRs with both alpha and beta chains were used to compare to existing state-of-the-art models ; however , other configurations such as CDR3-beta only input are also possible with ImmugenX .

[ABSTRACT] The differences in meat color phenotypes , myoglobin content , frequency of rs315520807 variant , expression of PPP1CC and fast-twitch fiber marker genes were detected between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens . Here , we used the genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and gene-based association analysis with whole-genome resequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to map genes related to meat lightness and redness to a 6 . In this study , PPP1CC was identified as the causative gene for meat color , and the novel target gene and variant that can aid in the innovation of meat improvement technology were detected . Through transcriptome and targeted metabolome evidence , we found that inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of typical slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes and enhanced the glycolysis pathway . Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout ( PPP1CC-SSKO ) mice were generated and these mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in the limb muscles . Functional validation through a plasmid reporter assay revealed that a SNP located in the intron of PPP1CC could regulate the gene transcription activity .

[INTRODUCTION] However , this approach requires a time-inducible and skeletal muscle-specific knockout mouse model with a high degree of mimicry , in which normal gene expression during embryonic and early development ensures normal tissue development . Redness and yellowness are chromatically determined by pigment content , and lightness is chromatically determined by microstructure Meat color not only influences appearance but is also correlated with pH , muscle fiber characteristics and lipid deposition . Further experiments in inducible skeletal muscle-specific knockout ( SSKO ) mice verified the gene function , and the underlying regulatory mechanisms were revealed through targeted metabolome and transcriptome analyses . In the present study , the causative gene and potential causative variant of chicken breast muscle color lightness and redness were identified through a combination of GWAS , gene-based association analysis , and MR analysis . Strong relationships between beta-carotene oxygenase 1 ( BCO1 ) and chicken yellowness and between myosin heavy chain 3 ( MYH3 ) and redness/intramuscular fat in pig skeletal muscle have been reported . The MR method uses genetic variants to determine whether an observational association between a risk factor and an outcome trait is consistent with a causal effect . The knockout of a candidate gene that has broad roles and is functionally important at an early age will result in severe harm . The Rendement Napole gene ( RN ) and phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit gamma 1 ( PHKG1 ) were found to be involved in glycolytic potential .

[RESULTS] Targeted metabolomics analysis revealed that the significantly differently abundant metabolites fructose-1 , 6-BP , dihydroxyacetone phosphate , 3-phosphoglycerate/2-phospho-d-glyceric acid , and phosphoenolpyruvic acid involved in glycolysis were highly upregulated in PPP1CC-SSKO mice ( Fig 4B and S6 Table ) . To identify QTLs affecting chicken meat color , we performed a GWAS for the L * and a * values of breast muscle from 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens with 9 , 760 , 228 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) . At 9 weeks of age , the transcriptomes
[DISCUSSION] Using PPP1CC-SSKO mice , we also found that lightness increased and myoglobin content decreased in the limb muscle , and the mechanisms by which PPP1CC influences meat color included myofiber-type specification . We found that PPP1CC expression was causally related to breast muscle lightness and redness in chickens using large-scale genome-wide association , gene-based association analysis and Mendelian randomization analysis . Functional validation through a plasmid reporter assay revealed that the SNP rs315520807 ( C > T ) located in the intron of PPP1CC could regulate gene transcription activity . The differences in the meat color phenotypes and related indices between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens support the conclusions above . Our results identified PPP1CC as the causative gene for meat color and identified a novel target gene and variant for the innovation of meat improvement technology .
[METHODS] The meat color ( L * , a * , b * ) of the chicken pectoralis major muscle was measured using the CIELAB color space system ( Konica Minolta , CR-410 ) , which consists of opponent-color scales based on the opponent-color theory of human color vision , where a * indicates redness when positive and greenness when negative , b *",,918,94,None,"In this study , we used a combination of GWAS and gene-based association analysis with whole-genome resequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to map genes related to meat lightness and redness to a 6 .

[ABSTRACT] STR can potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within only a few tens of minutes of recording time , making it ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings . Simulations demonstrate that this approach can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations , and application in recordings of primate parasol ganglion cells validates the experimental feasibility . Here , we combine concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography and introduce super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ) as a technique to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits . It arises from the nonlinear transmission of signals that ganglion cells receive from bipolar cells , which thereby constitute functional subunits within a ganglion cell 's receptive field . This calls for efficient methods , which leave sufficient experimental time to leverage the acquired knowledge for further investigating identified subunits . Inferring these subunits from recorded ganglion cell activity promises a new avenue for studying the functional architecture of the retina . Spatially nonlinear stimulus integration by retinal ganglion cells lies at the heart of various computations performed by the retina .
[INTRODUCTION] While the LN model is still popular due to its simplicity , it has long been known that many ganglion cells respond strongly to spatially structured stimuli , even when there is no net-change in the average illumination of the receptive field [ 2-6 ] -a characteristic the LN model can not replicate . This can take the center-surround structure of their receptive fields into account , but indiscriminately considers luminance signals inside the receptive field to be integrated linearly and passed through a nonlinearity only afterwards , at the model 's output stage . To address this issue , we introduce a novel method to identify the layout of subunits composing a ganglion cell 's receptive field that makes use of stimuli specifically targeted towards the computational characteristics of subunits and that has the potential of considerably reducing the required recording time . For bipolar cells , progress has been made on large-scale recordings using glutamate imaging , but it is difficult to combine these techniques to obtain information about the connectivity between large populations of bipolar and ganglion cells . The method combines the functional principles underlying stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) microscopy and tomographic imaging such as computed tomography ( CT ) scans , and we accordingly term it super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ) . However , these approaches are often based on ganglion cell responses to fine spatiotemporal white noise stimuli , which generally evoke comparatively weak responses , making long recordings necessary . For retinal ganglion cells , extracellular recordings with multielectrode arrays allow large-scale functional characterizations that can
[RESULTS] Fig 4A shows that , in the range of roughly five to fifteen subunits , subunit detection was similarly effective with the default parameters ( blue line ) as with parameters optimized for each specific number of subunits ( red line ) , and only deviated strongly from the optimal performance for numbers of subunits that were considerably larger or smaller than our standard scenario of ten subunits . Comparing the response maps obtained with the simple homogeneous spot ( Fig 1C ) and with the Mexican-hat shaped spot ( Fig 1D
[DISCUSSION] For a complex cell that prefers edges of a particular orientation , for example , such a stimulus might be a localized , sharp black-white edge whose intensity profile rapidly falls off as one moves away from the black-white transition , or it might comprise an edge with sidebands of opposing contrast on both sides , analogous to the center-surround structure of the Ricker stripes . In theory , by identifying all subunit layouts , relating subunit properties to bipolar cell types and studying the transmission strength of each bipolar to ganglion cell type by targeted stimuli , a fairly complete functional connectome of this part of the retina might be in reach , at least as far as connections with sufficiently nonlinear transmission are concerned . We believe the same effect to apply in our tomographic approach with super-resolution stimuli for subunit identification , as Ricker stripes constitute a much more potent stimulus for driving ganglion cells than small spots with suppressive rings or spatiotemporal white noise at the required high spatial resolution ( Fig 4 ) . Nevertheless , in future applications , a general line of thought to follow when deciding on the parameters of the Ricker stripes would be to choose their width w to be similar to or slightly smaller than the expected diameter of subunits and increase the sideband strength s as much as the evoked responses permit to sharpen the contributions of
[METHODS] Following a dark-adaptation period of several hours , during which retinal pieces for other experiments were prepared , a piece of peripheral retina was excised , isolated from the pigment epithelium and placed on a multielectrode array ( MultiChannel Systems , Reutlingen , Germany ) with 252 electrodes spaced 60 μm apart and sized 10 μm , which had been coated with poly-D-lysine .

[ABSTRACT] sgRNA efficiency interacts in a non-linear way with drug sensitivity , producing an effect where the concentration-dependence is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength ( and less so for sgRNAs that induce too much or too little target depletion ) . However , for noisier datasets , some of these methods generate far more significant interactions , likely including many false positives , whereas CRISPRi-DR maintains higher precision , which we observed in both empirical and simulated data . To capture this interaction , we propose a novel statistical method called CRISPRi-DR ( for Dose-Response model ) that incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation . This approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets , which we show via an CRISPRi dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources . The objective is to identify CRISPRi mutants whose relative abundance is suppressed ( or enriched ) in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted , reflecting synergistic behavior . We use CRISPRi-DR to re-analyze data from a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify genes that interact with antibiotics . Discovery of genes that interact with exposure to antibiotics can yield insights to drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance . Different sgRNAs for a given target can induce a wide range of protein depletion and differential effects on growth rate . We observe that the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs . For essential genes , sgRNA efficiency can be empirically measured by quantifying effects on growth rate . An important application of CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) technology is for identifying chemical-genetic interactions ( CGIs ) . However , the actual growth phenotype depends on the sensitivity of cells to depletion of the target protein . The effect of sgRNA strength can be partially predicted based on sequence features . The performance is competitive with the best of several related analytical methods .
[INTRODUCTION] Among all the existing CRISPR analytical methods , MAGeCK-MLE is the only other method that explicitly includes sgRNA efficiencies as an input , which are used to set the prior probabilities that each sgRNA is effective or not ( because of their focus on CRISPRko ) in the joint probability formula , to initialize for the Expectation Maximization iterations . One , called MAGeCK ( originally intended for CRISPRko screens ) , calculates a log-fold-change ( of mean counts ) for each sgRNA between a treatment condition and a reference condition ( control ) , and uses a Gaussian distribution to estimate the significance of differences in mean sgRNA abundance between treatments and controls ( based on the implementation in the source code , which differs from the description in the publication ) . While exposure to an inhibitory compound will challenge the growth of all the mutants in a hypomorph library , mutants with depletion of a gene that interacts with a drug ( e. g. prototypically , an essential gene that is the drug target ) will exhibit excess depletion relative to others in the library due to the combined effect of both the growth-inhibition due to the drug treatment in conjunction with the growth-impairment due to knock-down of an vulnerable gene , making these hypomorphic mutants even more sensitive to the drug . First , CGI experiments are ideally carried out with multiple drug

[DISCUSSION] While CRISPRi libraries can be constructed with multiple sgRNAs per target , most CRISPR analytical methods do not explicitly handle such , and those that do ( such as MAGeCK-RRA and CRISPhieRmix ) are essentially designed to identify significant genes by focusing on a subset of apparently effective sgRNAs ( i. e. allowing for ineffective sgRNAs , which are filtered out for each target ) . Using the joint criterion for significance based on the empirical Bayes FDR analysis and the Wald test in CRISPRi-DR partially helps to mitigate this , producing a more focused list of candidate interactions and eliminating genes with small random slopes of concentration dependence that are not likely to be genuine interactions ( i. e. false positives ) . For example , in re-analysis of data from the Mathis , Otto and Reynolds paper , we showed the same equation could be adapted for modeling the effect of E. coli cultures grown on medium with different carbon sources ; the time parameter could be substituted for the concentration , since depletion of essential genes caused a gradual killing with an S-curve shape over time . MAGeCK-MLE is the only other analytical method that take sgRNA efficiencies as an input ; in that method , the empirical measures of

[ABSTRACT] Using RNAseq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster , we show that ( a ) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods , that ( b ) several of those gene groups are not modular , and that ( c ) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities . These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks . For this , we use a recently developed community detection method , the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model ( SBM ) , that does not assume that assortative modules exist . While it is reasonable to expect that these modules exist , using methods that assume they exist a priori is risky , as it guarantees that alternative organizations of gene interactions will be ignored . Most community detection algorithms expect genes to be organized into assortative modules , that is , groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups . Instead , the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes . Here , we ask : can we find meaningful communities without imposing a modular organization on gene co-expression networks , and how modular are these communities ? Finding communities in gene co-expression networks is a common first step toward extracting biological insight from these complex datasets .
[INTRODUCTION] Given that other biological networks , like neuronal networks , exhibit clear evidence for these alternative organizations , there is no reason to think that a system as complex and as high-dimensional as the transcriptome should be limited to a single pattern of organization . Weighted gene co-expression network analysis [ WGCNA , 3 ] uses a power transformation of the correlation between gene expression ( or a topological similarity measure built with these transformed correlations ) as a similarity measure that is then separated into assortative modules using hierarchical clustering . Although these methods differ in their definition of similarity , they all impose an assortative structure on the gene expression network , in which similar genes are expected to be more correlated with each other than with other genes . To explicitly address this possibility of alternative organizations , we use a more general measure of similarity that allows us to find meaningful gene groups that are not necessarily assortative but still have clear biological interpretation . provides several examples of network organization besides assortativity , like non-assortative networks , in which vertices have more edges to vertices between communities than within ; or core-periphery , in which a central community is connected to other communities , but the peripheral communities are not internally connected ( Fig 1 ) . We currently lack the empirical information on how common these patterns are in gene co-expression data , simply because our widely applied methods are completely blind to them due to their exclusive focus on assortativity . This drastically reduces the number of genes we need to consider
[RESULTS] Examining lower levels of the hierarchy , we see that often the daughter blocks at Level-2 are also enriched with generally similar terms , as expected , but these tend to become more specific as we go down the hierarchy . Because the SBM does not use modularity maximization to find communities , we were able to use the resulting clustering to measure , in an unbiased manner , the assortativity of individual blocks and the overall degree of modularity of the transcriptional networks in the head and the body . The SBM
[DISCUSSION] More studies using methods that do n't rely on modularity maximization will be needed to determine whether there are general patterns of non-modular organization . Here , we find that non-modular blocks are widespread in gene co-expression networks , and that the evidence for their functional relevance is as strong as for modular blocks . This highlights the need to incorporate other sources of information , beyond assortativity , when exploring biological networks .
[METHODS] Alternative thresholds could have been chosen , potentially leading to different downstream results , and to assess the effects of the FDR choice , we performed a sequence of SBM fits with a random subset of around 200 genes , showing that the main results should be robust to wide range of FDR choices ( S1 Fig ) .

[ABSTRACT] Defects in translation initiation and the stabilization of specific classes of mRNAs in pab1Δ cells appear to be partly indirect consequences of reduced levels of specific initiation factors , decapping activators , and components of the deadenylation complex in addition to the general loss of Pab1 's direct role in these processes . To understand both the direct and indirect roles of PABPC in more detail , we have employed mass spectrometry to assess the abundance of the components of the yeast proteome , as well as RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq to analyze changes in the abundance and translation of the yeast transcriptome , in cells lacking the PAB1 gene . Cytoplasmic poly ( A ) -binding protein ( PABPC ; Pab1 in yeast ) is thought to be involved in multiple steps of post-transcriptional control , including translation initiation , translation termination , and mRNA decay . Collectively , our results indicate that , unlike the loss of simpler regulatory proteins , elimination of cellular Pab1 is profoundly pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcriptional regulation . We find that pab1Δ cells manifest drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome , as well as defects in translation initiation and termination . Cells devoid of Pab1 also manifested a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination .
[INTRODUCTION] PABPC 's conserved structure consists of three regions : i ) four RNA recognition motif ( RRM ) domains , two of which ( RRM1 and RRM2 ) bind 12 adenosines with high affinity , while the protein overall covers 27 adenosines , ii ) a proline-rich ( P ) linker domain , and iii ) a C-terminal mademoiselle ( MLLE ) domain that interacts with other proteins via their PABP-interacting motif 2 ( PAM2 ) . Direct evidence for PABPC 's ability to enhance termination includes : i ) addition of PABPC1 to an in vitro termination assay improved termination efficiency , ii ) PABP-interacting protein PAIP1 and PAIP2 competed with eRF3 for free PABPC binding , reducing termination efficiency of PTCs in vitro , and iii ) deletion of PAB1 or Pab1 's P-C domains in vivo increased stop codon readthrough efficiency of reporter PTCs in a proximity-dependent manner . Importantly , mRNAs with longer poly ( A ) tails are generally more stable and better translated than their short-tailed or un-tailed counterparts [ 3 , 15-23 ] , observations that led us to propose a role for PABPC in the enhancement of translation initiation by the possible formation of an mRNA `` closed-loop '' [ 23-25 ] . The role of PABPC in termination is also inferred from : i ) the observation that tethering PABPC1 or Pab1 downstream of premature termination codons ( PTCs ) antagonized nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) , an mRNA decay pathway thought to be activated by the reduced termination
[RESULTS] Because PABPC plays major roles in the regulation of mRNA decay and translation , the termination defect and increased readthrough observed in pab1Δpbp1Δ cells can be due to : i ) loss of Pab1 's direct function in termination via its interaction with eRF3 or ii ) changes in the stability of release factor mRNAs or changes in their translation that result in depletion of the respective proteins , which in turn affect global termination efficiency . To determine whether the reduction in eIF4G level can be ruled out as
[DISCUSSION] However , Pab1 's direct role in termination is still implied because i ) 3'-UTR length , which approximates the distance of Pab1 to the stop codon , lost its ability to predict readthrough efficiency in pab1Δ cells as opposed to WT ( Fig 8B ) or eRF1 mutant cells ( i. e. , 3'-UTR length should have still been predictive of readthrough efficiency if increased readthrough was a consequence of release factor depletion alone ) , and ii ) deletion of Pab1 's eRF3 interacting domain only ( pab1ΔC ) , which affects termination but not mRNA decay , yields significant stop codon readthrough of reporter mRNAs . Even when we focused our analyses on mRNAs that did have significant changes in TE , where their drastic changes may be due to specific factors outside of the global regulators of translation initiation , their properties are still related to eIF4G-dependent pre-initiation complex recruitment , eIF1-mediated start codon recognition , and efficiency of ribosome recycling ( Figs 5-7 ) . It is also possible that the role of Pab1 in initiation is masked by the strain background used in our study , where yeast cells may have already altered their gene expression profiles to compensate for the lack of Pab1 over extended period of time upon full gene deletion and reached a steady state , because more widespread TE changes ( ~2 .

[ABSTRACT] We use bifurcation analysis of the complete system as well as the slow-fast method to reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation-a common feature of class I excitable neurons . The identified minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump 's generic contribution to burst dynamics can , therefore , contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and , potentially , inform therapeutic strategies . We suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation , such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na+/K+-ATPase activity . Slow brain rhythms , for example during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization , can be accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration . Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase , bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing the bifurcation structure , spiking is tonic , or cells are silenced via depolarization block . It is based on the interplay of fast-spiking voltage dynamics with a one-dimensional slow dynamics of the extracellular potassium concentration , mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase . They are assumed to arise from network-level mechanisms , involving synaptic interactions and delays , or from intrinsically bursting neurons . Here , we explore an alternative mechanism generically available to all neurons with class I excitability . Such slow brain rhythms typically have a lower frequency than tonic action-potential firing . Neuronal burst generation is commonly attributed to ion channels with slow kinetics .
[INTRODUCTION] For the proposed mechanism two facts are combined : ( 1 ) All neuron models that can produce arbitrarily slow firing rates ( class I excitable neurons ) share the necessary fundamental bifurcation structure and can be tuned into a bistable regime ( where a stable fixed point and a limit-cycle co-exist ) [ 23-25 ] . Theoretical and experimental research suggests that the neuron 's ability to generate bursts of activity intrinsically arises from the expression of specific ion channels , such as hyperpolarization-activated inward transient potassium channels or calcium-dependent channels [ 2 , 12-14 ] . Finally , the conditions for which the model can be tuned into the slow bursting regime or other dynamics such as depolarization block and tonic spiking are discussed by analysis of the bifurcations in the complete system . Along these lines , brain regions that exhibit large-scale oscillatory behaviour often contain significant numbers of single-neuron bursters [ 9-11 ] , fostering network entrainment via pacemaker neurons . Such oscillatory activity is associated with physiological states , ranging from normal breathing to the consolidation of memories , or pathological situations such as epileptic seizures and spreading depolarization ( SD ) [ 1-5 ] . We argue that via this mechanism , in principle , any class I nerve cell can be switched into an intrinsic burster even in the absence of channels with slow dynamics . First , a neuron 's embedding in the network can produce bursts via reverberating activity , with synaptic
[RESULTS] see next sections ) , a neuron model equipped with only basic fast spike-generating ion channels is placed in an external environment of fixed volume that contains extracellular potassium ions , whose concentration , [ K+ ] out , can change ( Fig 1 ) . Thereby , the resting state loses stability and the system converges back onto the tonic spiking dynamics ( dark grey ) , where the next burst cycle is initiated ; for a zoom out of the bifurcation diagram in Fig 3B
[DISCUSSION] It is important to note , firstly , that this bistability is different from the bistability in the fast subsystem that the burst mechanism relies on , and secondly , that the free energy depleted depolarisation block , a property of the whole system , is not the same as the Hopf curve in our fast bifurcation diagram , which also terminates spiking . While other , more complex models , exhibit deterministic bursting too , the mechanism described in this study relies only on a minimal set of physiological assumptions in neurons and its dynamics agree with experimental observations in pathological states like epilepsy or spreading depolarization . Kager and colleagues indicated that [ K+ ] out or voltage-dependent ion channels that elicit inward currents can generate seizure-like rhythmic activity , provided that the inward current secondarily triggers the release of K+ into a confined extracellular space-a set of conditions met by the Na+/K+-ATPase . Note that in the bistable region between the HOM and SN bifurcations , the presence of noise in the system or its input can result in stochastic bursting that emerges from switching between the stable limit cycle attractor and the fixed-point dynamics ( see , for example ) . Depending on Na+/K+-ATPase density and input strength , the complete concentration-dependent system exhibits four different regimes : rest , tonic spiking
[METHODS] Therefore , for each desirable [ K+ ] out , we can average the terms that relate to the fast subsystem ( IP and IK in Eq 9 ) over one full action potential limit cycle , as shown below : d [ K+ ] outdt=AcellFVexτ∫0τ ( IK−2Ip ) fastdt , ( 14 ) where τ is the period of the fast",,958,96,None,"In the brain , slow brain rhythms can be accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration .

[ABSTRACT] Therefore , it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria , from cluster stability to prognostic relevance , and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets . Affinity Network Fusion , Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization , and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies . Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types , including breast , prostate , and lung , utilizing mRNA , CNV , miRNA , and DNA methylation data . Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like clustering stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance . Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score , survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates , and the stability of the results . Unlike previous studies , our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness . Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation , we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study . Furthermore , current frameworks do not allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering , highlighting a significant gap in the methodology . COPS features advanced methods , including similarity networks , kernel-based approaches , dimensionality reduction , and pathway knowledge integration . We present the COPS R-package , tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results . Some of these methods are not accessible through R , and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS . While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics , they vary considerably across methods and datasets .
[INTRODUCTION] Moreover , current benchmarking studies do not provide a computational platform for testing and comparing multi-view clustering methods on novel datasets , allowing for the selection of the best clustering methods based on stability and other relevant metrics , nor do they permit access to both existing and novel pathway-based methods , thereby highlighting a significant gap in the methodology . While previous research has used metrics like ARI or F1-score to assess clustering accuracy , and survival analysis with the log-rank tests between clusters or proportional-hazards regression models using latent variables to assess the prognostic significance of cancer subtypes , they often overlooked critical factors . Here , we present COPS ( Clustering algorithms for Omics-driven Patient Stratification and robust evaluation of clustering results ) an R package that provides quick access to a unique compendium of state-of-the-art clustering methods for single- and multi-omic data as well as a robust pipeline to evaluate the reproducibility and prognostic value of clustering results in addition to standard clustering metrics . Within multi-omics methods , the most promising are so called intermediate integration methods which aim to analyze multi-view data in a holistic manner rather than analyzing each view separately or concatenating all features before applying machine learning . It uses the Pareto optimal criterion to find all clustering solutions that optimally balance different metrics , highlighting solutions where ( by selecting a different method or number of clusters ) no one objective can be
[RESULTS] For instance , the thyroid selected subtype was based on two mutually exclusive driver mutations with highly impactful signaling pathway effects that were recovered quite well with the most reliable methods in our tests while the breast and ovarian cancer subtypes were based on mRNA expression clustering into five and four clusters with biological relevance [ 25 , 30-32 ] , which makes them more difficult to reproduce exactly even when using gene-expression data alone . To evaluate the performance of different clustering algorithms
[DISCUSSION] We focused on kernel-based knowledge driven clustering methods due to their performance advantage in analyzing high-dimensional data and the ability to separate the kernel from the algorithm which enabled us to compare the same clustering algorithm between data- and knowledge-driven kernels and to use PIK which was originally developed for a supervised learning task . The stability analysis highlighted that many algorithms , such as ANF , IntNMF , and MKKM-MR with linear kernels , BWK , or PIK , were effective in identifying stable clusters while iCluster+ , MOFA2 , and MKKM-MR with RWR-BWK or PAMOGK were less stable , which suggests an elevated sensitivity to sampling variability . For this reason , we selected a cancer-associated subset of 48 KEGG pathways for the main figures , but also tested the NCI-PID pathways of which 210 included overlapping genes with the TCGA datasets ( See S4 , S5 , and S7 Figs ) . Out of the pathway based methods BWK and PIK seemed most promising , however , it should be noted that combining these methods with different pathway interaction databases such as Reactome or the National Cancer Institute Pathway interaction database , could yield different results . As the full interplay between different omics in the pathogenesis of cancer is still not fully understood , it
[METHODS] In addition to readily available methods , we implemented several emerging methods which were not accessible through official R-packages such as 1 ) community detection on k-nearest-neighbour graphs ; 2 ) two multi-view kernel methods including Multiple Kernel K-Means with Matrix induced Regularization , and Multi-view Clustering with Enhanced Consensus ; 3 ) pathway based kernels from ; 4 )",,986,98,None,"Multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like cluster stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance , and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets .

Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types , including breast , prostate , or lung . We applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study . Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation , our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view Clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness . In addition , current frameworks do not allow for comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering , highlighting a significant gap in the methodology ."

[ABSTRACT] Furthermore , our work identified new interactions in the gene regulatory network ( GRN ) underlying C. elegans postembryonic development and adds to the general understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins . We have identified a novel partial loss-of-function sem-2 allele that has a proline to serine change in the C-terminal tail of the highly conserved DNA-binding domain . Finally , SEM-2 appears to directly regulate the expression of hlh-8 , which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor and plays critical roles in proper patterning of the M lineage . First , SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381 , the sole C. elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor , to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage . One set of highly conserved transcription factors that plays diverse roles in development is the SoxC group . Our data , along with previous studies , suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins . SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development , and for specifying the sex myoblast ( SM ) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm , the M lineage . Detailed analyses of mutant animals harboring this point mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage . Second , in addition to specifying the SM fate , SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage . Development of multicellular organisms requires well-orchestrated interplay between cell-intrinsic transcription factors and cell-cell signaling . C. elegans contains a sole SoxC protein , SEM-2 .
[INTRODUCTION] During hermaphrodite postembryonic development , the M mesoblast cell undergoes stereotypical divisions to produce fourteen striated body wall muscles ( BWMs ) , two non-muscle coelomocytes ( CCs ) , and two multipotent sex myoblasts ( SMs ) that subsequently proliferate to produce sixteen sex muscles-four type I and four type II vulval muscles ( vm1s and vm2s ) , as well as four type I and four type II uterine muscles ( um1s and um2s ) -that are required for egg laying ( Fig 1A-1B ) . Our work uncovered new interactions in the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembryonic development , some of which are likely conserved in other species , and we add to the general understanding of the functions and structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins . In particular , LIN-12/Notch signaling is known to function upstream of the single C. elegans SoxC protein , SEM-2 , to specify the SM fate in the ventral M lineage , while the zinc finger transcription factor SMA-9 antagonizes BMP signaling to specify the M lineage-derived CC ( M-CC for short ) fate in the dorsal side [ 3-6 ] . By analyzing the M lineage phenotypes of jj152 mutants , we uncovered an unexpected role of SEM-2 in the dorsal M lineage , where SEM-2 functions antagonistically at the level of expression and function with LET-381 in CC specification . HLH-8 is a basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factor that is expressed in the undifferentiated cells of the M lineage through
[RESULTS] Several lines of evidence suggest that jj152 is an allele of sem-2 : 1 ) whole genome sequencing revealed that jj152 maps to chromosome I and contains a cytosine ( C ) to thymine ( T ) nucleotide change , which results in a proline ( P ) to serine ( S ) residue change in amino acid 158 ( P158S ) of SEM-2 ( Fig 2A-2B ) ; 2 ) jj152 failed to complement the sem-2 null allele in both the Egl and the Susm phenotypes (
[DISCUSSION] The more prevalent expression of the vm1-specific reporter ( egl-15p : :rfp ) in sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants is similar to our previous report showing that in lin-39 ( 0 ) mab-5 ( 0 ) mutants where the M lineage exhibits reduced cell proliferation , the few M lineage cells precociously differentiate to express the vm1 marker egl-15p : :gfp , but not vm2 or um markers . We have shown that while the vm1-specific reporter ( egl-15p : :rfp ) is expressed in over 90 % of sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants , a significantly smaller fraction of sem-2 ( P158S ) mutant animals express the vm2-specific reporter ( hlh-29p : :gfp , 28 % ) , the um-specific marker ( rgs-2p : :gfp , 50 % ) , or another vm marker ( arg-1p : :gfp , 1 . Based on this model , in wild-type animals , SMA-9 functions , either acting through or independently of LET-381 , to repress sem-2 expression in the presumptive CC mothers ( M. dlp and M. drp ) and CCs ( M. dlpa and M. drpa ) in the dorsal M lineage ( Fig 11A ) . In sem-2 ( P158S ) ; sma-9 ( 0 ) double mutants , the partially functional SEM-2 ( P158S ) protein being expressed in the dorsal side of the M lineage
