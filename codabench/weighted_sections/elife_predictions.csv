[ABSTRACT] Thus , our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one , but multiple gap junctions , in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions . We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells , at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse . The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses . Remarkably , most of the synaptic contact 's surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions , suggesting a close functional association between these two structures . In contrast , glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact , indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse . Electrical synapses are , on the other hand , generally defined by the presence of a 'gap junction ' ( a cluster of intercellular channels ) between two neuronal processes . Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures . However , while gap junctions provide the communicating mechanism , it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures . Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell-cell communication , known as 'chemical ' and 'electrical ' synapses , respectively . Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components . Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components .
[INTRODUCTION] While GJs are ubiquitous and present in virtually every tissue of the organism providing metabolic coupling , they additionally serve as a pathway of low resistance for the spread of electrical currents between neurons ( and cells of the heart ) , the main form of signaling in the brain , which is fast enough to operate within the time frame required for decision-making by neural circuits . Expansion revealed the presence of multiple well-defined puncta distributed throughout the contact area , which , consistent with the notion that they represent GJ plaques , each exhibited labeling for the fish homologs of the widespread mammalian connexin 36 ( Cx36 ) , Cx35 , and Cx34 , as well as for the GJ scaffolding protein zonula occludens ( ZO1 ) . This is the case for auditory afferents terminating as single 'large myelinated club endings ' or 'club endings ' ( CEs ) on the lateral dendrite of the teleost Mauthner cells ( a pair of large reticulospinal neurons involved in tail-flip escape responses in fish ) , each containing GJs and specializations for chemical transmission . Finally , double labeling with Cx and glutamate receptor antibodies showed that , while GJs are distributed throughout the entire contact area , a much smaller number of glutamatergic sites are restricted to the periphery occupying a small fraction ( ~19 % ) of the contact 's surface . Strikingly , expansion following staining with N-cadherin and ß-catenin antibodies , protein components of 'adherens junctions ' ( AJs ) , showed that these proteins are also distributed all throughout the contact area , but in a fashion that is mutually exclusive with connexin . Thus , our data suggest that synaptic communication at electrical synapses results from not one but the coordinated action of multiple GJs of variable size , which may require the functional contribution of additional structures , such as AJs . CEs from larval zebrafish share comparable morphological and functional properties with those of adult fish , and due to their genetic accessibility , allow for the opportunity to investigate the functional link between the structures enabling electrical transmission and
[RESULTS] We combined this approach with a protein-retention expansion microscopy protocol to explore not only the presence but the relative distribution of the structures formed by various synaptic proteins throughout the contact areas of CEs in 5 days post fertilization ( dpf ) zebrafish . The difference between expanded and non-expanded S/L ratios might also result from an underestimation of the small diameter due to a minor tilting along the long diameter in 'en face ' views of expanded CEs , which are more difficult to obtain because of their larger size . The synaptic contact areas of CEs ( Figure 1A ) can be visualized and unambiguously identified by immunolabeling for these

These neurons are known as Mauthner cells , which are found on the lateral dendrite of the teleost cells of the mammalian brain .

[ABSTRACT] We show that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons , based on their axonal projections , is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors . To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons , we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity , with minimal effects on breathing . The pre-Bötzinger complex ( preBötC ) , a key primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm , contains neurons that project directly to facial nucleus ( 7n ) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity . The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity . This is of fundamental importance , given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases . These effects are altered by the type of anesthetic employed and also between anesthetized and conscious states .
[INTRODUCTION] Although several studies have attempted to understand the physiological function/s of each preBötC neuronal subpopulation , disturbances in breathing , that occur when preBötC neurons are either inhibited or activated , impact our understanding of whether the observed changes are due to the direct effects of preBötC neurons or alterations resulting from changes in the respiratory rhythm and blood gases . To further understand the organization of the preBötC , in this study , we have tested the hypothesis that the preBötC region is composed of segregated subgroups of output neurons , potentially driven by a separate group of rhythmogenic neurons , that modulate specific behaviors , such as orofacial muscle activity . Strict coordination of breathing with the activity of facial and upper airway muscles underlies the rhythmic orofacial behaviors , such as sniffing , sucking , licking , whisking , vocalization , and swallowing , which are fundamental for ingestive and exploratory behavior , and social interaction . Understanding and identifying the preBötC subgroups that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors is of fundamental importance , given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors has been associated with the development and progression of diseases . Furthermore , whilst substantial gains have been made in understanding the expression of selective molecular markers in subgroups of preBötC neurons , it is rarely possible to reliably assign particular neurochemical signatures to unique functions . Photoinhibition of preBötC neurons produces the expected apnea , but also causes a significant reduction of sympathetic vasomotor activity , reduces respiratory modulation of BP , and increases cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity to decrease HR and respiratory-sinus arrhythmia . Similarly , coordination of this motor activity with autonomic nervous system activity produces phasic fluctuations of blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate ( HR ) that are essential for optimizing cardiac efficiency and organ blood flow . Breathing is a complex behavior requiring the coordination of multiple motor patterns in the face , upper airways , thorax , and abdomen to enable gas exchange between the external and internal environment and maintenance of blood gas homeostasis . To test this hypothesis , we utilized a combinatorial viral transgenic approach with one virus providing cre-recombinase ( Cre ) -dependent expression of an optically activated chloride channel , GtACR2 , and another retrograde axonal
[RESULTS] To evaluate whether distinct subgroups of preBötC neurons could be distinguished based on their axonal projections , retrograde adeno-associated viruses ( AAVrg ) , expressing either green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) , or the red fluorophore , mCherry , were injected into 7n and the rostral ventrolateral medulla ( RVLM ) ( n=3 ) , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . To modulate the activity of selectively transduced neurons , we generated an adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) which enabled Cre-dependent ( DIO ) expression , under the control of the ubiquitous chicken β-actin/cytomegalovirus ( CAG ) promoter , of the light-activated chloride channel , GtACR2 , fused to a portion of Kv2 . As suggested by our initial retrograde labeling
[DISCUSSION] Although we have contemplated directing the optical fibers to the facial nucleus to evaluate this , we are cautious about using GtACR2 to inhibit axonal terminals , given the evidence of increased synaptic activity and neurotransmitter release in response to light-induced activation of GtACR2 at the axon terminal . It is possible that the strict synchronization between premotor and motor neurons is not confined to respiratory motor activity , but is crucial for the coordination of respiratory , cardiovascular , and orofacial/nasofacial activity necessary for the execution of complex behaviors , such as exercise , response to stress , or pain . Interestingly , in addition to regulating expiratory activity , it has been shown that the lateral parafacial nucleus may also play a role in coordinating nasofacial and orofacial behavior during high chemical drive via direct projections to 7n . In this way , methodologies that only affect inputs from preBötC to C1 neurons , such as the
[METHODS] The rat was transferred to a recording cage , and the effects of preBötC photoinhibition on dEMG , ECG , and mystacial pad EMG were evaluated under three different states : when the animals were still under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia , during the very early stage of regaining consciousness , a few minutes after the anesthesia was reversed with atipamezole and",,949,96,None,"Breathing is a complex behavior that requires the coordination of multiple motor patterns in the face , upper airways , thorax , and abdomen . These motor patterns are regulated by a network of neurons called the pre-Bötzinger complex ( or preBöTC ) , which is responsible for breathing . The brainstem , or a region of the brain called the facial nucleus , controls the activity of the facial muscles , as well as the breathing rhythm . However , it is not clear how these neurons work together to control breathing , because it is unclear how they work together . To investigate this question , Weidman et al . used a technique called photoinhibition . This technique allowed us to identify the neurons that control breathing and to measure their activity . In the experiments , we were able to identify a group of neurons that were involved in breathing – a process known as the pre BötZinger Complex – that control the activity and rhythms of the face muscles . Using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches , the experiments showed that the preBotZINGER Complex was composed of two groups of neurons , each of which is involved in regulating the activity or nasofacial muscles in the brain . When the neurons were inhibited , they produced the expected apnea , but also caused a significant reduction in the sympathetic vasomotor activity , increasing the heart rate , decreasing the blood pressure ,"

[ABSTRACT] These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system , capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception , and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger . Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests , presumably by amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous . If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm , their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat . Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain . However , most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses , with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors . In contrast , animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses , even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning . To address this , we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice . Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes .
[INTRODUCTION] The ability to adaptively switch between passive and active defenses in response to varying threat contexts is essential for optimizing survival outcomes , as demonstrated by studies utilizing naturalistic threat stimuli like predator-like robots or looming disks , which allowed the observation of various critical defensive behaviors . However , for CGRP neurons to serve as a true general alarm system , they must be capable of transmitting threat-related signals and facilitating the coordination of appropriate defensive behaviors , whether passive or active . In this process , a neutral sensory stimulus ( conditioned stimulus or CS ) is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus ( US ) , leading to a conditioned response ( CR ) that can be expressed as either freezing or fleeing , depending on the specific features of the CS and US . Prior studies have primarily focused on the role of CGRP neurons in mediating passive freezing behavior , demonstrating that activation of these neurons exclusively elicits immediate freezing behavior and contributes to the formation of fear memories . These results highlight the role of CGRP neurons as a general alarm signal , primarily facilitating passive defensive behaviors , while also engaging in active defensive behaviors in response to high-threat conditions . To address this , we employed a more dynamic and ecologically relevant US by using a predator-like robot to chase the animals , thereby incorporating an imminent threat . A critical component of this adaptive response is the general alarm signal , which detects danger and plays a role in eliciting appropriate defensive behaviors in the face of threats . We first recorded CGRP neuron activity in response to various aversive stimuli including the robot chasing to determine whether they encode noxious stimuli differentially . While the role of CGRP neurons in passive responses is well-established , their potential involvement in active defensive behaviors remains unexplored . Our results suggest that manipulation of CGRP neurons bidirectionally modulates conditioned fleeing behaviors through altering the perception of the threat . Neurons within the PBN that express CGRP have been suggested to function as general alarm signals in the brain . Additionally , these CGRP neurons relay US information to the central amygdala during conventional fear conditioning with electric footshock . These neurons respond to
[RESULTS] The following day , the animals were placed in a donut-shaped maze and presented with the CS 10 times , each paired with an US of being chased by the robot at a speed of 70 cm/s for 3 s. When animals collided with the robot , it pushed them forward , increasing their fleeing speed ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1C ) . For inactivation , CGRP neurons were inhibited for 2 s , followed by a 1 s ramp down , repeated in cycles until a total duration of 30 s. Jaws and control groups showed no difference in movement during light on and off phases , indicating that light delivery did not alter their defensive behavior
[DISCUSSION] The expression of defensive behaviors varied depending on the type of US : under robot chasing conditions , increased CGRP activity made the robot seem as if it were moving faster , driving the animals to flee more during both conditioning and the retention test . Overall , our findings indicate that CGRP neurons act as a general alarm system , primarily orchestrating freezing responses but also contributing to active defensive behaviors by intensifying the perception of heightened threats , ensuring responses are adapted to the level of danger . These findings suggest that CGRP neurons detect and process threats , predominantly driving freezing behavior , while also enabling active responses under heightened danger to facilitate appropriate defensive behaviors aligned with the intensity of the threat . Although fear learning can occur through various pathways , our use of optogenetics and TetTox suggested that CGRP neurons contribute to both active and passive defensive behaviors
[METHODS] For conditioning trials , the CS alone period was the first 7 s from CS onset , while for the habituation and retention tests , it was 10 s. Vertical movements , such as jumping , were manually recorded by an experimenter blind to the group assignments , with 1 point added to the flight score for each",,966,97,None,"The nervous system is made up of neurons called calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) , which are found in the brains of animals . These neurons are responsible for detecting and responding to a variety of threats , including a threat that threatens humans . However , it is not clear how these neurons communicate with each other , and how they respond to varying levels of danger . In the brain , a signal called the general alarm signal ( CR ) is transmitted to the brain by a neuron called the parabrachial nucleus . The CR is triggered when a stimulus is threatening , or when the animal is chasing a predator-like robot . CRs are triggered by the presence of an imminent threat , such as a looming disk . When a robot is chased by the animal , the CR can be activated , but it is unclear how CR activation affects the ability of the animal to flee . To investigate this question , Wang et al . studied the activity of a group of neurons in a region of the brain called the Parabrachiol nucleum . This revealed that the reactivation of CR neurons in response to the aversive CS was associated with a decrease in flight responses , even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning . Furthermore , when the robotic robot was chasing the animals , they were able to evade the robot , increasing their fleeing speed . Wang "

[ABSTRACT] Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ∼30 , 000 UK Biobank participants , we test the hypothesis that obesity ( waist-to-hip ratio , WHR ) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics : isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ) , an index of free water , and intra-cellular volume fraction ( ICVF ) , an index of neurite density . These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity , whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation . To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein ( CRP ) , we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF ( rg = 0 . The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions , decreased glial density , and high mu opioid ( MOR ) and other neurotransmitter receptor density . We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems : a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF . Conversely , the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors . 112 , P < 9×10−4 ) as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF ( P < 0 . The relationship between obesity and human brain structure is incompletely understood . 36 ) and ICVF ( rg = 0 . 026 , P = 0 . 05 ) .
[INTRODUCTION] Results in this field were often contradictory : although studies tended to report lower gray matter volume in relation to obesity , some have also observed null or positive associations as described in a meta-analysis by García-García et al. , 2019 , who noted that the likely reasons for this were heterogeneities in brain and obesity metrics , a wide variation in sample size , and poor statistical methodology . In this model , diffusion is modelled as isotropic in free water , restricted within neurites , and hindered in the extracellular space resulting in three microstructural metrics : Intracellular Volume Fraction ( ICVF ) , which captures the volume fraction occupied by neurites ( axons and dendrites ) but not cell bodies ; Orientation Dispersion Index ( OD ) , which captures the spatial distribution of these processes ; and isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ) , which provides a measure of free water index . We hypothesized that obesity would be associated with diffusion-MRI measures of grey matter tissue microstructure at 180 cortical regions and 8 subcortical structures ( bilaterally ) produced using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging ( NODDI ) modelling of data from ∼30 , 000 participants in the UK Biobank MRI cohort . Recent meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies , including data from 5882 participants and a mega-analysis of 6 , 420 participants from the ENIGMA MDD working group , have also identified a consistent association of obesity with reductions in grey matter volume and cortical thickness in the medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal pole . Specifically , we tested each metric at each region for association with waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ) , and identified two anatomically and functionally distinct brain systems associated with obesity , using prior maps of gene expression , cellular composition and neurotransmitter receptor density to refine functional characterization of each obesity-associated system . Given previous findings of significant association between macroscopic differences in brain structure and visceral obesity , we elected to report associations with WHR in the main text and report complementary results for BMI as a measure of whole body obesity in the
[RESULTS] To investigate the basis for these associations of WHR with tissue water content ( measured by ISOVF ) and neurite density ( measured by ICVF ) , we used human brain gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas to identify the individual gene transcripts that were most strongly co-located with each map . Enrichment analysis of the genes weighted by their spatial co-location with ISOVF~WHR identified 15 biological processes that were significantly under-represented , and 1 class that was positively enriched , with FDR = 5 % to control for 29 , 687 biological processes and 11 , 110 molecular functions tested for enrichment . The prefrontal-temporal-striatal system where ISOVF was
[DISCUSSION] By relating obesity associated grey matter microstructure maps to gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas , we show that regions where WHR was more tightly linked to tissue water content had greater expression of pattern recognition receptors ( PRR ) and receptors for binding fatty acid derivatives , and reduced expression of genes associated with biological processes linked to interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) responses . Interestingly , this system was not co-located with any specific cell class but it was co-located with specific neurotransmitter receptor maps including H3 , Mu , CB1 , and A4B2 , meaning that regions showing the greatest positive scaling between neurite density and WHR showed relatively low expression of receptors linked to feeding , appetite , and energy expenditure .

The brain contains many different types of cells called neurons , which are called dendrites , and these cells are known as grey matter . However , it is not clear how these cells work together to make the brain , or how they interact with each other . In addition , the brain has a number of different structures , such as the axons and dendritic cells , that can be used to measure the volume of the brain’s tissue . One of these structures is called the isotropic volume fraction ( WHR ) . WHR is a measure of free water in the brain; it measures how much water the brain contains . It is also known as the intra-cellular volume fraction , because it is able to measure how much free water is in the cell , but it does not measure the density of the cells in the inner ear . This means that WHR can only be used for measuring how much the brain is made of . To test this hypothesis , Wei et al . used a technique called diffusion-weighted MRI ( NODDI ) to study the brains of 30 , 000 people from the UK Biobank . Using the technique , we found that the WHR was associated with differences in the size and density of neurons in the prefrontal and temporal regions , as well as with the size of the glial cells . These differences were due to differences in genes that are involved in the immune system , whereas differences in proteins in the medial temporal and striatal regions were linked to the loss of the mu opioid receptors .

[ABSTRACT] Examining disseminating tumour cells in over 12 , 000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours , we see a significant enrichment of EpCAM , CD24 and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens . We have previously identified both EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers that , alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin , identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines . In this study , we have observed single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens , and these are highly predictive of metastatic disease . This afforded the opportunity to investigate whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours . However , tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the tissue surrounding human tumour specimens , leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain . Through training an artificial neural network , these predict metastasis with high accuracy ( cross-validated accuracy of 87-89 % ) . Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental cancer models .
[INTRODUCTION] Staining for EpCAM and CD24 alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin in over 12 , 000 imaging fields from 74 human tumours , stratified on metastatic status , identifies cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the stromal region surrounding metastatic primary tumours . EMT must be followed by the reverse process of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ) to enable new tumour growth at secondary sites , and therefore retained plasticity manifested as ability to revert to an epithelial phenotype is an important feature of metastatic CSCs . We therefore reasoned that retention of one or both of these markers may identify an important population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated from the primary tumour in human tumour specimens , and are responsible for subsequent metastatic seeding . We have previously demonstrated that a CD44highEpCAMlow/- EMT population can be separated from the main CD44lowEpCAMhigh epithelial population in flow cytometric analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) cell lines and fresh tumour specimens . However , this process has not been observed in human tumours in the in vivo setting , leading to uncertainty over the relevance of these findings to human tumour metastasis . Both EpCAM and CD24 were individually associated with enhanced ability to undergo MET , and thus are markers of EMT CSCs exhibiting retained plasticity . Using an image-based machine learning approach , we show that the presence of these EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma is predictive of metastasis . In multiple types of carcinoma , cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to enable metastatic dissemination from the primary tumour . However , these studies were limited to characterising cells undergoing the earliest stages of EMT whilst still attached to the cohesive body of the primary tumour . Attempts have been made to use the retention of epithelial markers alongside acquisition of mesenchymal markers to identify cells undergoing EMT in human tumours . As cancer cells exiting the tumour downregulate epithelial markers whilst undergoing EMT , they become indistinguishable from the mesenchymal non-tumour cells surrounding the tumour . We identified retained cell surface expression of EpCAM and CD24 in a minority of cells that have undergone a full morphological EMT . Here , we characterise the combined role of EpCAM and CD24 in marking a population of disseminating tumour cells
[RESULTS] The retention of EpCAM expression in a sub-population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT raised the prospect that we may be able to identify these cells outside of the tumour body in human tumour specimens , as EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker that would not normally be found in the surrounding stromal region . Starting with the EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 immunofluorescence grey levels for each nucleated cell , we used a supervised machine learning approach to predict whether an imaging field comes from a metastatic or non-metastatic tumour ( Figure 3A ) . For these tumours , using a variation on the previous image segmentation protocol ( Figure 2-figure supplement 3A-D ) , the proportion of EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ and EpCAM+Vim+CD24-
[DISCUSSION] An important strength of our study has been the ability to look at the single cell level in an automated fashion across thousands of fields of view from human tumours , enabling us to observe and quantify human tumour cells disseminating into the surrounding tissue . We have shown that immunofluorescent antibody co-staining for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 can separate disseminating EMT CSCs from the stromal content of human tumours , a challenge which has confounded previous attempts to develop a predictive EMT signature . This comes at the cost of increased computing requirements and reduced ability to decode the learning process ( the so-called 'black box ' ) , but in our study the image-based approach proved essential to achieve high predictive accuracy . The lack of improvement in predictive accuracy when trained on a collection of 9000 images compared to 3500 suggests a limitation of the ANN , and a possible role for more sophisticated neural
[METHODS] For the blinded analysis of tumour cohort 2 using the ANN trained on tumour cohort 1 , the identity of the tumours was withheld by the pathologists at Barts Health NHS Trust and thus both the model and research team developing the model were blind to the clinical ground truth for the new imaging fields . The sections were then incubated",,950,96,None,"Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) are cells that are found in the tissue surrounding a tumour . These cells are known as epithelial cells , and they are responsible for the growth of the tumour , which is often referred to as metastatic disease . However , it is not known how these cells are able to disseminate from the tumour to other parts of the body . To do this , the cancer cells must undergo a process called mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( EMT ) . EMT is a stage in the process of reverting to a normal phenotype . This process is known as the ‘metastasis’ process . In the first stage , cancer cells are attached to the body of the tumor , but they are not able or unwilling to move out of the tissue . Therefore , if the tumour is metastatic , they will be unable to grow again . Using a computer model of human oral cancer , Gupta et al . have now used a technique called machine learning to identify the cells that have undergone EMT in human oral tumours . The experiments show that the cells in the stroma that surrounds the tumour are highly enriched , with the cells containing the cell surface expressing EpCAM , CD24 and Vimentin , as well as the cells surrounding the tumour being dissected . It is therefore possible that the cell containing EpCAM and CD24 can be identified by a combination of these three markers . Although the results of the experiments are not yet known , their findings suggest that these two markers may be useful in identifying cells that may be undergoing EMT and that they may also be involved in the formation of metastatic tumours in"

[ABSTRACT] These data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients . Interestingly , human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6 . Here , we use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a map of the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds . We find that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells , including resident Lyve1+ macrophages , during inflammation . During early inflammation in mouse wounds , we detect upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms . However , the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood . Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis . Apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that drive tissue repair . By contrast , inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor , Timd4 , in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair .
[INTRODUCTION] Apoptotic cell death is characterized by cytomorphological alterations , DNA fragmentation , activation of caspases and other regulators , and finally membrane alterations including outer membrane exposure of phosphatidylserine ( PtdSer ) , which allows the recognition of apoptotic cells by cellular receptors on phagocytes . To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which apoptosis regulates skin wound healing , we performed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on cells from murine wound beds 24 hr and 48 hr after injury . Proper initiation and subsequent resolution of inflammation is essential for tissue repair and progression to the proliferation stage of healing , when fibroblasts , blood vessels , and other tissue-specific cells proliferate and migrate , forming new tissue to repair the wound . The most well-studied receptors that allow phagocytes to bind and phagocytose apoptotic cells include the TAM ( Tyro3 , Axl , and Mertk ) tyrosine kinases and the TIM ( T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain ) family of receptors . Cell death is a common event during tissue injury , and several studies from hydra to mice have shown the importance of apoptosis in the initiation of inflammation to drive reparative processes . As inflammation regresses , the proliferative phase leads to the coordination of epidermal keratinocytes , fibroblasts , endothelial , and immune cells to reseal the epidermal barrier and generate a reparative scar including new ECM production and revascularization . The results provide an atlas of cellular dynamics during the early stages of wound healing and reveal the essential role of the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells in driving tissue repair after injury . While several signaling factors have been shown to induce apoptosis in wounds , the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells are recognized and regulate tissue repair are not well understood . Repair of mammalian tissues requires highly dynamic changes in cellular heterogeneity and communication to correctly heal tissue , usually resulting in a scar rather than true tissue regeneration . Apoptosis occurs after skin injury , and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells - or efferocytosis - by macrophages reduces inflammatory signaling and repair in several tissues . While TIM receptors can directly bind PtdSer , TAM receptors require their ligands growth-arrest-specific 6 ( Gas6 ) and protein S ( Pros1 ) to bind to PtdSer . We found that
[RESULTS] We observed that Lyve1 was expressed at the protein level both in wound beds ( Figure 2C ) and adjacent to the wound ( Figure 2-figure supplement 1A ) with immunofluorescence staining , and confirmed that these cells were resident rather than recruited to the wound bed after injury , since they did not express GFP . To examine whether Axl signaling was required for wound repair , we intraperitoneally injected mice 3 hr prior to injury with either a control IgG Ab or anti-Axl function blocking Ab , which binds to Axl 's extracellular domain and blocks Axl-mediated viral infection , and has been shown to inhibit Axl activity in vitro . By training a neural network to identify cell types
[DISCUSSION] These data resonate with recent data suggesting that fibroblasts can engulf apoptotic endothelial cells to alter their contractility , migration , and ECM production , and may indicate a direct role for fibroblasts in modulating the inflammatory milieu of early wounds through detection of apoptotic cells . Here , we show that in early murine skin wounds , Axl inhibition did not impact efferocytosis in a detectable manner , but rather Axl expression shifted from dendritic cells to macrophages , suggesting possible compensatory mechanisms via other efferocytosis receptors . We found that apoptotic genes were upregulated in most of the cell types present in early wounds , which likely allows the dynamic shifts in transcriptional profiles of inflammatory cells we observed in the first few days of tissue repair . Given the importance of apoptosis in wound repair and the expression of distinct apoptotic receptors in different cells , skin wound healing is an excellent model to decipher
[METHODS] The percentage of the wound bed covered by ITGA6 staining ( re-epithelialization ) and CTF for Axl ( in a 1 mm square around the injection site ) or aSMA ( in the wound bed ) were calculated using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) as described previously . Wound beds were",,958,96,None,"In the skin , cells called apoptosis are formed when a cell dies . This process is called efferocytosis , and it is thought that this process is responsible for the formation of new tissue . However , it is not clear how e-fferocytic cells are recognized and cleared by phagocytes , which are involved in the repair of wounds and other tissues . To understand the mechanisms by which epoxides are cleared , Weidman et al . used a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to study the cellular dynamics of a mouse foot wound . The experiments show that a number of different cellular receptors are activated in the wound , including a receptor called Axl . These receptors have been shown to be important for wound healing , but they are not well understood . Weinberg , Yong ed . , has now used this technique to study a group of cells in the skin of mice that are affected by a type of skin injury called diabetic foot . Mice that have been treated with an anti-inflammatory drug , such as ibuprofen , were shown to have increased levels of Axal in their cells . In contrast , mice that had not been treated for diabetes showed a decrease in the levels of the receptor Axr . Further experiments showed that , in mice , the receptors that are present in the fibroblasts of the foot wound were activated , while in humans , they were not . Furthermore , we found that the axl receptors in the dendritic cells of the feet were also activated during inflammation . Therefore , these findings suggest that e"

[ABSTRACT] This method , called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ) , involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing , labeling a cell population of interest . By creating many such independently barcoded fly strains , TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects , identification of multiplet droplets , and barcoding of experimental timepoints , conditions , and replicates . Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided novel insights into the dynamics of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues and have enabled the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases . Thus , TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments . However , linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge . Furthermore , we demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements . We describe a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools in Drosophila to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations .
[INTRODUCTION] This method , called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ) , involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the poly-adenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during droplet-based single-cell sequencing , labeling a cell population of interest . Single-cell sequencing technologies have provided insights into the dynamics of gene expression throughout development , been used to characterize somatic variation and heterogeneity within tissues , and are currently enabling the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases . In multicellular animals , techniques such as GESTALT have enabled lineage tracing by using CRISPR to create unique barcodes in differentiating tissue , and barcode sequencing has also been employed to map connectivity in the brain . Spatial and temporal expression patterns , which can be used to distinguish between cell types and provide insight into cellular function , also provide a means to understand the organization and physiology of complex tissues such as the brain . In addition to descriptive cell atlas projects , studies involving multiple experimental timepoints throughout development and aging , or studies assessing the effects of experimental exposures or genetic manipulations would benefit from increased ability to multiplex samples . Thus , TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) -based behavioral or other fractionation screens analogous to BAR-Seq or Tn-Seq approaches employed in microbial organisms . Flies carrying TaG-EM barcodes can be exposed to different experimental perturbations and then tested in assays where flies , larvae , or embryos are fractionated based on behavioral outcomes or other phenotypes . Several of the emerging commercial spatial genomics technologies rely on in situ sequencing of marker genes allowing droplet-based single-cell transcriptomic data to be mapped onto a tissue . Outside of descriptive studies , these costs are also a barrier to including replicates to assess biological variability ; consequently , a lack of biological replicates derived from independent samples is a common shortcoming of single-cell sequencing experiments . The cellular identities of gene expression clusters identified in cell atlas data sets are typically inferred from the expression of distinctive gene sets , and the lack of positive identification of gene expression clusters introduces an element of uncertainty in this analysis . Thus , robust and scalable tools for measuring spatial and temporal
[RESULTS] While with some driver lines , expression of the myr : :GFP from the TaG-EM construct may be too weak to allow robust enrichment of the tagged cells , adding an additional hexameric GFP construct could boost expression of weak driver lines to levels that are sufficient for robust detection of labeled flies or larvae ( Figure 5B ) and for labeling of dissociated cells for flow cytometry ( Figure 6-figure supplement 1 ) . However , we subsequently optimized the TaG-EM barcode enrichment by ( 1 ) using a longer spike-in primer that more closely matches the annealing temperature used during the 10x Genomics cDNA creation step , and ( 2 ) using a nested PCR approach to amplify
[DISCUSSION] While the utility of TaG-EM barcode-based quantification will vary based on the number of conditions being analyzed and the ease of quantifying the behavior or phenotype by other means , we demonstrate that TaG-EM can be employed to cost-effectively streamline labor-intensive assays and to quantify phenotypes with small effect sizes ( Figure 4 , Figure 4-figure supplement 2 ) . However , one distinction between the two approaches is that RABID-Seq relies on stochastic viral infection of mammalian cells while TaG-EM allows reproducible targeting of defined cell populations allowing unambiguous cell identification and potentially allowing the same cell populations to be assessed at different timepoints or in the context of different experimental manipulations . We excluded this poor performing barcode line from the fecundity tests ; however , backcrossing is often used to bring reagents into a consistent genetic background for behavioral experiments and could also potentially be used to address behavior-specific issues with specific
[METHODS] The following primers were evaluated to amplify the TaG-EM barcodes upstream of NGS : Forward primer pool : four primers with frameshifting bases to increase library sequence diversity in initial sequencing cycles were normalized to 10 µM and pooled evenly to make a B2_3'F1_Nextera_0-6 primer pool : SV40_pre_R_nextera is designed to produce a shorter amplicon ( 200 bp with",,966,97,None,"Cells are made up of many different types of cells . Each cell has a specific type of cell , and each cell is able to produce a particular type of gene . This process is called gene expression , which can be used to identify the cells that make up a cell . However , it is not clear how this process works . In flies , for example , a gene called GFP is expressed in a single cell and can be identified by a barcode . The barcode can be read out from the fly’s genome , but it is also possible to use a technique called targeted genetically-encoded multiplexing ( TaG-EM ) to identify cells that are different from each other . To do this , the fly needs to have a set of genetically encoded genes , such as a protein called gFP , that can be inserted into the DNA of a fetus . Using this technique , researchers can identify the cell types that are most likely to be involved in the cell’s activity . These cells can then be tagged using a method called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing . A technique called TaG–EM uses a genetic barcode to insert a DNA barcode into a polyadenylation site , where it is inserted . Once the barcode has been read out , scientists can then use it to create new cells , or to test the results of the experiments . For example if a fly has been exposed to different conditions , then the fly can be tested in vivo ."

[ABSTRACT] In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics , we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins . Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration - passive accumulation - that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation . Here , we provide new data showing that , in contrast to previous studies , species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids . However , taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species , without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended . Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times . We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms . We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants , which are known sources of alkaloids . As a result , our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete . Thus , our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype . Understanding the origins of novel , complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology .
[INTRODUCTION] Applying ideas from pharmacokinetics to acquired chemical defenses leads us to propose a four-phase evolutionary model , which we call the passive-accumulation hypothesis : ( 1 ) consistent exposure to a toxic compound ; ( 2 ) prior existence or evolution of some resistance to the toxin ; ( 3 ) change in the elimination rate of the compound that leads to its prolonged retention , hereafter passive accumulation ; and ( 4 ) adaptation of molecular pathways to transport and store the compound in a specific location , hereafter sequestration , which results in the chemical defense phenotype . Herein we use similar terms that are more directly relevant to the study of acquired chemical defenses : toxin intake , or the amount of toxin consumed ; toxin elimination , or the metabolic detoxification and/or elimination of toxins from the body ( equivalent to Metabolism +Excretion ) ; toxin sequestration , or the transport and storage of toxins to a specific location such as the skin ( a modified version of Distribution ) ; and toxin accumulation , or the retention of toxins in an animal , whether or not it is by sequestration processes . Although in the 1990s Daly and his colleagues proposed that an alkaloid uptake system was present in the ancestor of Dendrobatidae and is overexpressed in aposematic species , no details about this purported system were given , and little focus was placed on the physiological processes of alkaloid sequestration in poison frogs for nearly 20 years . According to the phylogenetic placement of defended and undefended species within Dendrobatidae , poison frogs have evolved sequestration of lipophilic alkaloids from consumed arthropods at least three times , making them a suitable group to study complex phenotypic transitions like the evolution of chemical defense . The other 245 species compose several other primarily inconspicuously colored clades that for the most part have been assumed to lack alkaloid defenses : that is , all Aromobatinae ( e. g. Allobates , Rheobates , Anomaloglossus , and Aromobates ) , all Hyloxalinae ( Ectopoglossus , Hyloxalus , Paruwrobates ) , and some Colostethinae ( Colostethus , Silverstoneia , Leucostethus ; Figure 1 ) . However , the evolutionary trajectory that animals take to traverse an adaptive landscape from one phenotype to another may be difficult to reconstruct given that they often must cross or avoid adaptive valleys , which include
[DISCUSSION] We also performed a highly sensitive , untargeted analysis -ultra-high-performance liquid-chromatography heated-electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS ) - of a dendrobatid from an undefended clade ( S. flotator ; 12 individuals ) and a species of eleutherodactylid ( Eleutherodactylus cystignathoides ; 3 individuals ) , in which alkaloid diversities and types , but not quantities , were assessed . The large number of structures that we identified is in part due to the way we reviewed GC-MS data : in addition to searching for alkaloids with known fragmentation patterns , we also searched for anything that could qualify as an alkaloid mass spectrometrically but that may not match a previously known structure in a reference database . This finding in concert with the detection of low levels of alkaloids in the lineages that putatively lack chemical defenses leads us to hypothesize that dietary shifts are not sufficient to explain the presence or absence of the chemical defense phenotype within Dendrobatidae or
[METHODS] With respect to the compounds exclusive to the positive reference sample ( i. e. not present in the frog skins ) , at > 99 % confidence , the algorithms implemented in SIRIUS also predicted annotations consistent with an epibatidine alkaloid for a feature only detected in the positive reference sample , at the levels of most specific class ( 'epibatidine analogues",,914,94,None,"The frogs that live in the wild are known to have evolved chemical defenses to protect themselves from toxins . These defenses are made up of molecules called alkaloids , which are found in the skin of animals . The toxins are then stored in the body and transported to a specific location , such as the skin , where they can be used as a drug . However , it is not clear how these chemicals are absorbed into the body , or how they are stored . To understand how these defenses work , researchers need to understand how the animals are able to survive in the environment . One way to do this is to look at the food they eat . In the wild , a group of poison flies , called the Dendrobatidae , has evolved a new chemical defense system . This system consists of a process called passive accumulation , in which the toxins that are ingested from the body are stored in a particular location . It is thought that this process is similar to that of sequestration , but it has not been studied in detail . Now , Sánchez et al . have used new data from poison  Frogs to study how this process evolved . They found that the dendrobatinae that ate mites and ants had a higher level of alkaloides than the undefended . Thus , the fungi that eat these fungus have a lower level of toxin , and therefore , they are more likely to be exposed to toxins from their diet . Moreover "

[ABSTRACT] In this study , we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells . The complexity of EMT , involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process , mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ) , has hindered the development of effective treatments . Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer . RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signalings are essential for EMT/MET completion . Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies . Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) contributes significantly to chemotherapy resistance and remains a critical challenge in treating advanced breast cancer . Our findings revealed elevated ribosome biogenesis ( RiBi ) during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes . Importantly , inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells .
[INTRODUCTION] Importantly , post-EMT ( GFP+ ) , mesenchymal tumor cells consistently demonstrated robust chemoresistant features compared to their parental epithelial cells ( pre-EMT RFP+ ) , inspiring us to further study chemoresistance using the Tri-PyMT model . To investigate the EMT process in metastatic tumor progression , we previously developed an EMT lineage-tracing model ( Tri-PyMT ) by combining MMTV-PyMT , Fsp1 ( S100a4 ) -Cre , and Rosa26-mTmG transgenic mice . Therefore , we proposed that instead of targeting epithelial or mesenchymal phenotype , inhibiting a biological process mediating the transitions of both EMT and MET could effectively overcome the limitations of traditional strategies . Rheenen 's group also posited that the Fsp1-Cre mediated EMT lineage tracing model might not accurately capture the majority of EMT events in comparison to an E cadherin-CFP model . Although we disagree with this assessment of the Fsp1-Cre model 's fidelity in tracing EMT , we acknowledge the limitations of relying on a single EMT marker to investigate the EMT contributions in tumor metastasis . Multiple growth factors ( TGFβ , EGF , Wnts , etc ) , signaling pathways ( Smad2/3 , PI3K/Akt , ERK1/2 , etc ) , EMT transcription factors ( Snail , Twist , Zeb1/2 , etc ) , and hundreds of downstream EMT related genes are involved in the EMT program . Notably , using the refined EMTracer animal models , Li et al. , 2020 discovered that N-cadherin + cells , rather than the Vimintin + cells , were predominantly enriched in lung metastases . The absence of EMT reporting in metastatic lesions in this model has sparked a lively debate about the proper definition of EMT status in tumor cells and the biological significance of EMT in tumor progression . These findings with different mesenchymal-specific markers underscore the complex nature of the EMT process ; metastasis formation does not necessarily require the expression of many traditional mesenchymal markers . The Tri-PyMT model , despite its limitations in comprehensive tracing of metastasis , provides unique opportunities to study EMT 's role in tumor progression and chemoresistance . Tumor cells exploit the transdifferentiation program of EMT to acquire aggressive properties , including anchorage-independent survival , invasion , and stemness . However , these approaches may paradoxically promote the reversed process of EMT , MET , which also contributes to malignancy development . This model traces EMT
[RESULTS] Collectively , these results suggest that the elevation of the RiBi pathway in cells at the EMT transitioning phase is associated with aberrant activation of ERK and mTOR signalings , which may , in turn , confer nascent protein synthesis capability to tumor cells for completing phenotypic changes . We posited that these RFP+/GFP+ ( Doub+ ) cells represent tumor cells transitioning from an epithelial to a mesenchymal state , since their fluorescent marker cassette has switched to GFP expression induced by Fsp1-Cre , while pre-existing RFP protein lingers due to its tardy degradation . Together , these results indicate that Doub+ Tri PyMT cells represent an active EMT-transitioning phase , as evidenced by well-established EMT markers ; specific activations of biological processes in
[DISCUSSION] Of note , some commonly used chemotherapeutics ( Cisplatin , 5FU , Doxorubicin , etc ) , although primarily targeting DNA duplications , may also affect the RiBi pathway by inhibiting rRNA processing . found that elevated rRNA synthesis/RiBi pathway was concomitant with cell cycle arrest induced by TGFβ , fueling the EMT program in breast tumor cells . Targeting EMT for cancer therapy has been challenging due to the complexity of the EMT process and controversies of promoting MET which also favors tumor progression . Using the Tri-PyMT model , we found that the EMT transitioning ( Doub+ ) cells had higher percentages of cells in the S and G2/M phases compared to the RFP + and GFP + cells . By employing our unique EMT-lineage-tracing model , we discovered that the RiBi pathway was transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of EMT/MET program . Importantly , the involvement of unwonted RiBi activities during both EMT and MET processes makes

For the epithelial or mesenchymal gene lists , we selected",,946,96,None,"Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in the world . However , it is also one of the most difficult forms of cancer to treat . In some cases , patients with breast cancer have to undergo a process called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which is a complex process that involves a number of different pathways . EMT is characterized by a series of changes in the cell’s ability to divide , divide and divide . This process is known as metastatic , and it is important to understand how this process works . The EMT process is regulated by many different genes , including a protein called ribosome . It is thought that the EMT pathway is involved in the reversal of the process of EMT and that this process is important for the survival and survival of the tumor . But it is not clear how EMT can be controlled . To investigate this question , Rheenen et al . developed a new model that combines a mouse model with a genetically engineered mouse model to study EMT in mice . These mice were then injected with chemotherapeutic drugs . When the mice were treated with these drugs , the tumor cells were more resistant to the drugs compared to their normal counterparts . Using this model , they were able to show that EMT has a role in the development of tumors , but it was not clear whether this was the case with the mice , or whether the mice had a better understanding of the EIT process .

[ABSTRACT] In summary , our study suggests a conserved function for GRX genes in conferring root cell elongation and enhancing resilience of pearl millet to its Sahelian environment . Combining gene expression data , re-sequencing and re-annotation of one of these genomic regions identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene PgGRXC9 as the candidate stress resilience root growth regulator . Pearl millet is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops that provides a vital food source across the sub-Saharan Sahel region . Using crop modeling , we demonstrate that early drought stress is an important constraint in agrosystems in the Sahel where pearl millet was domesticated . Functional characterization of its closest Arabidopsis homolog AtROXY19 revealed a novel role for this glutaredoxin ( GRX ) gene clade in regulating cell elongation . Pearl millet 's early root system features a single fast-growing primary root which we hypothesize is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate . Furthermore , we show that increased pearl millet primary root growth is correlated with increased early water stress tolerance in field conditions . Genetics including genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) approaches identify genomic regions controlling this key root trait . Seedling root traits impact plant establishment under challenging environments .
[INTRODUCTION] However , in Africa , pearl millet yield remains low compared to its genetic potential because it is mostly cultivated in marginal lands in low-input and rainfed agricultural systems and the development and adoption of improved varieties is still limited . Here , we show that early drought stress after germination is a major constraint in Sahelian environments and that primary root growth is correlated with increased tolerance to this stress under field conditions in pearl millet . Today , it is the sixth cereal in terms of world production , and it is mostly cultivated in arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa and India where it plays an important role for food security . Pearl millet embryonic root system development is characterized by the formation of a fast-growing primary root that is the only architectural component of the root system for the first 6 days after germination ( DAG ) . Pearl millet was domesticated about 4500 years ago in the Sahelian part of West Africa and is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops . This strategy relies on the selection of root traits suitable for the specific characteristics of the target environment such as soil and climate but also agricultural practices . A combination of genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and bulk segregant analysis ( BSA ) on a bi-parental population identified one genomic region controlling this trait . Improved crops with optimized soil resources acquisition might be particularly relevant in low-input and rainfed agrosystems found in the Sahelian region of Africa . Breeding for root traits that could improve the crop root system efficiency has been proposed as one of the pillars of a second green revolution . Functional characterization of the closest homolog in Arabidopsis reveals a new role for GRX in the regulation of root growth through cell elongation in the root apical meristem . It requires a better understanding of stress patterns and the performance of individual root traits in real conditions and in response to different constraints . Combining RNAseq , re-sequencing , and re-annotation of this region , we identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene , PgGRXC9 as a potential candidate regulator . We hypothesized that the fast-growing primary root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment . Primary root development is an important contributor to seedling vigor and greatly influences plant
[RESULTS] To analyze the frequency and impact of such early drought stress , we first studied meteorological data collected for the past 21 years at the CNRA Bambey station , located at the center of the pearl millet growing region of Senegal and highly representative of the climate found in Sahelian West Africa . To identify the cellular process responsible for changes in root growth between the two parental lines , ICML-IS 11155 and SL2 , we used confocal microscopy to image and measure cell elongation in the root tip starting from the quiescent center ( Figure 2C , Figure 2-figure supplement 4 ) . Our analysis revealed a total of 447 significant SNPs across the pearl millet genome associated with primary root
[DISCUSSION] It invests the available seed reserves toward the growth of a unique primary root to rapidly colonize deeper soil layers rather than forming more root axes ( seminal roots for example ) as seen in other cereals . Based on our results , we speculate that this specific early root development strategy was selected during evolution to cope with the specific rain pattern encountered in the Sahel . Its seeds are small ( 8 mg on average , about 5 and 20 times lighter than wheat or maize seeds , respectively , for example ) with limited reserves available for early seedling growth . Pearl millet evolved and was domesticated in the Sahel .
[METHODS] Out of the range of statistical approaches for measuring the differences in allele frequency in BSA , Euclidean distance-based statistics as suggested by Hill et al. , 2013 was selected based on a preliminary study on which we tested the efficiency of the methods for QTL detection using simulations . Five replicates of each SL2 and ICML-IS 11155 pearl millet",,925,95,None,"Plants in the Sahelian region of Africa are able to survive in harsh conditions , such as drought .

[ABSTRACT] Here , the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts was investigated during movie watching to address the extent to which brain responses dynamically change depending on visual context . These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences , the underlying neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information . Specifically , the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when these are processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning . First , across contexts , concrete and abstract concepts are shown to encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions . Language is acquired and processed in complex and dynamic naturalistic contexts , involving the simultaneous processing of connected speech , faces , bodies , objects , etc . Conversely , when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word , the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing . How words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing is still unknown . However , these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered .
[INTRODUCTION] For example , the situated ( i. e. contextualized in the discourse but also in the physical setting in which processing occurs ) processing of concrete concepts like 'chair ' could be linked to many abstract internal elements like goals ( ' I want to rest ' ) , motivations ( ' I have been standing for 2 hr ' ) , emotions ( ' I would like to feel comfortable ' ) , and theory of mind ( 'is that older person more in the need of this chair than me ? ' In contrast , when an abstract concept is processed in a situated context ( for example the word 'love ' processed in a scene with people kissing ) , its representation will more heavily draw on regions involved in processing external , visual information that otherwise characterize more concrete concepts . Consequently , while more concrete concepts have external physical references ( they refer to objects or actions that are easily perceived in the world ) , more abstract concepts do not necessarily have such references ( they generally refer more to cultural and societal constructs or peoples ' inner states of mind ) . First , we submit that results from previous investigations of conceptual processing , which generally depict a stable dichotomy between concrete and abstract words , reflect the average experiential information of the type of situational context in which concepts are habitually experienced . Therefore , we predict that the neurobiological representation of concrete concepts , will be related to associated brain regions , because they retain experiences related to their physical referents that are predominantly characterized by sensory and motor information , . We predict that when a concrete concept is processed in displaced situations ( e. g. 'cat ' processed when discussing the general character traits of cats vs dogs ) , response profiles will shift towards more internalized processing shared with abstract concepts . We propose that this erosion of the concrete/abstract dichotomy for contextualized processing shows that both concrete and abstract concepts draw on information related to experience ( external and internal ) as well as linguistic association . In contrast , because their representations mostly reflect information related to internal/interoceptive/affective experience as well as linguistic information , we expect abstract concepts to activate brain regions associated with emotional , interoceptive , and
[RESULTS] To better understand the nature of this interaction and how it relates to response profiles associated with concreteness and abstractness across contexts , we contrasted concrete vs abstract modulation in situated and displaced conditions ( collapsing across timepoints , as we had no prediction about timing differences ) . Activation associated with the main effect of word_type overlapped with processing of concrete and abstract words across context in superior temporal sulcus , superior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus ( bilateral ) , in angular gyrus ( bilateral ) , in the central sulcus and precentral and postcentral gyrus ( right hemisphere ) , in lateral and medial frontal cortices as well as in the occipital lobe ( see Figure 4A ) .
[DISCUSSION] Apart from commercial applications , gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying naturalistic conceptual processing in the brain might bear important implications for clinical domains , e. g. , by informing progress towards helping patients who lost the ability to speak by real-time semantic reconstruction of non-invasive brain recordings with the help of large language models . These more distributed regions may be averaged away when indiscriminately analyzed together and following thresholding because ( i ) they are more variable given they are associated with different experiences ( as we have seen here ) , linguistic categories , and processes ( e. g. different types of syntax ) ( ii ) there are individual differences in all of these . We propose that this is because , when a concrete concept is processed in a displaced context , its representation will relate more to internal/interoceptive variables and linguistic associations , which are usually encoded by abstract concepts .
[METHODS] Conversely , when concrete concepts are displaced from the visual context ( e. g. processing the word 'apple ' while watching the interior of a house ) , we predict them to engage more abstract-like regions in the brain that are related to processing of internal/interoceptive/affective information . Note that we chose to do the analysis in two stages ( first",,949,96,None,"The brain processes information about the world around us , such as how we interact with our environment , and how we communicate with others . The brain is also involved in processing information about our surroundings , including how we feel , act , or interact with other people . For example , if we are in a movie , we may be able to hear the words “I love you” , “I want to rest” . But if the movie is not a real-world experience , it may be more abstract . In this study , Weiss et al . studied the brains of people watching movies . Using a computer , they found that the brain processes different types of information , like words , faces , bodies , objects , etc . When the movie was a non-real-world situation , the brain responded more strongly to abstract concepts than to concrete ones . This suggests that the underlying brain structure is not fixed , but depends on available contextual information . To better understand how the brain works , Heinz , Schroeder , Liu , Wang , Zhou , Chen ed . used a technique called MRI to examine the brain activity of abstract and concrete concepts during movie watching . They found that when the movie had a visual context , abstract concepts were more likely to be processed in the same brain regions as concrete concepts . However , when the visual context was unrelated to a given concrete word , these brain regions were more active . These results suggest that while abstract concepts generally encode habitual experiences , their underlying neurobiological organisation is not fix but depends dynamically on available context information"

[ABSTRACT] Most importantly , KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells . This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor , KVS0001 , that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo . As an intrinsic cellular pathway , nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations . We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen , based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts , to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells . Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy , its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface . KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role , including cancer and inherited diseases . This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1 's phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD .
[INTRODUCTION] Analysis of cell lines with loss of the UPF1 RNA helicase and ATPase gene ( UPF1 ) , a key mediator of NMD degradation , also showed increased levels of aberrant transcripts and mutant proteins in the alleles targeted by NMD . From this screen , we identify a lead compound capable of inhibiting NMD and ascertain its protein target as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -related kinase ( SMG1 ) , a kinase that is a critical mediator of NMD . This is reminiscent of the pharmacological modulation of splicing , which has also been shown to increase the number of neoantigens present on the cancer cell surface due to similar underlying mechanisms . This subset of mutations is of particular interest because they can result in proteins and derived peptides that are foreign to a host 's healthy cells , giving rise to neoantigens . As the lead compound produced unacceptable toxicity in animal models , we then designed a specific and bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of SMG1 that is well-tolerated in vivo . The typical adult solid tumor contains a median of 54 coding somatic nucleotide variants , many of which have the potential to create novel neoantigens or Mutation-Associated NeoAntigens . We then demonstrate that targeted inhibition of SMG1 by KVS0001 leads to the presentation of novel neoantigens identifiable by T-cells leading to tumor growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo . While many studies correlate tumor insertion and deletion ( indel ) mutation load with immunotherapeutic response , not all tumors with high indel mutational loads respond to checkpoint inhibitors . Despite early studies showing little toxicity with NMD inhibition , there is as of yet no reports of a specific chemical inhibitor of the pathway with good bioavailability . This prevents translation and presentation of peptides from these proteins on major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I complexes , rendering them invisible to immune cells . In this work , we create a cell-based high-throughput assay to query the effects of a curated library of small molecules on NMD function . In cancer cells , however , NMD may aid immuno-evasion by eliminating RNA transcripts coming from genes that carry truncating mutants . Despite success with cancer immunotherapies , approved immunotherapies are not available for the majority of cancer patients and only a minority of treated patients realize a durable response . In normal cells , nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) plays
[RESULTS] Finally , KVS0001 treatment of NCI-H358- and LS180-derived xenograft tumors in nude mice resulted in significant increases in transcript levels in each of six tested endogenous genes with truncating mutations , while having had no measurable effects on genes containing heterozygous coding region SNPs ( Figure 3G , H ) . We performed an HTS to identify more specific NMD inhibitors by treating the isogenic cell line panel described above with a commercially available library consisting of 2658 FDA-approved or in late-phase clinical trial small molecules and natural products ( Supplementary file 2 ) . Severe drug-associated toxicity , including weight loss bordering on cachexia and near total inactivity , precluded the longer-term dosing required for anti-tumorigenic effects of LY3023414 in both BALB/c and C57BL/6N immunocompetent mouse strains
[DISCUSSION] Whether this failure to cure tumors in mice results from the contrived nature of the models used - injection of large numbers of rapidly growing cancer cells into animals with relatively little time to react prior to their demise - complicates the interpretation of many pre-clinical immunotherapeutic approaches . Another unrelated compound has shown successful in vivo re-expression of mutant RNA transcripts , but the effect is reported as less than a twofold change , compared to the three to fourfold demonstrated here by KVS0001 , and little work has been done to develop the compound further in subsequent studies . This is an important feature , as many previously reported inhibitors of NMD , such as emetine and anisomycin , rely on inhibition of protein translation and thus are unlikely to be optimal for specific restoration of NMD-targeted RNA and protein expression . It is not clear to us why this occurred , but we speculate that it may be related to differences in the",,915,94,None,"Cancer cells are made up of many different types of cells , including the human body . The cancer cells contain a large number of genetic variants that can cause mutations in certain genes . These mutations can cause cancer cells to become more resistant to treatment . However , there is no cure for cancer , and it is not possible to treat all cancers . In some cases , the cancer cells have a mutation in one of the genes that causes the mutation . This can lead to the formation of a protein called nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) . NMD is a process that destroys the RNA that is produced by a gene . It is also known as a truncating mutation , because it can cause neoantigens to appear on the surface of cancer cells . One of the most common mutations that causes NMD in cancer cells is the deletion of the phosphorylation of the protein kinase SMG1 , which is responsible for the degradation of RNA . While this enzyme is known to be involved in splicing , it has not been shown to be used to inhibit the activity of this enzyme . To address this issue , Weiss et al . have developed a new drug that can inhibit NMD by targeting the enzyme , KVS0001 . Using this drug , we show that the drug increases the expression of the proteins that are produced by NMD-infected cells in vitro and in vivo , thereby reducing the number of nitric oxides that are present on the cancer cell surface . As the drug is able to be taken out of the cell , its effect on the production of peptides and other proteins is similar to that seen in the drug . Weis"

[ABSTRACT] We generated PhenoAge using chronological age and nine biomarkers , PhenoAgeAccel after subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression residual , and an incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score ( CPRS ) based on 20 cancer site-specific polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ) . Within and across genetic risk groups , older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer with adjustment for chronological age and the aging process could be retarded by adherence to a healthy lifestyle . Using Cox regression models , we examined the association of Phenotypic Age Acceleration ( PhenoAgeAccel ) with cancer incidence by genetic risk group among 374 , 463 participants from the UK Biobank . We explored a new measure of aging-Phenotypic Age ( PhenoAge ) -in the risk prediction of site-specific and overall cancer . Compared with biologically younger participants , those older had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer , with hazard ratios ( HRs ) of 1 . This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ; and the Excellent Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province . Age is the most important risk factor for cancer , but aging rates are heterogeneous across individuals . A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel was observed on overall cancer risk , with HRs of 2 . 11 ) for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared with those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge . PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors ( Beta = -1 . 22 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 31 ) in women , respectively . 51 ) for men and 1 . 27 ) in men , and 1 . 01 in men , p < 0 . 98 in women , p < 0 . 001 ; Beta = -0 . 18-1 . 26 ( 1 . 22-1 . 29 ( 2 . 10-2 . 94 ( 1 . 78-2 . 001 ) .
[INTRODUCTION] Recently , Morgan and colleagues developed and validated a novel multi-system-based aging measurement , PhenoAge , which has been shown to capture long-term vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19 , and strongly predict morbidity and mortality risk in diverse populations . Recently , we systematically created site-specific cancer PRS for 20 cancer types , and constructed an incidence-weighted CPRS to assess the effect of genetic risk on overall incident cancer risk based on the UK Biobank . Although the effect of these individual loci is relatively modest on cancer risk , a PRS combining multiple loci together as an indicator of genetic risk has been proved to effectively predict the incidence of site-specific cancer . We also assessed the extent to which a level of accelerated aging was associated with an increased overall cancer risk across groups with a different genetic risk defined by the CPRS . Thus , measurement of an individual 's biological age , particularly at the early stage of life , may promote the primary and secondary prevention of cancer through earlier identification of high-risk groups . To date , more than 2000 genetic loci have been identified as susceptibility markers for certain cancers by genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) . However , it is largely unknown whether PhenoAge can predict overall cancer risk and identify high-risk individuals for potential personalized prevention . In this study , we calculated PhenoAge in accordance with the method described previously and then evaluated the effectiveness of PhenoAge in predicting the risk of overall cancer in the UK Biobank . The morbidity and mortality of cancer increase dramatically with age , which demonstrates that aging is the greatest risk factor for cancer . Cancer continues to be the leading cause of death globally and the reduction of cancer-related deaths remains to be a public health priority . Therefore , the variation in the pace of aging between person may reflect the differences in susceptibility to cancer and death . However , the extent to interaction between genetic factors and PhenoAge on overall cancer risk remained unclear
[RESULTS] The PhenoAgeAccel was significantly associated with increased risk for cancer sites of lip-oral cavity-pharynx , esophagus , stomach , colon-rectum , pancreas , lung , breast , cervix uteri , corpus uteri , prostate , kidney , bladder , multiple myeloma , Hodgkin 's disease , and lymphoid leukemia , while negatively associated with risk of prostate cancer after adjusting for chronological age and other covariates ( Figure 2 , Supplementary file 1a ) . After removing participants who had withdrawn their consent , had been diagnosed with cancer before baseline , failed to be genotyped , reported a mismatch sex with genetic data , or with missing
[DISCUSSION] Older age has been long recognized as the main risk factor for cancer , and the multistage model of carcinogenesis posits that the exponential increase in cancer incidence with age were mainly resulted from the sequential accumulation of oncogenic mutations in different tissues throughout life . Based on data from the UK Biobank , recently explored the associations between telomere length and risk of several diseases , and reported significant positive associations of telomere length for lymphoid leukemia , multiple myeloma , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , esophagus cancer , while negative associations for malignant neoplasm of brain , mesothelioma , and melanoma . In summary , our study showed that accelerated aging , which was measured by PhenoAgeAccel , was consistently related to an increased risk of several site-specific cancer and overall cancer with adjustment for chronological age , within and
[METHODS] Besides , to examine the reliability of our results , we conducted several sensitivity analyses : ( 1 ) reclassifying PhenoAgeAccel levels based on quartiles ( bottom , 2-3 , and top quartiles defined as low , intermediate , and high accelerated aging , respectively ) or tertiles ( corresponding to low ,",,1014,99,None,"Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide , and it is estimated that more than 1 . 5 million people are at risk of developing cancer . However , there is a growing body of evidence that aging is the most important risk factor for cancer , but it is not clear whether this is the case . In the UK Biobank , 374 , 463 people were recruited to study the effects of aging on cancer risk . The results showed that , compared to those with a chronological age , those who were older had a significantly higher risk of cancer compared with those who did not . This suggests that the aging process could be retarded by adherence to a healthy lifestyle . Using a combination of Cox regression models , Morgan et al . developed a new measure of a person’s aging-Phenotypic Age ( PhenoAge ) , which measures the number of years they have been living . It was then used to predict the risk of occurrence of cancer in the UK . These results suggest that a level of accelerated aging may be associated with an increased risk of the disease . As a result , older people are more likely to develop cancer if they are able to maintain a good lifestyle , such as a healthier diet ."

[ABSTRACT] Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved accuracy . The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data , compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas , may explain this improvement . Species identification accuracy exceeds 95 % for birds , reptiles , mammals , and amphibians , but seed plants , molluscs , and fishes scored below 90 % . The Biome mobile app , launched in Japan , efficiently gathers species observations from the public using species identification algorithms and gamification elements . Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions , aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment . Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems . Here , we investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on SDM performance . For endangered species , traditional survey data required > 2000 records for accurate models ( Boyce index ≥ 0 . 9 ) , while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300 . Nonetheless , community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases . Species distribution models ( SDMs ) estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias . The app has amassed > 6 million observations since 2019 . Comprehensive biodiversity data is crucial for ecosystem protection .
[INTRODUCTION] Thus , although much effort has been invested in developing effective monitoring and modelling methods for biodiversity assessment , current approaches can be further improved by incorporating ( i ) more enjoyable community-based survey platforms using mobile applications and ( ii ) employing an advanced statistical modelling framework in estimating species distribution . As an indirect but influential way , KM-GBF requires companies to `` monitor , assess , and transparently disclose their risks , dependencies and impacts on biodiversity through their operations , supply and value chains and portfolios , `` which is guided by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures ( TNFD ) . In essence , community-sourced data , owing to its extensive sampling across time and space , has the potential to test existing ecological theories , expand our comprehension of ecosystems and the underlying processes , eventually allowing us to forecast ecological dynamics in the context of climate change . Traditionally , distribution data was acquired through on-site surveys by experts ( people have expertise about biodiversity ) , but collecting distribution data with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution is challenging if we rely only on such limited human resources . These datasets have been instrumental in assessing the impacts of climate change and urbanisation on phenology , detecting distribution changes including invasive alien species , exploring large-scale geographic variations in traits , and estimating species distributions . For supporting species identification , Biome implements artificial intelligence ( AI ) algorithms that generate lists of potential species and enable users to seek help/suggestions from others for species identification ( Figure 1 ) as in other applications such as iNaturalist and eBird . This is more than four times greater than the number of records accumulated by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ( GBIF ) from any data sources including iNaturalist and eBird during the same period in Japan ( ca . Also , while community-sourced data often suffer from spatially biased sampling efforts , SDMs such as MaxEnt can account for such spatial biases by considering the spatial distribution of sampling efforts when selecting pseudo-absence ( background ) locations . For example , users can earn 'points ' by contributing in various ways such as submitting records and suggesting species identifications to others , and their levels
[RESULTS] Among the records of wild individuals , at the species level , identification accuracy was higher than 95 % in birds , reptiles , mammals , and amphibians but less than 90 % in insects , fishes , and seed plants . SDMs using Biome + Traditional data , including Biome data at 50 % , were more accurate than those modelled only using Traditional survey data when the two datasets have the same amount of occurrence records ( Figure 3 ) . Our analysis revealed that although the intercept of the Boyce index ( BI , model accuracy metric that ranges between -1 and 1 ) did not differ between the two datasets ( generalised linear mixed
[DISCUSSION] Engaging a broader spectrum of stakeholders is crucial for effective biodiversity assessment , nature management planning , and nature-related financial disclosures : this inclusivity allows for the incorporation of traditional knowledge into planning processes , mitigates conflicts among stakeholders , and ultimately supports more seamless and informed decision-making . For instance , estimated distributions will be useful in selecting new protected areas or areas with Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures ( OECMs ) : allowing a wider range of land use as long as biodiversity and ecosystem services are sustained/improved . The most accurate model predictions were obtained when the training data consisted of 50-70 % Biome data ( Appendix 1 ) , highlighting the necessity of incorporating both traditional surveys and citizen observations for a comprehensive understanding of species distributions . By leveraging the distinct distribution patterns of Biome and Traditional survey data along environmental variables ( Figure 2C ) , the test
[METHODS] Since SDMs are influenced by invalid presence records , we assessed the quality of Biome data based on a total of 1420 records from rare and common species of seed plants , molluscs , insects ( including Arachnid and Insecta ) , fishes , mammals , birds , reptiles , and amphibians ( Figure 4 ) . These",,966,97,None,"Biodiversity is an important resource for the conservation of biodiversity . It is important to understand how ecosystems work and how they can be conserved . However , it is also important to know how species are distributed in an area . For example , if a plant or animal is found in a forest , this information can help to identify the species that are most likely to be present . This information is then used to create a model of the distribution of the species , which can then be used to assess the impact of climate change and urbanisation on the ecosystem . The model is then applied to the data collected by the public , and it can be used as a tool to assess how the environment is adapted to protect the species in question . In the past , surveys were carried out by experts , but now , with the help of a mobile app called Biome , more than 6 million people have been able to collect the data . Biome has been launched in Japan , where it has been used to gather information about the biodiversity of the surrounding areas . Since the app was launched in April 2019 , the app has collected more than six million observations from more than 132 species across Japan . Using Biome data , researchers found that the accuracy of the model was higher for birds , reptiles , mammals , amphibians , seed plants , fishes and seed plants than for other species . These findings suggest that the biome data can be combined with other data sources to better estimate the diversity of the natural environment . Furthermore , using Biome as an alternative to traditional survey data could help to better understand how biodiversity is distributed . Future research is needed to develop a more efficient and accurate model of biodiversity in the future . To do this , Biome will need to be integrated into the existing survey"

[ABSTRACT] In the present study using genetic mouse models , we dissected the roles of bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 1a ( Bmpr1a ) -mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and discovered that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis , leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions . However , deletion of Smad1/5 , two major BMP signaling downstream effectors , from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs , suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions . Although the cystic lesions are believed to result directly from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth , the extent to which developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells contribute to abnormal airway epithelial cell growth and subsequent cystic lesions has not been thoroughly examined . In addition , ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs . These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts . Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs . Abnormal lung development can cause congenital pulmonary cysts , the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown .
[INTRODUCTION] In addition to acting as a mechanical framework that supports the formation of the bronchi , bronchioles , and the distal alveoli , the lung mesenchyme provides a microenvironment that regulates the growth of epithelium through a variety of morphogenic signals , such as Wnts , fibroblast growth factors ( Fgfs ) , and bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) . We recently generated a lung mesenchyme-specific Tbx4 lung enhancer-driven loxP/Cre mouse driver line which enables us to manipulate BMP signaling specifically in lung mesenchymal cells in vivo and to study its role in the lung development . As reported by us and other groups , both hyperactivation and inhibition of BMP signaling in fetal lung epithelial cells result in lung malformation , which is primarily due to the defects in distal lung epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation/maturation . The primary lung epithelial buds then undergo reiterated elongation and division to form the conducting airways ( branching morphogenesis ) , followed by distal saccular formation and peripheral alveolarization to give rise to millions of gas exchange units . Therefore , investigating the abnormal lung phenotypes caused by lung mesenchyme-specific Bmpr1a knockout and revealing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms will significantly enhance our understanding of congenital lung diseases . Evidence has increasingly suggested that lung mesenchymal lineages , including airway and vascular smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) , pericytes , and stromal fibroblasts , are as important as epithelial cells in proper lung development . However , the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in regulating fetal lung development has not been studied due to the lack of lung mesenchyme-specific targeting tools in the past . It is known that lung development begins with the specification of the respiratory domain in the ventral wall of the anterior foregut endoderm , as indicated by the expression of Nkx2-1 , and the separation of the respiratory tract from the dorsal esophagus . Herein , we specifically deleted Bmpr1a in fetal lung mesenchymal cells , which resulted in abnormal airway development and subsequent prenatal cystic malformation . Although Bmpr1a is expressed predominantly in fetal mouse lung airway epithelial cells at the early gestation stage ( embryonic day [ E ] 12 . BMPs bind to the receptor complex of BMP receptor
[RESULTS] To investigate the distinct effects of the Bmpr1a-mediated pathway on non-vascular SMCs vs. vascular SMCs , primary fetal lung mesenchymal cells were isolated from Tagln-YFP/Cspg4-DsRed double reporter mice , in which airway SMCs/myofibroblasts were solely labeled with YFP expression while vascular SMCs and pericytes were marked by both YFP and DsRed expression ( Figure 5A ) . Whole mount staining of smooth muscle actin and comprehensive 3D imaging revealed a specific absence of airway SMCs surrounding the dilated airway branching in Bmpr1a CKO lungs , while unaffected airway branches in Bmpr1a CKO lungs remained surrounded by SMCs , as compared to the WT lungs ( Figure 2C ) . Despite severe disruption of airway SMC development in the
[DISCUSSION] It is worthy to note that airway smooth muscles are normal in these elastin null mice , implying that loss of elastic fiber alone is not sufficient to cause airway cystic pathology , but could serve as an additional factor contributing to the lesions in vivo . This aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute to airway cyst formation , as multiple mouse models have suggested that loss of Sox2+ or expansion of Sox9+ in airway epithelia are associated with altered epithelial differentiation and branching , as well as cystic pathology in fetal lungs . Evidence increasingly suggests that the lung mesenchyme is closely involved in respiratory lineage specification and epithelial differentiation by producing many critical signaling molecules , such as Bmp ligands , that direct endodermal expression of specific cell markers in a temporal and spatial fashion . It has been reported that epithelial overexpression of Bmp4 appears to induce extensive mesenchymal SMC
[METHODS] To study the role of BMP signaling in subpopulations of SMCs , lung mesenchymal cells from Tagln-YFP/Cspg4-DsRed reporter mice were further sorted into perivascular SMCs and non-perivascular SMCs based on their fluorescent reporter expression using FACS ( BD , FACSAria I ) . The cells were then plated at low density ( ~104/100 mm dish ) and cultured",,971,97,None,"The lungs of newborns are made up of many different types of cells , including the bronchi , the lungs , and the airways . These cells are called mesenchymal cells and are responsible for the formation of the pulmonary tubes . However , it is not clear how these cells are involved in the development of the lung . In the early stages of development , a small group of cells called the elastin fibers ( or fibroblasts for short ) , which are found in the fetal lung , develop into cysts . The cysts are caused by a protein called bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 1a ( Bmpr1a ) that helps to regulate the growth of the airway . This protein is known to be involved in regulating the growth and development of a variety of other cells . It is also known that the BMP signaling pathway is involved in controlling the development and growth of ethylcholine , an important component of the respiratory tract . To investigate this , Weiss et al . used genetically engineered mice to study the role of BMP in the lung development of their fetus . They used a mouse model of the cysts to study how the phenotypes of cysts were affected . Using the mouse model , we found that the cystic airways of the mesentchymal BMP receptor1a knockout lungs were abnormally shaped , with the resulting cysts becoming cystic . Although the cyst was caused by the loss of the gene for BMP-receptor 1a , this was not the case in the mutant mice . Instead , our results showed that the mutations in BMP-1 and BMP-2"

[ABSTRACT] However , the role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells is not fully understood , as it is difficult to visualize the local lipid domains around EGFR . Here , we visualized both EGFR and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy . Artificial reduction in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF . The EGFR and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains . Anionic lipid molecules , including phosphatidylinositol-4 , 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) , are implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Thus , EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 around EGFR molecules were found to be mutually regulated . The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ , the EGFR effector hydrolyzing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . Inhibition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654 .
[INTRODUCTION] This dimerization results in the phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the tail region and the recruitment of intracellular signal proteins , such as growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 ( GRB2 ) and phospholipase Cγ ( PLCγ ) containing Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) and/or phosphotyrosine-binding regions . Apart from these in silico and in vitro studies , the localization and roles of PS and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 during EGFR activation have not been fully investigated experimentally in living cells due to the difficulty of visualizing the local lipid domains around EGFR in the plasma membrane . Multiscale molecular dynamic simulations have suggested that phosphatidylinositol-4 , 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) interacts specifically with the basic residues in the JM-A region , stabilizing the JM-A helices in an orientation away from the membrane surface by binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . Among these techniques , single-molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ) , which includes photoactivated localization microscopy , fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy , stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) , ground-state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecular return , and direct STORM , allows the construction of super resolved images with high-precision localization of individual fluorophores . After EGFR binds to epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , the extracellular region adopts conformations favoring the dimerization of the transmembrane helices near their N terminus and the dimerization of the JM region , inducing the formation of asymmetric ( active ) dimers of the intracellular kinase region . In addition to these in silico analyses , our recent in vitro study using nanodisc techniques suggested that phosphatidylserine ( PS ) and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 stabilize the conformation of the JM-A dimer . The JM region of EGFR plays a crucial role in the conformation-dependent coupling of EGFR 's binding to EGF and its activation and dimerization . Superresolution imaging techniques that break the diffraction limit have become a powerful tool for visualizing cellular structures with unprecedented resolution . Both these JM regions contribute to the stable formation of an asymmetric kinase dimer , which is important for kinase activation . EGFR is subdivided into five regions : a large extracellular
[RESULTS] To test this , we reduced the content of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 by expressing synaptojanin ( SYNJ ) , a phosphatase that hydrolyzes PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , and measured the size of the EGFR-Halo oligomer in EGFR-null Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) -K1 and EGFR-KO HeLa cells by SMT analysis ( Figure 4A , Figure 4-figure supplement 1A ) . When we stimulated the selected cell line with EGF , the EGFR-rsKame and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) in the cell line were phosphorylated to the same levels as in the parental HeLa cells ( Figure 1-figure supplement 2A and B ) , indicating that the EGFR-rsKame fusion
[DISCUSSION] Together with these observations , our biochemical analyses suggest that the local distribution of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 around EGFR before EGF stimulation not only acts as the substrate of EGFR effectors , including PI3K and PLCγ , after EGF stimulation , but also plays a crucial role in enhancing the dimerization and kinase activation of EGFR immediately after EGF stimulation ( Figure 7E , left ) . Previous electron microscopy-bivariate analyses showed that the nanodomains of inactive HRAS were enriched with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , whereas those of active KRAS4B were enriched with PS due to highly specific RAS-lipid interactions determined by the membrane curvature . Such faint increases were difficult to observe in our SMLM imaging under dense EGFR expression ( Figure 1 ) ; however , SMT analysis detected increases in the singe-spot fluorescence intensities , which is consistent with EGF-induced EGFR clustering
[METHODS] We developed and used a multi-distance spatial cluster analysis program to estimate the size and distribution of nano-domains automatically ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1D-F ) , where the local point density around each point was compared with that for the random distribution based on the Ripley 's K-function , K ( r ) , and its variants for",,971,97,None,"The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a protein that is found on the surface of the skin . Its activity is controlled by a group of proteins called kinases , which are involved in regulating the activity of the cell’s immune system . The kineses are made up of lipid molecules called lipids , and they are known to be involved in the regulation of the activity and function of the ER cell . However , it is not clear how these molecules interact with each other , or how they interact with one another . In this study , we used a technique called super-resolution microscopy to study the interaction between EGRF and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . We found that the PI and P2 nanodomains of the plasma membrane of HeLa cells were able to aggregate before the stimulation of EGF . This was due to the presence of a molecule called phosphatidylinositol-4 , 5-bisphosphate ( PI ) . PI is also found in a number of other molecules , including phospholipase C , the enzyme responsible for phosphorylating PI in the endocytic region of the epidermis . These phospholipids are found in the outer layer of the cells , where they are found , but they are not found in any other part of the body . Therefore , our results suggest that PI plays a role in the activity , function and activity of this protein ."

[ABSTRACT] The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP , which powers energy-requiring processes , such as macromolecular synthesis , as well as NADH , used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules . Given its unique substrate specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism , the carrier for glycolytic intermediates identified here represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens , which are of great economic importance . Comparative analyses with the phylogenetically related human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier ( SLC25A11 ) and dicarboxylate carrier ( SLC25A10 ) show that the glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate . Stramenopiles form a clade of diverse eukaryotic organisms , including multicellular algae , the fish and plant pathogenic oomycetes , such as the potato blight Phytophthora , and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis . Here , we identify a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocystis that can transport glycolytic intermediates , such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate , across the mitochondrial inner membrane , linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis . In most eukaryotes , glycolysis is a strictly cytosolic metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate , resulting in the production of NADH and ATP ( Adenosine triphosphate ) . Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP , such as complexes III and IV , ATP synthase , and ADP/ATP carriers . In contrast , stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis in which the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix .
[INTRODUCTION] The group also includes multicellular algae ( kelps ) and the economically devastating oomycetes , such as Phytophthora infestans , which causes potato blight , one of the major contributing factors of the Great Famine in Ireland in the late 19th century . The controversy may arise from the extreme genetic diversity of Blastocystis , which is classified into over 40 subtypes , and thus its influence on gut microbiota is likely to be subtype specific . All SLC25 members have a threefold pseudo-symmetric structure , evident at the sequence level by the presence of three conserved homologous repeats and specific motifs important for their transport mechanism . It is clear that the branched stramenopile glycolysis needs to be linked by a specific transporter in the mitochondrial inner membrane , as the solute exchange between the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix is tightly controlled . Glycolysis is a crucial metabolic pathway that most organisms use to obtain energy from the oxidation of sugars , which consists of 10 enzymatic reactions in total , divided into two phases . However , it was recently discovered that a large group of eukaryotes , the stramenopiles , have a branched glycolytic pathway in which the pay-off phase is duplicated and also localized in mitochondria . Instead , this carrier can transport several glycolytic intermediates , including dihydroxyacetone phosphate , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate , 3-phosphoglycerate , and phosphoenolpyruvate ( PEP ) , thus providing a previously undiscovered transport link between cytosolic and mitochondrial glycolysis . Nevertheless , Blastocystis ST7-B , which was used in this study , is most frequently associated with pathogenic phenotypes and was recently linked to a decreased microbial diversity in diarrheal patients . The structural differences between host and parasitic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and triosephosphate isomerase in Plasmodium falciparum have been studied with the aim of inhibiting glycolysis . The stramenopiles are an extremely diverse eukaryotic group consisting mainly of protist algae , which are among the most important primary oxygen producers in the oceans . Unlike other stramenopiles , Blastocystis has lost the cytosolic pay-off phase of glycolysis , consistent with the absence of a gene encoding a mitochondrial pyruvate carrier . We characterized one of
[RESULTS] We used detergent-solubilized , purified protein to screen a library of 39 commercially available compounds , which included mono- , di- , and tricarboxylates , acids , inorganic ions , and several glycolytic intermediates ( with the exception of 1 , 3-bisphosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate , which were not available ) . To test whether a compound was transported , we loaded proteoliposomes with substrate by freeze-thaw extrusion , and initiated exchange with the addition of radiolabelled [ 14C ] -malate ( hOGC and bOGC , Figure 3D , E ) or [ 35S ] -sulphate ( hDIC ) . The thermostability shifts for the Blastocystis orthologue bOGC were similar to those of hOGC
[DISCUSSION] Cytosolic ATP can be supplied either through the export of PEP by bGIC-2 , as explained , or via a mitochondrial carrier that shares properties with the mitochondrial Mg-ATP/Pi carrier , which is generally used to equilibrate adenine nucleotide pools between the matrix and cytosol . The plant carriers catalyse the transport of tricarboxylates ( citrate , isocitrate , and aconitate ) in exchange for dicarboxylates ( oxoglutarate , oxaloacetate , malate , maleate , succinate , and malonate ) and are also present in Alveolata , Rhizaria , and Haptophyta , which share a common evolutionary ancestor with stramenopiles . In most other eukaryotes , cytosolic NADH is oxidized by the malate-aspartate shuttle , but this pathway requires an orthologue of the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier , which could not be identified in Blastocystis , even though it might have a mitochondrial glutamate carrier ( Figure 1-figure
[METHODS] To investigate whether this clade is not only present in stramenopiles , but also unique to them , BLAST searches were performed using the unique stramenopile sequences against genomes from an expanded range of eukaryotes using NCBI and EukProt databases . Imidazole and NaCl were removed using a PD-10 desalting column according to the manufacturer 's",,993,98,None,"The digestive system is made up of a large number of cells , including the gut , which contains many different types of organisms . Most of these organisms are found in the gut of humans , but some of them are also found in other parts of the body , such as the intestines , the stomach , and the gastrointestinal tract . Some of these eukaryotic organisms use a process called glycolysis to convert sugars into pyruvate , or ATP . This process is called cytosolic glycolysis , where the enzymes that make ATP are located in the mitochondria . However , it is not clear how the stramenopiles are able to carry these intermediates across the mitochondrial inner membrane . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called X-ray crystallography to identify a protein called a glycolytic intermediate carrier . The experiments showed that a small molecule called dihydroxyacetone phosphate ( or DAP ) is transported across the inner membrane of the mitochondria to carry the intermediates from the cell to the cellular surface . It was also found that the bacterial yeast Blastocystis lacks a key component of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway , a crucial step in the production of ATP and adenosine triphosphate . These findings suggest that the glycolysis pathway in stranemopiles may be a potential drug target against these pathogenic bacteria . In addition , this study suggests that the transporter for the intermediate can also be used to transport other molecules , like malate and oxoglutarate ."

[ABSTRACT] We propose a new framework for human genetic association studies : at each locus , a deep learning model ( in this study , Sei ) is used to calculate the functional genomic activity score for two haplotypes per individual . Lastly , we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO ) regression to integrate HFS prediction score with SNP-based polygenic risk scores , which showed an improvement of 16 . Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations , corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared with single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) -based analysis . HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait associations and 153 tissue-trait associations with strong biological interpretability , including 'circadian pathway-chronotype ' and 'arachidonic acid-intelligence ' . Applying the HFS framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank , we identified 3619 independent HFS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8 . We concluded that HFS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits . This score , defined as the Haplotype Function Score ( HFS ) , replaces the original genotype in association studies . 8 % in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction . 1-39 .
[INTRODUCTION] In this study , we present an analytical framework founded on this strategy ( Figure 1 ) and implement it on complex traits in the UK Biobank to pinpoint causal loci and genes , decipher biological mechanisms , and devise cross-ancestry prediction models . Our findings confirm that the HFS framework offers a unique improvement in the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to classic SNP-based methods , thereby demonstrating its value in genetic association studies . This 'aggregated impact ' offers several benefits for GWAS analysis : it provides direct biological interpretations , bypasses the effects of LD and population genetic history , and amalgamates information from both common and rare variants . We segmented the human reference genome into multiple 4096 bp loci , generated DNA sequences for each locus for two haplotypes per individual , and employed Sei to compute the functional genomic activities of these sequences . One successful implementation of this strategy is Polygenic Transcriptome Risk Scores ( PTRS ) , which employ genetically determined transcription levels rather than genotypes to predict complex trait , and achieved remarkable portability . One caveat is that the statistical power of GWAS on a variant relies on its population frequency , whereas most variants with large effect size are rare , leading to insufficient discoveries . Given these advancements , we propose that using the outputs of one of the state-of-the-art DL models , Sei , as the 'aggregated impact ' in this novel strategy could effectively address the challenges aforementioned . The prevalent approach to addressing this issue is to annotate each variant based on its location within functionally significant regions , such as transcription factor-binding sites or enhancers . Nonetheless , the accuracy of imputing transcription levels from genotypes , given the sample size of currently available cohorts such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression project , GTEx , remains limited ( R2 around 0 . More precisely , by replacing the original genotypes in association studies with the aggregated impact of variants on transcription or functional genomics , the central dogma ensures the preservation of the majority of genetic information . While this strategy has considerably advanced the analysis , it is not optimal , as a variant 's placement within a functionally important region does not inherently signify that the variant has
[RESULTS] Then , in a small tuning sample of target ancestry , we calculated per-locus HFS prediction score of height ( sum of HFS within this block , weighted by SUSIE posterior effect size ) , then used machine learning to integrate them with LDAK PRS into a final polygenic prediction score , hereafter referred to as 'HFS + LDAK ' . We also highlighted other gene-trait association not previously emphasized by GWAS , including GATA4 and NPPA ( cardiac muscle hypertrophy ) with SBP , ALOX5 ( arachidonic acid metabolism ) with intelligence and CRY1 ( circadian pathway ) with chronotype , as further discussed in Supplementary file 1k , l , m and supplementary information . We applied this framework
[DISCUSSION] In this study , we designed the new HFS framework for genetic association analysis and demonstrated that it could improve classic SNP-based analysis in terms of causal loci and gene identification , biological interpretation and polygenic prediction . For those false-positive variants caused by LD , they are expected to make little impacts on functional genomics , thus their HFS would be close to reference and would not influence downstream analysis significantly . In summary , our results demonstrate that incorporating HFS to represent genetically determined functional genomic activities in genetic association studies offers robust improvements in both the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits . This limitation is likely due to the models ' inability to account for long-range regulatory patterns , which are crucial for understanding the impact of variants on gene expression and vary across genes . One potential solution is to extend the concept of HFS , applying DL to quantify
[METHODS] Among them , we chose sei to calculate HFS for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the required input length is moderate ; ( 2 ) it represents 21 , 906 functional genomic tracks , more comprehensive than other models ; ( 3 ) it integrated information of the entire sequence , not only the few bp at the",,963,97,None,"The human genome contains a large number of genetic variants , which can be found in many different types of cells . These variants can affect how genes work , how they interact with each other , and how they affect the body . However , it is not clear how these variants affect how the body functions . For example , some variants are more common than others , while others are less common . This means that it is difficult to predict which variants cause disease . One way to do this is to use genetic information from a single gene , called a haplotype function score ( HFS ) . The HFS score is used to predict the activity of a gene in a population , such as genes that are involved in the production of proteins . It can also be used to identify the genes that make up a trait , like a chromosome , or a protein called arachidonic acid . In the UK Biobank , researchers have been using a technique called Deep Learning ( DL ) to predict how many variants there are in the human genome . DL is a machine learning algorithm that can be applied to a wide range of complex traits , including cancer , heart disease , diabetes , Parkinson’s disease and cancer . Previous studies have shown that DL can be used in association studies to predict genes that affect how people develop . Now , Wang et al . have developed a new approach to predicting how many genes are in an individual’s genetic profile . They used a method called Sei to calculate the activity score of each gene in the genome of 14 complex traits in the UK biobank . To do this , they used DL to map the DNA sequences of each individual , then used the results to build a model"

[ABSTRACT] The current study assessed whether three different types of 3 months mental Training Modules geared towards nurturing ( a ) attention-based mindfulness , ( b ) socio-affective , or ( c ) socio-cognitive skills may impact hippocampal organization by reducing stress . We observed increases in bilateral cornu ammonis volume ( CA1-3 ) following the 3 months compassion-based module targeting socio-affective skills ( Affect module ) , as compared to socio-cognitive skills ( Perspective module ) or a waitlist cohort with no training intervention . We evaluated mental training-induced changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity , by combining longitudinal structural and resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis in 332 healthy adults . Structural changes were paralleled by relative increases in functional connectivity of CA1-3 when fostering socio-affective as compared to socio-cognitive skills . Notably , using a multivariate approach , we found that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels . Overall , we provide a link between a socio-emotional behavioural intervention , changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function , and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults . The hippocampus is a central modulator of the HPA-axis , impacting the regulation of stress on brain structure , function , and behavior . Furthermore , training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output . We related these changes to changes in diurnal and chronic cortisol levels .
[INTRODUCTION] While such inconsistencies in previous neuroimaging work may reflect the fact that different indices of diurnal cortisol tap different facets of HPA axis regulation , the samples studied have been diverse in terms of health status , small in size , and largely cross-sectional . We evaluated the longitudinal relationship between hippocampal subfield volumetry , a quantitative index of hippocampal grey matter , and studied whether volumetric changes were paralleled by subfields ' resting-state functional connectivity in a large sample of healthy adults participating in the ReSource Project . To close these gaps , we here investigate the differential efficiency of three types of mental training ( attention-based , socio-affective and socio-cognitive ) on their ability to induce structural as well as functional plasticity of hippocampal subfields and reduce diurnal cortisol levels . Furthermore , 8 weeks mindfulness programs such as MBSR and others typically cultivate different types of mental practices , making it difficult to understand which type of mental practice is most efficient in reducing different types of outcomes , including various stress-markers . In recent years , contemplative mental training interventions , such as the mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) program or compassion-focused therapy , have gained in popularity as potential therapeutic tools to improve mental and physical health and reducing stress . Hippocampal structure was quantified via a surface-based multi-template algorithm that has been shown to perform with excellent accuracy in healthy and diseased populations of a comparable age range as the currently evaluated cohort . We expect that assessment of hippocampal sub-regions may help to accurately map circuit plasticity as a result of potential stress reduction , and to observe that changes in hippocampal structure are paralleled by changes in functional connectivity of hippocampal subfield functional networks . This enabled us to evaluate training effects on hippocampal structure , function , and their associations with cortisol as a function of mental training targeting either attention-based mindfulness ( Presence ) , socio-affective ( Affect ) , or socio-cognitive ( Perspective ) skills . Having a three layered allocortex , the hippocampal formation consists of multiple subfields , or zones , starting at the subiculum ( SUB ) and moving inward to the hippocampus proper , the cornu ammonis ( CA1-3 ) ,
[RESULTS] We employed a multivariate partial least squares method , with 1000 permutations to account for stability and bootstrapping ( 100 times ) with replacement , which aims to identify the directions in the predictor space that account for the most variance in changes observed , by creating latent variables . Last , we explored whether associations of subfield volume were found with levels of hair cortisol , a long-term marker of systemic cortisol exposure , in a sub-sample of N=44 participants repeatedly tested across modules ( Presence , Affect , and Perspective ) , based on previous observations of domain-general effects of mental training on cortisol and cortisone . When evaluating overall associations between diurnal cortisol change
[DISCUSSION] Thus , we can not at this point derive a consistent pattern of how mental training influences different indices of cortisol activity , yet we do find a consistent change in CA1-3 following Affect training , and observe domain-general patterns of change associations between CA1-3 and cortisol markers , indicating CA1-3 may play a central role within the context of Affect training and diurnal stress reduction based on univariate analysis . In the current cohort , we could demonstrate widespread patterns of hippocampal functional connectivity to mesiotemporal , lateral temporal , together with anterior as well as posterior midline regions , lateral temporo-parietal , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices - a pattern in excellent accordance to previous studies probing hippocampal functional connectivity at rest in healthy populations , and outlining 'mesiotemporal ' components of default-mode networks . Future work , studying the hippocampal surface at higher granularity , for example though unfolding the

It is located at the top of the brain , and is responsible for regulating how much stress is produced in the brain during the day and night . The brain also controls how much cortisol is produced during the night , which is important for reducing the amount of stress in the body . However , it is not clear which types of mental training are most effective in reducing stress , or which types are the most effective . For example , if a group of healthy adults had been trained to be more mindful , they would be more likely to be able to reduce their cortisone levels . In this study , researchers used a technique called fMRI to examine the brain’s structure and function . This revealed that the brain has a three-layered structure called the cornu ammonis . These areas are called subfields , meaning that they start at the subiculum and move inwards to the cortex , where they form a complex network of cells called the cortex and the hemisphere . As a result , the brain becomes more aware of the environment , making it more likely that the cortex will respond to stress more efficiently . Moreover , these subfield regions were found to have a higher level of connectivity than the cortex itself , suggesting that these changes could be linked to a reduction in cortinosol levels in healthy adults . Further studies are needed to determine which type of training is most effective for lowering the levels of cort"

[ABSTRACT] However , it is unclear what fraction of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect , and whether the loci within an inversion could still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect . This shows that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation , at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion . While a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation , most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific , indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species . We find evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments , which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species . Because segregating inversions suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of LD between locally adapted loci , they are also commonly found to be associated with adaptive divergence . Here , we use genome-wide association studies to explore patterns of local adaptation in three species of sunflower : Helianthus annuus , Helianthus argophyllus , and Helianthus petiolaris , which each harbour a large number of species-specific inversions . Local adaptation commonly involves alleles of large effect , which experience fitness advantages when in positive linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) .
[INTRODUCTION] We begin by using the strength of correlations between environment and phenotypes measured in a common garden to identify which environmental variables are likely driving local adaptation within each species , and use an index to quantify the relative similarity in these patterns among pairs of species ( see Appendix 1-figure 1 for a schematic overview of methods and research questions ) . To assess the similarity in these association statistics among species , we use methods similar to Yeaman et al. , 2016 to identify regions of the genome that exhibit greater similarity in signatures of association among pairs of lineages than expected by chance , which are likely driven by repeated adaptation using the same genes ( but not necessarily the same alleles ) . If most alleles have small effects relative to migration rate and can only contribute to local adaptation via the benefit of the recombination-suppressing effect of an inversion , then we would expect little repeatability at the site of an inversion - other species lacking the inversion would not tend to use that same region for adaptation because selection would be too weak for alleles to persist . Using broad sampling across the ranges of these species ( Figure 1 ) and sequencing data first published by Todesco et al. , 2020 , we study the genomic basis of local adaptation by conducting genome-wide scans for associations with climatic and soil environmental variables and phenotypes measured in a common garden . Here we use a conventional genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) approach with structure correction to study the basis of phenotypes , which vary both within and among populations , and use an uncorrected approach to test association to environment , which only varies among populations ( as all individuals within the same population have the same value of environmental variable ) . Taken together , our results show that local adaptation in sunflowers tends to involve both strong repeatability at a small number of genes , often associated with inversions , coupled with high redundancy and non-repeated responses across a much larger number of loci . Populations of H. annuus are distributed throughout the central and western United States and generally found on mesic soils , but can grow in a
[RESULTS] To identify windows of repeated association ( WRAs ) between pairs of species , we then assessed whether top candidate windows identified in one focal taxon also tended to be enriched for strong signatures of association to the same environment or phenotype in each of the other taxa ( using the null-W test , which tends to be more sensitive than just finding the overlap between the top candidate windows ; see 'Materials and methods ' ) . A second source of inflation in the number of WRAs is due to hitchhiking : if a given locus is a true positive driving adaptation , LD with other windows in tight physical linkage will result in spurious correlations causing
[DISCUSSION] Some of the 'usual suspects ' show up in the set of significantly repeated loci identified by PicMin : in addition to the homologs of the FT ( FLOWERING LOCUS T ) gene reported by Todesco et al. , 2020 , we also found hits for several other genes involved in circadian regulation and flowering time , including PRR3 , TOE1 , and PHYC , which is known to regulate photoperiodic responses in Arabidopsis accessions . This assumes that most loci in the genome are not involved in local adaptation , so that the relatively small proportion that are driving adaptation can therefore be picked out due to their tendency to fall into the tail of the distribution of association statistics in at least one other species ( which would only occur at the rate of random chance under a purely neutral model ) . Taken together , these results suggest that some
[METHODS] This SIPEC index is maximized when the correlation between a phenotype and an environmental variable is large in both species regardless of the direction , so it does not differentiate phenotypically convergent vs. divergent patterns of local adaptation ( e. g. increasing temperature causing an increase in flowering time in one species and a decrease in the other",,973,97,None,"Plants are able to adapt to changes in the environment , but they also have a limited ability to survive in the wild . In some species , such as Helianthus annuus , the plant can adapt to a variety of environmental conditions . However , it is not clear how adaptation can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect , which are often found in plants . One way to find out is to look at the genomes of three different species of sunflower . The sunflowers are found in the United States , where they can grow in a garden , and they can be found on mesic soils . This means that they can survive in areas where they are exposed to different environments . But it is unclear how adaptation is attributed , or how much of it can be explained by inversion . To investigate this question , Todesco et al . used a technique called genome-wide association studies to study the genetic basis of adaptation in three sunflower species . These analyses showed that inversion mutations are often associated with a number of different traits , including fitness , migration rate , genetic variation , etc . Most of the strongest signatures of association were found in regions of the genome that are likely to be affected by an inversion in one species compared to the other . Some of the signatures were particularly enriched in regions that were not affected by the inversion; however , some of these signatures still appear to be species-specific , suggesting that some of the mutations can still contribute to local adaptation . Further analysis revealed that the majority of signatures could still be derived from the same genes , even if they are not the same ones ."

[ABSTRACT] We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue , and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility . Epithelial expression variance of gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age , and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells . Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages , whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1 . In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression , we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity . Mammary luminal epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers . Effects from aging in single cells are heterogenous , whereas at the organ- and tissue-levels aging phenotypes tend to appear as stereotypical changes . Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers . A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype . The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages : luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells . We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger < 30 ( y ) ears old and older > 55 y women . We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation .
[INTRODUCTION] Stereotypical changes appear directional to the observer and are apparent at different physiologic scales , for example phenotypically though wrinkling , graying hairs , and increasing frailty ; cellularly through increasing organ dysfunction , and loss of bone density , muscle mass and fat pads ; and molecularly through decreasing levels of androgens and estrogens , and the upregulation or downregulation of gene or protein levels . Although our earlier work focused on a few select LEP-specific and MEP-specific markers , we hypothesized that the aging mechanisms we observed could impinge upon genome-wide maintenance of lineage fidelity and could thus be potential drivers of susceptibility to cancer initiation in breast tissue . We propose that this variability among individuals may itself be an important molecular phenotype of aging , and individuals with outlier expression profiles provide an avenue for understanding biological processes that explain the differences in cancer susceptibility between individuals as they age . We previously demonstrated loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia as an aging phenomenon-in which the faithfulness of expression of established lineage-specific markers diminishes with age without loss of the lineage-specificity of other canonical markers nor of the gross phenotypic and histological differences between LEPs and MEPs . Loss of lineage fidelity led to enrichment of genes and biological processes commonly dysregulated in cancers , and altered the LEP-MEP interactome that was significantly modulated by apical cell-cell junction proteins , such as GJB6 . The breast is an excellent model system for examining aging at the cellular and molecular levels because normal tissue from individuals spanning the adult lifespan is available from common cosmetic and prophylactic surgeries . Cultured pre-stasis human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) support growth of breast epithelial cell lineages from women across the lifespan and enable detailed , reproducible molecular studies of cancer progression . Using machine learning , we showed that genes that had age-dependent directional and variable changes in normal LEPs had predictive value in distinguishing normal breast tissue from breast cancers and in classifying breast cancer PAM50 subtypes . Directional responses reflect stereotyped changes associated with upregulation or downregulation of gene expression between younger and
[RESULTS] These included genes downregulated in the older group : TF BCL11A-a subunit of the BAF ( SWI/SNF ) chromatin remodeling complex , TF SOX4-involved in determination of cell fate , TF GRHL2 , and MLLT3-a chromatin reader component of the super elongation complex ; and genes upregulated in the older group : DPP4 ( CD26 ) -a cell surface receptor involved in the costimulatory signal essential T-cell activation , HSPA12A-a heat shock protein associated with cellular senescence , and KITLG-a ligand for the luminal progenitor marker c-KIT in breast . We highlight the top five genes that showed highest variable importance for each class : ( i ) Normal tissue-FN1 ,
[DISCUSSION] We also demonstrate how increased molecular noise during aging may lead to significant variances in the transcriptomes between aged individuals and propose that this mechanism could underlie differences in susceptibility to development of breast cancers , particularly luminal breast cancer subtypes . Because cancer susceptibility indicates a state that could be more easily pushed towards cancer initiation , we can consider the variances between aged individuals to occupy multiple metastable states , some of which represent susceptible phenotypes that can be perturbed towards development of specific cancers . Age-dependent directional and variant changes in LEPs even shape the tissue-level expression of predictive biomarkers that classify normal tissue and breast cancer subtypes , illustrating how age-dependent dysregulation in LEPs may play a key role in tissue transformation into frank cancers . Therefore , the degree to which breast-cancer associated genes are variably expressed across the different

It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors , including hormones , hormones and other chemicals . The cells that make up the mammary epithelium are called luminal epithelial cells ( LEPs ) and myoepithelial cell lines . These cells are found in the breast , but they are also found in other parts of the body , such as the lungs , liver , and intestines . When a person is aging , they become more likely to develop cancer . However , it is not clear how these cells become cancer-cells-of-origin . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called machine learning to study the expression of genes in luminal cells from women aged 30–55 years old . This revealed that the genes that make the cells that grow and divide are often more common than the ones that make them . In contrast , the genes in the luminal cell lines that make these cells are less common . Wang enlisted the help of a machine learning algorithm to identify genes that change with age . By analyzing the genes from luminal and myometrocyte cells , Huang ed . found that the changes in gene expression were more common among luminal or myometrin cells than among cancer cells . Moreover , a protein called GJB6 was found to be involved in a signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancer , suggesting that these cells may be the cells of origin for breast cancers and may be a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility ."

[ABSTRACT] Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of Thlaspi arvense , a rising crop and model species , and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads , usually discarded , can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions . We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress ( Thlaspi arvense ) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids , mildew , and other microbes . We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations , had significant SNP-based heritability , and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents . Moreover , we found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads , in particular differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure , likely induced by pathogens . Understanding the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance is an important goal in plant science , but it usually requires large and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments . Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load . Here , we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions . Specifically , pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats , presumably less favorable to aphids , showed higher aphid DNA load , i. e. , decreased aphid resistance . With rapidly increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide , this approach should have broad application in fundamental and applied research .
[INTRODUCTION] Whether inherited or induced , some strategies of plants for defense against pathogens and herbivores include : ( i ) physical barriers such as reinforced cell walls , leaf protective layers , or closing stomata , ( ii ) production of specialized ( secondary ) metabolites that reduce palatability or are toxic to pests , ( iii ) oxidative bursts , ( iv ) the activation of signaling cascades to induce systemic responses , and ( v ) RNA interference mechanisms to silence pathogen genes . Inspired by other recent studies on non-target reads , we asked if there was systematic variation in the numbers of aphid and pathogen reads among different T. arvense lines , and whether these data , together with our whole-genome plant sequencing data , could provide insights into the genomic basis of plant resistance variation . The goals of our study were thus twofold : ( i ) to contribute to a mechanistic understanding of pest resistance in T. arvense , and ( ii ) to explore whether non-target reads from plant sequencing can be used as proxies for studying plant biotic interactions . Prior to their whole-genome ( WGS ) and -epigenome sequencing these lines had been grown in a common environment , an open glasshouse where the plants were spontaneously colonized by aphids and powdery mildew , as well as by other microbes . In particular , antixenosis ( the prevention of pathogen settlement ) and antibiosis ( the repression of pathogen growth and reproduction ) require extensive and time-consuming phenotyping , based for example on choice or settling assays , and such assays are extremely challenging to perform on large collections . At the time of sequencing , pathogen contamination was still very limited but appeared highly variable , and preliminary analyses showed that it resulted in sizeable amounts of non-target reads assigned to the pest species , i. e. , contamination of the DNA samples . Considering that we are moving toward an increasingly sequencing-prone world , with more and larger datasets being generated for many species , the use of non-target reads has very broad potential . On the other hand , there are
[RESULTS] Our analysis had two steps : First we called differentially methylated regions ( DMRs ) between the 20 samples with the most and 20 samples with the least M. persicae or Erysiphales loads , and then we conducted epigenome-wide association ( EWA ) analyses on individual positions located within these DMRs , using the complete dataset ( 188 lines - see Materials and methods ) . Finally , to compare the power of a large database approach ( MG-RAST ) vs. using specific reference genomes , we also remapped all exogenous reads to the M. persicae and B. aphidicola genome assemblies and used the counts from these two mappings as additional phenotypes ,
[DISCUSSION] As we expected the observed climate-associated variation in pest loads to be at least partially explained by variation in chemical defenses , and since in A. thaliana glucosinolates , the main defensive compounds , are known to be geographically structured in response to aphid distributions , we also tested for association of aphid and mildew loads with glucosinolates in our collection . It also provides a proof of principle that exogenous reads from large sequencing efforts , usually discarded if not mapping to the target genome , can be leveraged to extract additional information about important biotic interactions of the target species , including its antagonists and microbiome components . These findings suggest that glucosinolate composition , rather than total amount , is important for aphid defense , and that while benzyl glucosinolate might have a deterrent effect , sinigrin might on the contrary attract M. persicae
[METHODS] We used the same approach for mildew except that we included only two possible species : B. graminis , as suggested by MG-RAST , and E. cruciferarum which is known to attack Brassicaceae but was not in the MG-RAST query database and seemed plausible from visual inspection ( Figure 2B ) . Out of the hundreds",,988,98,None,"Plants have evolved strategies to protect themselves from pests , including the use of genetically modified plants . Some of these strategies are inherited , while others are induced by other organisms . One of the most important strategies is to protect the plant from insects , such as aphids and mildew . However , it is not clear exactly how these strategies work . To understand how plants protect themselves , researchers need to study the genetics of the plants they grow in , and how they respond to pests and other environmental factors . This is particularly important because many plants have been genetically engineered to survive in environments that are cold or hot , but also in areas where they are less likely to be able to survive . In this study , the researchers used a technique called whole-genome sequencing ( WGS ) to study 207 natural lines of field pennycress , a species of plant that is growing rapidly in the United States . The experiments were conducted in a glasshouse , where the plants were randomly colonized by a number of different microbes and a variety of different plants , all of which were grown in the same environment . They found that the number of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations . These differences were mainly due to differences in the climate of origin and the level of glucosinolate in the soil . Further analysis revealed that the genes that are responsible for preventing pests from growing in the glasshouse were more likely to have been methylated , suggesting that these genes may have been affected by the environment , rather than by the pests themselves . Furthermore , some of the genes involved in the closing of the stomata of the plant were also enriched . Overall , these findings suggest that the use"

[ABSTRACT] In six selections with TCMDC-125334 , the most common mechanism of resistance to this compound was copy number variation of the dhodh locus , although we did identify one mutation , DHODH I263S , which conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265 . Finally , we tested whether collateral sensitivity could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of combination treatment by exposing wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously . We focus on one compound , TCMDC-125334 , which was active against all mutant lines tested , including the DHODH C276Y line , which arose in selections with the clinical candidate DSM265 . Drug combinations based on collateral sensitivity , wherein resistance to one drug causes increased sensitivity to the partner drug , have been proposed as an evolutionary strategy to suppress the emergence of resistance in pathogen populations . This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation which were cross-resistant to both compounds and were as fit as the wildtype parent in vitro . Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to malaria control and eradication efforts , necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat this disease . We found that selection of the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334 yielded additional genetic changes in the dhodh locus . We profiled the cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHODH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHODH inhibitors . These double mutant parasites exhibited decreased sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 and were highly resistant to DSM265 . In this study , we explore collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ) . The emergence of these cross-resistant , evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme .
[INTRODUCTION] Laboratory studies evaluating the evolution of resistance to antibiotics have demonstrated that when resistance to one inhibitor leads to collateral sensitivity to another , the two inhibitors can be used in a sequential cycling strategy to maintain sensitive bacterial populations , or simultaneously in combination to slow or suppress the evolution of resistance . We focused on the compound TCMDC-125334 , a DHODH inhibitor that exhibited increased activity against all mutant lines tested , including those that arose during selection with the clinical candidate DSM265 . The basic rationale for this strategy is that even if there is some probability of an organism acquiring resistance to each drug separately , the probability that two resistance mutations would occur simultaneously is much lower . While the clinical DHODH inhibitor candidate DSM265 showed promising activity in pre-clinical and clinical studies , we previously demonstrated that resistance to DSM265 emerges rapidly both in vitro and in a humanized mouse model of P. falciparum infection . In an effort to expand this work , we screened antimalarial libraries from GSK , and successfully identified several compounds with increased activities against DHODH mutants relative to wildtype parasites . Thus , there is a need to re-evaluate the current treatment approach , and to strategically design combination therapies based on their ability to slow or suppress the emergence of resistance . The emergence of resistance in Plasmodium parasite populations and subsequent treatment failure has been documented for all antimalarial drugs in clinical use , including frontline artemisinin combination therapies . The phenomenon of collateral sensitivity , or 'negative cross-resistance ' , has been observed across various antibiotic classes in bacteria , as well as anti-fungals , and even cancer therapies . Large-scale bacterial evolution studies have also shown that certain combinations of inhibitors can actually accelerate the emergence of resistance compared to treatment with a single inhibitor . In Phase 2 clinical trials with DSM265 , 2 out of 24 patients failed treatment due to resistance , with recrudescent parasites harboring mutations in dhodh including DHODH C276Y , C276F , and G181S . Antimicrobial resistance threatens our ability to combat multiple infectious agents , and is widely
[RESULTS] There are no published crystal structures for the DHODHC276Y so we used Flare 's mutate function to produce a model of DHODHC276Y , optimized the results in the absence of other molecules and then in the presence of TCMDC-125334 , orotate , and FMN with Flare 's protein minimize function , and rescored the result . Clonal lines isolated from flask 1 had two- or threefold copy number variation ( CNV ) encompassing the dhodh locus , which corresponded to a two- or three-fold resistance phenotype to TCMDC-125334 , as well as to the structurally distinct DHODH inhibitors DSM265 , Genz669178 , and IDI6273 . To better understand the binding mode of
[DISCUSSION] Our finding that sequentially treating the DHODH C276Y line with a second inhibitor led to the acquisition of additional genetic changes , rather than reversion back to wildtype , has important implications for treatment strategies to manage resistance . The major take-away of this study is that combination treatment with DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 failed to suppress resistance , and we hypothesize that this is due to the great diversity of evolutionarily competitive dhodh mutations that confer resistance to various inhibitors . We can not quantify the frequency of resistance emergence based on our results , which would be necessary to fully understand the risk of resistance to DSM265 + TCMDC-125334 in combination compared to treating with either compound alone . Similarly , we find that although most of the mutations we originally identified were collaterally sensitive to TCMDC-125334 , repeated treatment with DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 in
[METHODS] Mutant structures were prepared with Flare 's mutate function using default settings , energy minimized with Flare 's protein minimize function in the absence of other molecules and then in the presence of TCMDC-125334 , orotate , and FMN , and then rescored as described above . Parasites were cultured in the presence of test",,995,98,None,"Malaria is a disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum . The parasites infected with this parasite are unable to reproduce , and they are often resistant to antibiotics . However , some of these parasite populations are resistant to drugs , such as artemisinin , which is used to treat malaria . This is because resistance to a drug can lead to bacterial resistance , or a combination of two drugs . One drug , known as TCMDC-125334 , has been shown to be more effective than the other , but it is not clear how this combination works . To address this question , Wei et al . screened a collection of parasite strains that had been resistant to the drug DSM265 . These strains were then compared to the mutants that were resistant to both drugs in vitro and in a mouse model of malaria infection . They found that the mutant strains had a mutation in the gene that encodes a protein called DHODH . In addition , the mutations in the DHDH gene were different from those in the wildtype strains , suggesting that the mutation could be used to suppress the emergence of resistance . Wei also found that some of the mutant parasite lines that had the mutation were more resistant to DSM125334 than others . Further experiments showed that the two drugs worked together to reduce the resistance of the two compounds . Finally , we tested whether the combination of drugs could be exploited to prevent the onset of resistance in the future ."

[ABSTRACT] To address this , we developed a novel compartmental model that tracks sensitive and resistant parasite strains , as well as the host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity . Existing models on resistance evolution lack consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance , possibly due to overlooking the feedback between antigenic diversity , host immunity , and selection for resistance . Our results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency , regardless of resistance cost or efficacy . Though most infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa , resistant strains often emerge in low-transmission regions . Our study underscores the critical role of malaria strain diversity in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution . The establishment and spread of antimalarial drug resistance vary drastically across different biogeographic regions . Post discontinuation of drugs , resistance remains high in low-diversity , low-transmission regions , while it steadily decreases in high-diversity , high-transmission regions . Validation using chloroquine-resistant marker data supports this trend .
[INTRODUCTION] Various relationships between transmission intensity and stable frequencies of resistance were discovered , each of which has some empirical support : ( 1 ) transmission intensity does not influence the fate of resistant genotypes ; ( 2 ) resistance first increases in frequency and slowly decreases with increasing transmission rates ; and ( 3 ) valley phenomenon : resistance can be fixed at both high and low end of transmission intensity . With varying strain diversity , transmission potential , resistance cost , and symptomatic treatment rates , we explore the key questions outlined above : whether strain diversity modulates the equilibrium resistance frequency given different transmission intensities , as well as changes in this frequency after drug withdrawal , and whether the model explains the biogeographic patterns of drug resistance evolution . Our modeling strategy combines the advantages of both the traditional compartmental epidemiological models ( i. e. , tracking transmission dynamics and population immunity responses to different levels of transmission intensity ) and population genetics ones ( i. e. , tracking within-host dynamics with detailed consideration of fitness cost and competition among strains ) . Even though de novo-resistant alleles are constantly generated , widespread resistant strains can almost always be traced back to two unstable transmission regions , that is , Southeast Asia ( especially the Greater Mekong Subregion ) and South America . More interestingly , while in high-transmission regions a steady decrease of resistant genotypes often ensues from reducing the particular drug usage , resistant genotypes are maintained at high frequency in low or unstable transmission regions even after the abandonment of the drug for several decades . While most models have explored factors such as drug usage , treatment rate , vectorial capacity , within-host competition , population immunity , and recombination , strain diversity of parasites has not been explicitly considered in mathematical models of drug resistance . Thus , under the same vectorial capacity , different strain diversity results in significant changes in population-level immunity and transmission intensity , and the ensuing epidemiological patterns , such as MOI , age-prevalence curve , and the ratio of asymptomatic infections . While the frequencies of resistant genotypes often sweep close to fixation in these regions under persistent drug usage , their frequencies are more variable in endemic transmission regions such as sub-Saharan Africa . During the asexual blood stage , intra-erythrocytic parasites express adhesin proteins
[RESULTS] This pattern corroborates similar observations across different biogeographic areas : while the transition of the first-line drug to ACT in Africa , such as Ghana and Kenya , resulted in a fast reduction in resistant genotypes , the reduction was only minor in Oceania , and resistant genotypes are still maintained at almost fixation in Southeast Asia and South America despite the change in the first-line drugs occurring more than 30 y ago ( Figure 8 ) . First , resistant genotypes have a much higher fitness advantage in low-diversity regions even with reduced drug usage because infected hosts are still highly symptomatic ; this trend holds even if diversity is decoupled with transmission potential : given the same transmission potential , high-diversity scenarios have
[DISCUSSION] However , in these models , the infectivity of new bites constrained by antigen diversity is not considered such that under high transmission the clinically immune class still receives numerous new infections , and the lowered symptomatic rate does not offset the amount of drug treatment due to new infections , giving rise to the increasing resistance prevalence at the high end of transmission potential . In our model , we argue that despite the MOI within each G class being Poisson distributed , the population-level MOI distribution is over-dispersed as hosts in the G2 class are much less likely to be infected than in G1 or G0 ( Figure 2-figure supplement 2 ) and hosts in drug-treated classes have lower MOI than untreated classes as they harbor mostly resistant parasites only . In addition , an equal cost in mixed- vs. single-genotype infections also produced a lower frequency of resistance at high transmission in the full model , but not in
[METHODS] This assumption allows us to directly calculate the prevalence ( i. e. , the fraction of individuals carrying at least one infection ) in a given G class i=0 , 1 , 2 and treatment class j=U , D as ( 2 ) Ii , j=1−exp⁡ ( −ri , j ) where r is the mean MOI of the class and is",,945,96,None,"Many malaria parasites are resistant to drugs , but they are also resistant to other drugs . This is because they are more resistant to the drug than the other strains , which means that they are less likely to be able to spread to other areas . The most common type of resistance is malaria , a disease caused by a parasite called chloroquine . However , it is not known how the parasite can spread to different areas , and how this can affect the spread of the disease . To understand how malaria spreads – and how it affects people’s health – we need to understand how the mosquitoes that transmit the disease are adapted to their environment . One way to do this is to look at how the population responds to the effects of a drug . In some areas of the world , the number of parasite-infected people is much higher than in others . For example , in sub-Saharan Africa , there is a high proportion of people who are resistant , while in South America there is only a small proportion of those who are not resistant . These findings suggest that malaria is more resistant in low- and high-diversity areas than in high- and low-transmission regions . But how does this change ? To address this question , Wei et al . developed a new mathematical model that tracks the evolution of malaria resistance . It combines the advantages of both the traditional compartmental epidemiological models and population genetics models , as well as the feedback between antigenic diversity , host immunity , selection for resistance and selection for the resistance , such as the ability to recombinate , to produce new strains of malaria . Our results show that the frequency of resistance increases with increasing transmission intensity , even when the drug is"

[ABSTRACT] A memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile . Here , we leverage a stepwise in vitro differentiation system that captures the early embryonic developmental cascade to investigate the impact of exposure to the most abundant phytocannabinoid , Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ) . We demonstrate that Δ9-THC increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) but not of their primed counterpart . However , while cannabinoid receptors are expressed in the early embryo , the impact of phytocannabinoids exposure on early embryonic processes is lacking . These results represent the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development . Surprisingly , this increased proliferation , dependent on the CB1 receptor binding , is only associated with moderate transcriptomic changes . Instead , Δ9-THC capitalizes on ESCs ' metabolic bivalence by increasing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities . Cannabis , the most consumed illicit psychoactive drug in the world , is increasingly used by pregnant women .
[INTRODUCTION] Differentiation of naïve ESCs into primed PSCs such as epiblast-like cells ( EpiLCs ) is accompanied by an important metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis , in link with a highly proliferative phenotype and a more restricted developmental potential . 6 million people , roughly 18 % of the population , consumed cannabis at least once in 2020 , with indications that these numbers will likely increase in the coming years as attitudes and regulations change . In particular , the extensive metabolic , transcriptional , and epigenetic reprogramming that PGCs undergo during their development has been proposed to be uniquely sensitive to environmental insults , with potential consequences in the offspring . Progressive increase in oxidative phosphorylation correlates with the specification and differentiation from epiblast PSCs towards PGCs , a process that can be replicated in vitro by inducing PGC-like cells ( PGCLCs ) from EpiLCs . While over the last decades , significant attention has been paid to Δ9-THC 's neurological effects , there is also evidence , albeit more limited , of its impact on reproductive functions . Accordingly , cultured pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) exhibiting different developmental potentials are marked by specific metabolic signatures , similar to the ones displayed by their in vivo counterparts in the embryo . The extended developmental potential of mouse ESCs is associated with their metabolic bivalence , as these cells rely on both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation for energy production . Primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) , the embryonic precursors of gametes in metazoans , are considered dormant totipotent cells because they possess the unique ability to reacquire totipotency upon fertilization . The psychoactive effects of Δ9-THC arise from its binding and subsequent activation of the G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor CB1 largely expressed in the central nervous system . We reveal that , in the absence of continuous exposure , metabolic memory of Δ9-THC is passed onto the PGCLCs stage leading to transcriptional defects in these cells . As a result , the level of Δ9-THC in recreational cannabis has increased over the last 10 years and now commonly accounts for 20 % of total compounds . In animal models as well as in humans , exposure to cannabis is associated with reduced fertility , decreased testis weight and sperm count , and impairment of embryo implantation . Despite this accumulating evidence
[RESULTS] Deriving EpiLCs from exposed ESCs and exposing them to Δ9-THC for 48 hr did not significantly affect either their cell number nor their incorporation of BrdU ( Figure 1I and Figure 1J ) , indicating that the increased proliferation observed at the ESCs stage is not carried through the naive-to-prime transition . Volcano plot of DEGs between DP PGCLCs deriving from mock- or 100 nM Δ9-THC-exposed ESCs and EpiLCs revealed that most of the significant transcriptional change was towards downregulation rather than upregulation ( Figure 7E , 11 genes were significantly upregulated whereas 97 were significantly downregulated , |log2 ( fold-change ) | > 0 . Of note , metabolite measurements showed that the ratio of glutathione in its reduced to oxidated
[DISCUSSION] Bioenergetics analyses and metabolite measurements showed that this increased glucose metabolism did not support increased energy production in the mitochondria , but rather , that it led to the accumulation of metabolic intermediates used in anabolic reactions for the synthesis of amino acids , nucleotides , and lipids . Comparing the outputs of the metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses ( i. e. PCA plots and volcano plots ) , the impact of Δ9-THC at these early stages seems to be primarily metabolic , although the moderate effects on the transcriptome appear to support the metabolic outcome as revealed by our integrated analysis ( Figure 5F ) . In particular , exposure to Δ9-THC increased ESC proliferation which was in a similar range to what has been previously reported for human breast carcinoma cell lines ( about 30-50 % between 10 nM and 1 µM of Δ9-THC ) . Using a well-characterized in vitro model of early embryonic differentiation events culminating
[METHODS] Briefly , poly ( A ) RNA were selected , fragmented and double-stranded cDNA synthesized using a mixture of random and oligo ( dT ) priming , followed by end repair to generate blunt ends , adaptor ligation , strand selection , and polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification to produce the final library . For PGCLCs , d5",,957,96,None,"Cannabis is the most widely used drug in the world , and it has been linked to a number of health problems , including cancer , heart disease , diabetes , Alzheimer’s disease . However , it is not clear how cannabis affects the development of embryos . The most common type of stem cell is called primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) , which are the precursors of gametes . These cells are thought to have a unique ability to re-establish their totipotency upon fertilization . They are also known as dormant germ cells because they can produce energy when fertilized . In addition , they can be used as a drug to treat conditions such as cancer or diabetes . One of the main reasons for this is that they are able to produce more energy than other types of stem cells . This means that they can grow faster and produce more cells , but they also have less energy . It has been suggested that cannabis can also cause cancer . But it is unclear how this can affect the growth of these stem cells in the future . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called a stepwise in vitro differentiation system to study the effects of exposure to the most abundant phytocannabinoid , 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (  9-THC ) in mice . Using a mouse model , the experiments show that exposure to this drug increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells but not of their primed counterparts , suggesting that this effect is only associated with moderate changes in their metabolic profile .

[ABSTRACT] In contrast to the massive variability of gene copies , nucleotide diversity in zebrafish NLR genes is very low : around half of the copies are monomorphic and the remaining ones have very few polymorphisms , likely a signature of purifying selection . By sequencing 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations , we identified a total of 1513 NLRs , many more than the previously known 400 . Copy number variation in large gene families is well characterized for plant resistance genes , but similar studies are rare in animals . Approximately half of those are present in all wild populations , but only 4 % were found in 80 % or more of the individual fish . Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population than laboratory strains . The zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) has hundreds of NLR immune genes , making this species ideal for studying this phenomenon .
[INTRODUCTION] Most knowledge about NLRs in animals comes from studies of humans and rodents , but their NLR repertoires ( 20-30 genes ) are smaller than those of many other species such as the purple sea urchin , the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica , and many fish . The majority of fish NLRs represent a fish-specific subtype that was originally labeled NLR-C , although they can be further divided into at least six groups based on structural similarities and sequence of conserved exons . They have a multitude of functions : some act as pathogen sensors or transcription factors , others are components or modulators of inflammasomes , large protein complexes that are assembled within cells as part of the response to biological or chemical danger . Many genes and proteins of the immune system are lineage-specific ( limited to specific groups of animals , plants , or other taxa ) , while others have defense roles in a wide range of species . 2 domain functions through protein-protein interaction and is also found in a variety of other genes such as the large family of TRIM ubiquitin ligases that are often also involved in immunity . The zebrafish reference genome contains nearly 400 NLR genes , two-thirds of which are located on the putative sex chromosome ( chromosome 4 ) , in a genomic region associated with extensive haplotypic variation . A species-wide inventory of major NLR exons in a model species such as zebrafish would provide valuable insights into the evolution and diversity of this large immune gene family . All of them possess a FISNA domain ( fish-specific NACHT-associated domain ) , which precedes the nucleotide-binding domain NACHT and is encoded by the same large exon near the N-terminus of the protein . In animals , these repeats are usually leucine-rich repeats ( LRRs ) and the proteins themselves are classified as NLRs ( nucleotide binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing , also known as NOD-like receptors ) . Plants have their own NLRs that are structurally similar to the ones from animals and also carry out central functions in the immune response . Their diversity has been extensively characterized in several species , including the thale cress ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) , and vastly different repertoires have been found from different strains or individuals . In particular , proteins containing a large nucleotide-binding domain followed by smaller repeats have
[RESULTS] We found each individual zebrafish to have 100-550 NLR genes from the pan-NLRome in at least one copy ( Figures 2 and 3 ) , and only 50-75 % of these have a high-quality match in the GRCz11 reference genome ( Figure 2-figure supplement 2 ) . Furthermore , each NLR had its own distinct pattern of copy number variation , although generally the highest copy numbers were observed for the wild populations KG , SN , and CHT ( Figure 3A ) . Using this function ( see 'Materials and methods ' ) , we estimated the sizes of the NLRomes of the populations ( Figure 3D ) and found a total of 520 and 570 NLRs in the laboratory strains TU and CGN
[DISCUSSION] Since our targeted sequencing approach does not elucidate the genomic arrangement of the NLR gene copies and many of them do not have recognizable orthologs in the reference genome , we can not draw further conclusions about the role of tandem arrays in their evolutionary trajectory . Since there are many transposable elements on the long arm of chromosome 4 , it would be reasonable to assume that at least some of them have assisted in the local expansion and transfer of NLR exons and genes to chromosomes other than chromosome 4 . It is possible that some of them participate in the formation and activity of inflammasomes , but we only found the N-terminal effector domains ( CARD or PYD ) that are typically involved in this function in a small subset of NLR-C genes . If the diversity of unrelated NLR genes in such distantly related species is driven by common molecular mechanisms , then the same mechanisms might also

These proteins are found on the surface of cells , and they help to protect the body from harmful substances . However , many of these proteins are not found in other animals , such as humans and rodents , but they are found in many other species . The zebrafish , for example , has hundreds of NLR genes , which can be found in a wide range of animals . Most of these genes are located on the sex chromosome , where they are known as the “NLR-C” gene . This gene is also known as a “nucleotide-binding domain” ( NACHT ) , or “null-like receptors” ( LRs for short ) that are involved in the immune response to a variety of threats .

[ABSTRACT] It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus , and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with less wings . Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one , two or four wings under the same condition . nov. Each ovule of this taxon possesses three integumentary wings evidently extending outwards , folding inwards along abaxial side and enclosing most part of nucellus . Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal . However , the earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian are rarely known about the dispersal syndrome and usually surrounded by a cupule . From Xinhang , Anhui , China , we now report a new taxon of Famennian ovules , Alasemenia tria gen. et sp . The ovules or seeds ( fertilized ovules ) with wings are widespread and especially important for wind dispersal . The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule .
[INTRODUCTION] Lacking wings as integumentary outgrowths , the earliest ovules in the Famennian ( 372-359 million years ago [ Ma ] , Late Devonian ) rarely played a role in wind dispersal . Based on current fossil evidence and mathematical analysis , we discuss the evolution of winged seeds and compare the wind dispersal of seeds with different number of wings . It occurs in Jianchuan mine of China , where Xinhang fossil forest was discovered to comprise in situ lycopsid trees of Guangdedendron . Since plants colonized the land , wind dispersal ( anemochory ) became common with the seed wing representing a key dispersal strategy through geological history . The terminally borne ovules are three-winged and clearly acupulate , thus implying additional or novel functions of integument . Guazia was a Famennian ovule with four wings and it is terminally borne and acupulate ( devoid of cupule ) . Winged seeds evolved numerous times in many lineages of extinct and extant seed plants ( spermatophytes ) . Warsteinia was a Famennian ovule with four integumentary wings , but its attachment and cupule remain unknown . This paper documents a new Famennian seed plant with ovule , Alasemenia tria gen. et sp .

[RESULTS] The integumentary lobes are narrow , flattened and fused in the lower part of an ovule , and acropetally become wide , thick , separated and far away ( Figure 4c-e , Figure 4-figure supplement 1a-k , Figure 4-figure supplement 2 ) . Some ovules are borne terminally on smooth branches that are thrice ( Figure 1a ) , twice ( Figure 1c ) or once ( Figure 1b , f , g and i , Figure 2a-c ) dichotomous at 40-135° .

[DISCUSSION] In early seed plants , the fertile branches terminated by cupulate ovules consistently lack leaves and thus the cupules probably serve a nutritive function as in photosynthetic organs ; this function may be transferred to the integuments of acupulate ovules such as Guazia . The earliest ovules in the Famennian of Late Devonian , usually preserved to be unconnected with branches , are mostly devoid of integumentary wings and enclosed in cupules ; they are thus insufficiently known for integument function and wind dispersal . As in Alasemenia ( Figure 5a ) , the integumentary wings of acupulate ovule of Guazia are broad , thin and fold inwards along the abaxial side , but their numbers are four in each ovule and their free portions usually arch centripetally . Alasemenia , Guazia , and Warsteinia suggest that the evolutionarily novel wings , as integument outgrowths and the most important mechanism for seed dispersal by wind , appeared early in the spermatophytes and had been manifested in younger lineages .

One of these strategies is called anemochory , which is a process in which the seeds of a plant are swept away by the wind .

The earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian were surrounded by a cupule , a small , round structure that is attached to the plant’s surface . However , the earliest of these wings was not known . Now , Zhang et al . have discovered a new taxon of Famendian ovles , Alasemenia tria . These oveles are a type of seed plant that has wings . They are borne on smooth branches , but they lack a capule and are surrounded with a wing . It is not clear how the worms that carry these wings evolved to be able to fly through the wind and dispersing .

[ABSTRACT] Although standard treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have achieved remarkable success in prolonging patient survival , intolerance , relapse , and TKI resistance remain serious issues for patients with Ph+ leukemia . Collectively , these findings represent an alternative to tyrosine kinase activity for the oncoprotein and leukemogenic cells and generate a rationale of targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia . Moreover , in contrast to in vivo ineffectiveness of PROTAC-based degraders , depletion of RAPSYN expression , or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and , in turn , inhibited tumor formation and growth . Here , we report a new leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia , and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL . Furthermore , SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity , promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression . Consequently , neddylated BCR-ABL enhances the stability by competing its c-CBL-mediated degradation . Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) leukemia is a fatal hematological malignancy .
[INTRODUCTION] As a type of post-translational modification ( PTM ) , neddylation is sequentially catalyzed by the neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 ( NEDD8 ) -activating enzyme E1 ( NAE1 ) , NEDD8-conjugating enzyme E2 ( UBE2M/UBC12 or UBE2F ) , and a substrate-specific NEDD8 E3 ligase to complete the covalent conjugation of NEDD8 to a lysine residue of its substrates . Currently , based on different ubiquitin E3 ligases , including VHL , CRBN , and IAP , PROTAC-based degraders at nM level have shown significant degradation of BCR-ABL in CML cell lines , cell lines carrying mutations in BCR-ABL as well as patient-derived primary cells containing multiple BCR-ABL mutations . Because of its newly identified E3 ligase activity for neddylation and its occurrence in the Ph+ leukemia cell line , we speculated that RAPSYN might contribute to Ph+ leukemia development through its enzymatic activity instead of only serving as a scaffolding protein . In the last two decades , accumulating evidence indicated the strong involvement of dysregulated neddylation in tumor progression , neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases , aberrant immunoregulation and others , which rationalizes the modulation of neddylation as a feasible therapeutic strategy . It is worth noting that the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of TKI resistance in patients with Ph+ leukemia in addition to the mutations in the kinase domain . Despite the extensive studies of RAPSYN in muscular and neuronal cells and tissues , with regard to its involvement in leukemogenesis , there is no available information thus far except for our previous finding . Unfortunately , the excellent cellular activity by the PROTAC-based degraders has not been able to translate to in vivo efficacy , even in rare examples of xenografted mouse models , resulting in uncertain usefulness of these degraders . In this study , we report that RAPSYN is highly expressed along with BCR-ABL in patients with Ph+ leukemia and promotes disease progression , presumably by stabilizing the BCR-ABL fusion protein via neddylation . Previously , RAPSYN was found to be located in the cytosol of the typical Ph+ leukemia cell line K562 when a small molecule was used to probe its binding proteins using a proteomics approach . Therefore , effective degradation of BCR-ABL could address the issues on TKI resistance and leukemia-initiating cells ( LICs ) ,
[RESULTS] Whereas notable cytotoxicity following marked reduction of RAPSYN was observed in all tested Ph+ leukemia cell lines and CML patient PBMCs ( Figure 1C , D , Figure 1-figure supplement 1D-F ) , transduction with the shRNA for RAPSN did not affect cell viability of RAPSYN- and BCR-ABL-negative HS-5 cells , indicating the dependence on the presence and expression level of BCR-ABL . In animal models , while the overall survival of mice intravenously injected with K562 cells expressing control empty vector was significantly improved by either saracatinib administration or shRNA-mediated SRC inhibition , overexpression of WT RAPSN fully counteracted these effects and shortened the lifespan of mice to the levels comparable to those of mice injected with K562 cells without SRC inhibition .
[DISCUSSION] Therefore , rather than suppressing the entire neddylation system to affect a wide range of proteins , targeted inhibition of substrate-specific NEDD8 E3 ligase , such as RAPSYN , might offer a potential therapeutic opportunity for more elegant anticancer intervention with fewer side effects . In summary , our work has uncovered the pivotal role that RAPSYN exerts its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity in neddylating and stabilizing BCR-ABL in the pathogenesis of Ph+ leukemia and thus delineate it as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia . On the other hand , neddylation is a specific PTM that modifies multiple Lys residues in BCR-ABL , shielding this oncoprotein to compete ubiquitination-mediated degradation , which provides a reasonable explanation on the poor in vivo efficacy of PROTAC-based degraders for BCR-ABL . Although recent studies have greatly advanced our understanding of the regulation of BCR-ABL degradation , most reported modulatory proteins are not ideal for translation to clinical settings
[METHODS] K562 , MEG-01 , KU812 , and Jurkat cells were purchased from COBIOER and cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium containing 10-20 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; FS301-02 , TransGen Biotech ) and 100 mg/ml streptomycin/penicillin ( FG101-01 , TransGen Biotech ) . Human peripheral blood samples were obtained from the remaining material utilized for routine laboratory",,946,96,None,"Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people worldwide . It is caused by a mutation in a gene called the Philadelphia chromosome , which is found in many different parts of the body . This mutation causes cells to become more resistant to chemotherapy . However , it is not clear how this mutation affects the development of the disease . In some cases , the disease can be fatal , but it can also lead to severe side effects . For example , some patients with a rare form of leukemia may develop a condition called a leukemic cell . The disease can lead to death if the disease is not treated properly . To treat this condition , tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) are used to treat cancer . These drugs have been shown to be effective in treating cancer , and they have been used to reduce the risk of developing cancer if they are not effective . Now , Wang et al . have used a technique called X-ray crystallography to study the role of a protein called RAPSYN in the formation of the fusion protein BCR-ABL in patients with Philadelphia chromatid leukoma . Using this technique , they found that the protein is highly expressed in the cell and that it is able to stabilize the BCR–ABL fusion molecule . Furthermore , when the protein was degraded , this boosted the stability of the protein . Therefore , these findings provide a new way to treat the disease in patients ."

[ABSTRACT] We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8 , PHAb10 , and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition , while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer . Among them , PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr , while the other three were thermosensitive . Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases ( i. e. lysins ) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development . As a proof-of-concept , five peptidoglycan hydrolases from the Acinetobacter baumannii proteome ( PHAb7-PHAb11 ) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template . Herein , we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening . In conclusion , our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs . The discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes . Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10 .
[INTRODUCTION] For instance , Artilysins are constructed by fusion of cationic nonapeptides to effectively eradicate resistant and persistent A. baumannii ; Innolysins are engineered by fusion of receptor-binding proteins to display bactericidal activity against E. coli that was resistant to third-generation cephalosporins ; bioengineered lysin-bacteriocin fusion molecule , i. e. , Lysocins , are able to deliver lysin across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and show selective anti-Pseudomonal activity . In addition , the establishment of high-throughput mining or engineering strategies has accelerated the discovery of active lysins against Gram-negative pathogens , e. g. , the VersaTile-driven platform , which can rapidly screen engineered lysins active against A. baumannii from tens of thousands of combinations by integrating new DNA assembly methods and iterative screening procedures . Although not yet tested extensively , recent progress in lysins targeting Gram-negative bacteria have demonstrated a clue linking antibacterial activity to their internal antimicrobial peptides , by which lysins cross the bacterial outer membrane and contact its underlying peptidoglycan substrates . This observation supports our hypothesis that antimicrobial peptide-primed mining strategy is feasible for discovering new peptidoglycan hydrolases with high bactericidal activity and desirable physicochemical properties from bacterial proteomes . However , compared with the current progress in the clinical translation of lysins against Gram-positive bacteria , the discovery of lysins against Gram-negative bacteria that meet the needs described in the WHO priority pathogen list is still urgently needed . For example , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , vancomycin-resistant S. aureus , vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus , colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae , third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae , carbapenem-resistant E. coli , K. pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii pose a serious threat and are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in human infectious diseases . Two of them ( PHAb10 and PHAb11 ) were found to be hyperthermally stable even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr , which is mediated by a unique monomer-dimer swapping . These observations prompted us to consider whether antibacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases or their homologs could be mined from bacterial proteomes using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide as template . As a proof-of-concept , we here used the antimicrobial peptide P307 derived from PlyF307 lysin as a template to search for peptidoglycan hydrolases from the A. baumannii proteome database ( PHAbs , Figure 1-figure supplement 1 ) . In recent years ,
[RESULTS] To examine whether it is the reason for the killing ability of PHAb10 and PHAb11 against Gram-negative bacteria , we further analyzed in silico the physicochemical properties of these putative cationic peptides harbored by these two enzymes and found that all three peptides , i. e. , P10-CP , P11-CP , and P11-NP might act as antimicrobial peptides ( Supplementary file 1a ) . Due to the high similarity of amino acid sequences within each clade , we selected a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase from each clade for further characterization by analyzing the selectivity priority in evolution and the overall physicochemical properties ( water solubility , hydrophilicity , hydrophobicity , charge , flexibility , and rigidity ) of each sequence in silico .
[DISCUSSION] Due to their C-terminal antimicrobial peptides P10-CP and P11-CP , PHAb10 and PHAb11 can penetrate the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria in a self-primed manner , allowing them to enter and cleave peptidoglycan bonds , ultimately leading to osmotic lysis of Gram-negative pathogens , while Gram-positive bacteria are killed mainly through the action of the intrinsic antimicrobial peptides . Over billions of years of coevolution , more than 80 % of bacterial genomes have become populated with at least one prophage , also known as molecular imprints , and which can serve as an untapped arsenal for the discovery of phage-related antimicrobial agents . Structure-based homology analysis revealed that PHAb10 and PHAb11 probably belonged to the T4 lysozyme family and possessed the conserved Glu-Asp-Thr catalytic triad shared by traditional phage lysins and bacterial autolysins , namely Glu17 , Asp26 , and Thr32 of PHAb10 , and Glu52 , Asp61 , and Thr67 of PHAb11 . It is known that
[METHODS] To measure the effects of different environmental factors on the antibacterial activity of PHAb10 and PHAb11 , exponential A. baumannii 3437 cells were treated with 50 μg/ml of each peptidoglycan hydrolase at different pH values ( 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 ) , various temperatures ( 4°C , 25°C , 37°C , 45°C",,952,96,None,"Bacteria are able to produce peptidoglycan hydrolases ( lysins ) , which can be used to kill bacteria . These enzymes are made from a protein called a phage , and they are often used to treat infections . However , it is not clear how these enzymes work . One way to find these enzyme molecules is to use a technique called peptide-primed screening . This method involves removing the bacterial genome from the bacteria and then using a computer to search for the enzymes . Then , a machine called VersaTile is used to screen the peptidomes of bacteria , including bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and other drugs . It is also possible to extract a small amount of the enzyme from the DNA of the bacteria to make a new enzyme . To do this , researchers need to find a large number of lyses that are active against the bacteria that they are trying to kill . For example , one enzyme called PHAb10 was found in the genome of Acinetobacter baumannii , but it was not known how it was made . Now , Wang et al . have developed a strategy to mine the enzyme , using phagosomes , from bacteria that have been resistant to conventional antibiotics for a long time . They then used a method called lySeq , to screen for enzymes that could be active against bacteria if they were unable to produce the enzyme themselves . PH Abs10 was also found in bacteria that were resistant to a variety of drugs , such as cephalosporins and carbapenem . In addition , they were found in mice that had been infected with a different type of"

[ABSTRACT] These results provide a comprehensive comparison of the two types of pancreatic cancer symptom trajectories , which in combination can leverage the full potential of the health data and ultimately provide a fuller picture for detection of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer . Chaining symptoms together in trajectories identified two groups of patients with lower median survival ( < 90 days ) following the trajectories 'Cough→Jaundice→Intestinal obstruction ' and 'Pain→Jaundice→Abnormal results of function studies ' . To complement and compare the registry diagnosis codes with deeper clinical data , we used a text mining approach to extract symptoms from free text clinical notes in electronic health records . We used both data sources to generate and compare symptom disease trajectories to uncover temporal patterns of symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis for the same patients . We show that the text mining of the clinical notes was able to complement the registry-based symptoms by capturing more symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis . In this retrospective study , we used symptom and disease codes ( ICD-10 ) from the Danish National Patient Registry ( NPR ) encompassing 6 . For example , 'Blood pressure reading without diagnosis ' , 'Abnormalities of heartbeat ' , and 'Intestinal obstruction ' were not found for the registry-based analysis . 9 million patients from 1994 to 2018 , , of whom 23 , 592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer . Better detection of early symptoms and relevant disease correlations could improve pancreatic cancer prognosis . Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancer types with poor treatment options . The Danish cancer registry included 18 , 523 of these patients .
[INTRODUCTION] The National Danish Patient Registry ( NPR ) contains hospital diagnoses since 1977 and allows for large data-driven studies to detect temporal disease progression patterns relevant in the context of stratified medicine . Hence , improved knowledge of symptoms and diseases occurring early is of high importance to treat this cancer type at a curable stage and provide better prognosis and guide screening programs for pancreatic cancer . A prospective study investigating initial symptoms and diagnostic interval ( time from onset to diagnosis ) for known pancreatic cancer symptoms found no difference between pancreatic cancer patients and patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer . Other studies used primary care EHRs to detect pancreatic cancer symptoms and found jaundice , back pain , lethargy , and new-onset diabetes to be linked to pancreatic cancer . We generate and compare disease and symptom trajectories using registry data and clinical notes in EHRs to characterize the temporal ordering of symptoms across data sources . A small-scale study using 4080 mixed types of cancers attempted to build more general 'event trajectories ' using text mining and pooled analysis . If the cancer is detected at an early stage , where surgical removal of the tumour is possible , the survival rate increases to 42 % . The registries in the Nordic countries are of high quality and among the oldest covering treatment in one-payer health care systems . New-onset diabetes has additionally been found to co-occur with pancreatic cancer when accompanied by weight loss . It has few and generic symptoms resulting in late diagnosis and poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 11 % . These studies detected pancreatic cancer symptoms using a single-disease approach , not considering the temporal ordering of symptoms or diseases . Recent examples are the characterization of multimorbidity correlations across cancer types and the detection of pancreatic cancer using artificial intelligence . Pancreatic cancer has been predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer deaths , surpassing breast , colorectal , and prostate cancer . It has also been suggested that symptoms appear sporadically , adding to the complex nature of the disease manifestation . Symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often
[RESULTS] Most of the codes from the symptoms chapter appear after the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer , such as 'General disability ' , 'Malaise and fatigue ' , and 'Cachexia ' , whereas fewer symptoms are found prior to the cancer such as 'Jaundice ' , 'Haemorrhage ' , and 'Pain ' ( throat , chest , abdomen , and pelvis ; Figure 3A ) . From these , 25 , 085 patients ( 82 % ) had a match for at least one symptom from a general symptom dictionary generated by combining general symptoms from the ( 1 ) ICD-10 chapter 18 , ( 2 ) known pancreatic cancer symptoms from the literature ,
[DISCUSSION] Furthermore , our study reveals a notable increase in the prevalence of early symptoms within EHRs suggesting the possibility of harnessing the complete potential of health data by incorporating multi-modality symptom trajectories derived from both EHRs and registry-based codes . In this type of trajectory study , we can only assess the association between diseases , but actual causal relationships will need to be validated by other types of studies , such as Mendelian randomization using genetics . Future applications could leverage this knowledge and use AI and advanced text mining techniques to build longitudinal multi-modal trajectories for improved symptom extraction and early prediction of pancreatic cancer in the clinics . For example , more than 2000 patients out of 3078 text-mined pancreatic cancer cases had 'Pain ' according to the free text clinical notes but in the registry , it was less than 500 patients out
[METHODS] Specificity is the fraction of correctly matched words that are not symptoms opposed to all the non-symptom words in the clinical notes and is defined by , ( 2 ) Specificity=TNTN+FP We calculated significant disease trajectories for the population of pancreatic cancer patients using the methodology from Jensen et al. , 2014 . Status codes 01",,991,98,None,"Pancreatic cancer is the most common type of cancer in the world . It is caused by a tumour in the pancreas , which can grow and spread . The disease can be fatal if left untreated , and it can lead to death if it is not treated properly . However , there are many different types of cancer , such as breast , colorectal and prostate cancer . One of the main causes of cancer is that it can be difficult to treat . This is because the disease can spread to other parts of the body , including the liver , kidneys and the intestine . In some cases , it can cause serious health problems . For example , if the cancer is detected at an early stage , where surgery is possible , the survival rate increases to 42% . But it is also possible to treat the disease at a later stage . To do this , researchers need to know how the disease progresses and how it affects the patient’s health . A large number of studies have looked at the symptoms of the disease in the Danish National Patient Registry ( NPR ) . These studies used data from the NPR to identify symptoms and disease codes . They found that patients with the symptoms code had lower survival rates than those without symptoms . Moreover , patients with symptoms coded for the disease code were more likely to die . Further studies have shown that patients who had symptoms codes for the same disease code had a lower survival rate than patients who did not have symptoms codes themselves . Overall , these studies show that better detection of symptoms and related disease correlations could improve the prognosis of this type of disease . If the disease is detected early , when it is possible to remove the tumour , then the disease will be treated ."

[ABSTRACT] Leveraging individualized detection of single events , we first provide a detailed cross-sectional characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles , slow oscillations , and their coupling in children and adolescents aged 5-6 , 8-11 , and 14-18 years , and an adult sample of 20- to 26-year-olds . To corroborate these findings , we linked personalized measures of fast spindle maturity , which indicate the similarity between the prevailing development-specific and adult-like canonical fast spindles , and slow oscillation maturity , which reflects the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance , with individual slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns . While the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in that it was still nested in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range for the majority of children , the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the adult-like canonical fast spindle range in all four age groups-but notably less precise in children . Taken together , our results suggest that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles actuates precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood . Importantly , we found that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups . Critically , based on this , we then investigated how spindle and slow oscillation maturity substantiate age-related differences in their precise orchestration . However , there is little knowledge on how this well-known coalescence between slow oscillations and sleep spindles develops . 5-1 Hz ) up peak is considered an essential feature of adult non-rapid eye movement sleep . The synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindle activity ( 12 . 5-16 Hz , adult-like ) precisely during the slow oscillation ( 0 .
[INTRODUCTION] The grouping of sleep spindles into sequences of increased and decreased activity by the sleep slow oscillation during non-rapid eye movement sleep ( NREM ) has been recognized as an intrinsic property of the healthy , mature mammalian corticothalamic system for decades . Taken together , the complex wave sequence of SO up state and canonical fast sleep spindles , together with hippocampal activity , is considered to provide the scaffold for the precisely timed reactivation of initially fragile hippocampal memory representations and their strengthening in neocortical networks . Far from being an epiphenomenon , accumulating evidence suggests that the synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindles precisely during the up state of SOs provides an essential mechanism for neural communication , for example , supporting systems memory consolidation during sleep . For this , we re-analyzed previously published nocturnal EEG data from a cross-sectional sample of 24 5- to 6-year-old children and a longitudinal cohort of 33 children tested at 8-11 years of age and again at 14-18 years of age . Individualized rhythm detection methods provide an effective approach to capture true , dominant oscillatory rhythms despite substantial inter-individual variability , which presents a particular methodological challenge in developmental and age-comparative research . However , amongst others , the application of individually adjusted frequency bands revealed that already young children express functional fast spindles in centro-parietal sites , whereby these manifest in a development-specific fashion . Nevertheless , it is still unclear how developments in sleep spindles and SOs interact to promote precise , adult-like temporal synchronization of sleep spindles during SOs across childhood and adolescence . However , the precise coupling of sleep spindle activity to SOs , described above , does not seem to be fully present and functional from early childhood on . Therefore , we aimed to ( i ) characterize the modulation of sleep spindles during SOs across different ages and ( ii ) investigate how sleep spindle and SO maturity relate to the manifestation of SO-spindle coupling across different ages . The joint depolarization of large groups of cortical neurons during the SO up state impinges on neurons of the
[RESULTS] To obtain evidence for two distinct dominant oscillatory spindle rhythms within all four age groups ( 5- to 6- , 8- to 11- , 14- to 18- , 20- to 26-year-olds ) , we firstly determined individual spindle peak frequencies ( between 9-16 Hz ) of background-corrected power spectra during non-rapid eye movement sleep ( NREM , N2 and N3 ) at averaged frontal ( F3 , F4 ) and centro-parietal ( C3 , C4 , Cz , Pz ) electrodes , where slow and fast sleep spindles typically dominate , respectively . Similar to the analyses on sleep spindles , we next compared features that define SOs ( i. e.
[DISCUSSION] Hence , our findings represent a promising starting point for future research addressing the precise relation between age-related changes in brain structure and function , the emergence of adult-like SO-spindle coupling , and cognitive development across childhood and adolescence . While SOs provide optimal time windows for sleep spindles to arise , it is the ability to generate adult-like , canonical fast spindles that determines coupling strength and precision across child and adolescent development . Given the evidence for its generating role , our results implicate the maturation of specific thalamocortical circuits as the cornerstone of adult-like SO-spindle coupling patterns . Overall , our findings describe a unique relation between fast sleep spindle maturity and the pattern of SO-spindle coupling across childhood , adolescence , and young adulthood .
[METHODS] Two adolescents had to be excluded due to technical problems during PSG and data of one participant was not further analyzed because of insufficient amounts of NREM sleep stage 3 ( N3 ; out of four nights , in only two nights N3 sleep was detected ; together : 3 . While the first night",,982,97,None,"Sleeping is a sleep-like activity that occurs during sleep . The brain processes information about the body’s movements in order to make decisions . This information is then relayed to the brain via the brain’s memory processing system , called the corticothalamus . When the brain is awake , the brain sends messages to the cortical regions of the brain called the hippocampus , which are responsible for remembering and remembering information . However , it is not clear how the brain communicates with these regions . For example , when the brain receives information from the brain , a signal called the sleep slow oscillation occurs . It is thought that this signal is synchronized with the sleep fast oscillation , but it is unclear how this happens . To address this question , Wang et al . used a technique called individualized EEG to study the sleep spindle activity in children and adolescents aged 5–6 , 8–11 , and 14–18 years . In the experiments , they measured the activity of the sleep short oscillations in the brains of 24 children and an adult sample of 20–26 years of age . They found that the sleep long oscillation was more precise in children than in adults , suggesting that the brain has evolved to produce a more precise sleep fast rhythm .

[ABSTRACT] Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect which genes are being studied , we find that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies . To promote the investigation of understudied genes , we condense our insights into a tool , find my understudied genes ( FMUG ) , that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits . These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput technologies , which routinely identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease . Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results . Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of genes as research targets have been proposed , their explanatory powers have not yet been compared . Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 . We demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging . Conversely , we find that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations . Understudied genes remain abandoned by studies that cite these -omics experiments . FMUG is developed in Flutter and is available for download at fmug . edu as a MacOS/Windows app . amaral . northwestern .
[INTRODUCTION] For determining which gene properties were associated with selection as research targets , we synthesized quantitative measures from a variety of authoritative sources ( see Materials and methods ) . As a surrogate for a given gene having been investigated closer , we consider whether it was reported in the title or abstract of a research article . We determined which genes were mentioned in the title or abstract of articles using annotations from gene2pubmed and PubTator . We denote genes that are found to have statistically significant changes in expression or associations with a phenotype as 'hit ' genes . We considered 450 genome-wide association studies , 296 studies using affinity purification-mass spectrometry , 148 transcriptomic studies , and 15 genome-wide screens using CRISPR ( see PRISMA diagrams in Figure 1-figure supplement 1 , Figure 1-figure supplement 2 , Figure 1-figure supplement 3 , and Figure 1-figure supplement 4 ) . We used NIH iCite v32 for citations .
[RESULTS] These are : experts ' tendency to deepen their expertise , a perceived lack of accuracy of -omics studies , -omics serving research purposes beyond target gene identification , the absence of good protocols for mass spectrometry , the electronic distribution and reading of research articles , rates of reproducibility , career prospects of investigators , authors beginning manuscripts with something familiar before introducing something new , and the human tendency to fall back to simplifying heuristics when making decisions under conditions with uncertainty . As any of these factors could plausibly affect gene selection within individual domains of biomedical research , we returned to the -omics data described above ( Figure 1B ) and measured how much these factors align with the selective highlighting of hit genes in the title or abstract
[DISCUSSION] We believe that enabling scientists to consciously engage with bias in research target selection will enable more biomedical researchers to participate in unknomics , to the potential benefit of their own research impact and toward the advancement of our collective understanding of the entire human genome . As our present analysis is correlative , it also is tempting to propose controlled trials where published manuscripts on high-throughput studies randomly report hit genes in the abstract even if not investigated further by the authors . The insight that understudied genes are lost to titles and abstracts of research articles in a leaky pipeline between genome-wide assays and reporting of results , and FMUG , have already been useful in guiding our own unknomics research ( Figure 4B ) . Efforts to address the gaps in detailed knowledge about most genes have crystallized as initiatives promoting the investigation of understudied sets of genes , an approach to gene scholarship recently termed 'unknomics ' . Further , the observed discrepancy between the popularity of hits highlighted
[METHODS] Any interactions involving a human gene as the prey protein with an experimental evidence code of 'Affinity Capture-MS ' labeled as 'High-Throughput ' that had an associated PubMed ID in which hit genes were mentioned in the title or abstract was considered ( n=296 ) . Although this does not necessarily reflect whether the mapped genes were claimed directly by the patent holder , as noted",,806,89,None,"Most of the genes in the human genome are found in a wide variety of publications , including the Human Genome Project ( HGP ) . However , many of these genes are not well understood . For example , some of the genetic information about a gene is not known , and it is difficult to understand how it was discovered . The HGP has been used to identify genes that are not known to be involved in disease , such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s Disease . In addition , the HGP is used to find new genes that may be important for the development of new treatments . Many of these new genes have been found to be associated with diseases , but they have not been identified in the literature . To address this problem , researchers have developed a tool called FMUG , which allows them to identify understudied genes . FMUG is available for download on MacOS and Windows . It is a free app that can be downloaded from the Apple App Store . Researchers can then use FMUG to find genes that have been identified previously , or to identify those that have not yet been identified . This will allow researchers to focus their research on the genes that might be important to disease . Previous studies have suggested that the selection of genes for research targets could be biased . But it is not clear how this bias is reflected in the results of these studies . Now , Liu et al . have developed FMUG as a software tool that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection process . They found that 33 genes were significantly associated with the choice of genes presented in the title or abstract of a research article . These genes were found to have statistically significant changes in expression or associations with a phenotype . Furthermore , these genes were reported in the abstract of an article , suggesting that"

[ABSTRACT] We have established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose , resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) . Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of the ECs in the embryos exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs , proliferating ECs , and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes . Further analysis and experiments validated that reduced foxo1a mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of marcksl1a . Utilizing this model , we observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels , especially intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ) . This study has provided new evidence showing the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms . The excessively branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into tip cells . Nevertheless , the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood . Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides were suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages .
[INTRODUCTION] The epidemiological evidence has indicated the positive correlation between risks of cardiovascular disease and DM with the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSBs ) and 100 % fruit juices , thereby emphasizing the concerns for the adverse effects of sugar intake on cardiometabolic risk factors , regardless of whether the sugar is added or naturally occurring . The zebrafish has been recognized as a valuable animal model for studying metabolic diseases , such as hyperglycemia and diabetic complications , due to its functional conservation in glycol metabolism , pancreas structure , glucose homeostasis , adipose biology , and genetic similarities to mammals . Here , we have successfully established a short-term zebrafish model that exhibits significantly excessive angiogenesis similar to the phenotypes observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) induced by glucose treatment . The combination of embryonic transparency and transgenic lines , wherein endothelial cells are labeled specifically with fluorescent proteins , facilitates the high-resolution imaging analysis of vascular formation in vivo . The harmful effects of hyperglycemia are closely associated with both microvascular and macrovascular complications , including retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy , atherosclerosis , ischemic heart disease , stroke , and peripheral artery disease . Among patients with DM , cardiovascular complications , especially the direct and indirect effects of hyperglycemia on the human vascular network , persist as the primary cause of morbidity and mortality . However , accumulating studies in the last decade suggested that ASB consumption might be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes . High blood glucose levels over long periods have been demonstrated to be associated with vascular dysfunction both in vivo and in vitro . Artificially sweetened beverages ( ASBs ) , which incorporate noncaloric sweeteners or low-caloric additives , have been suggested as healthy alternatives to SSBs . Endothelial cell dysfunction is a systemic pathological state exhibiting disrupted integrity , adhesion , altered proliferation capacity , migration , tube formation , and more . Using this model , we examined the effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel development and investigated the molecular mechanisms . However , the association between noncaloric monosaccharides and vascular dysfunctions , such as excessive angiogenesis , has not been elucidated . Our results provided new evidence for the negative roles of caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides on vascular development . Several recent studies have
[RESULTS] Multiple criteria were applied to select the single cells , including the retention of the genes that were expressed ( Unique Molecular Identifiers or UMI larger than 0 ) in at least three individual cells , the selection of cells with the gene expression count falling within the range of 500-3000 , and the imposition of a threshold wherein the proportion of sequencing reads derived from the mitochondrial genome was limited to less than 5 % ( Figure 4-figure supplement 1 , Figure 4-figure supplement 2 , Supplementary file 1 ) . To establish the short-term zebrafish hyperangiogenenic model induced by high glucose treatment , we immersed the Tg ( fli1aEP : EGFP-CAAX ) ntu666 embryos , a transgenic line wherein the endothelial
[DISCUSSION] Since excessive angiogenesis is the major pathological feature of DR and nephropathy , our findings are in support of a possible biological mechanism underlying the positive associations between noncaloric monosaccharides and microvascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes , suggesting that the noncaloric monosaccharides might not be suitable for ASB consumption . have observed the hyperbranching of small vessel structures originating from the upper part of ISVs , growing horizontally toward and partially connecting to the neighboring ISVs field , the angiogenic sprouts did not form a more complex structure that was observed in our research . In recent years , positive associations between ASB and cardiovascular disease have been proposed , possibly due to several plausible factors , including the potential impact of ASBs on central nervous system circuits , gut hormone secretion , and gut microbiota . Here , by combining the single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data analysis and experimental validation , we identified the transcription factor Foxo1a
[METHODS] Several criteria were applied to select the single cells , including only keeping the genes that are expressed ( UMI larger than 0 ) at least in three single cells , selecting single cells with the number of expressed genes at the range between 500 and 3000 , and requiring the percentage of sequencing reads on mitochondrial genome being less than",,953,96,None,"The blood vessels in the body are made up of cells called endothelial cells . These cells are responsible for supplying oxygen and nutrients to the body , and they are also responsible for the formation of blood vessels . However , it is not clear how these cells work . The zebrafish is a model animal that can be used to study metabolic diseases , such as diabetes and hyperglycemia . It has been shown that high blood sugar levels can cause blood vessels to become excessively branched . This is because the blood vessels are made of a variety of sugars , including sugar-sweetened beverages ( ASBs ) . Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric sweeteners have been suggested as healthier alternatives to sugary drinks . In this study , Wei et al . used a zebrette to study the effects of sugar on blood vessel development in a short-term model of diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) in which the cells were exposed to high levels of sugar . Using this model , we found that the cells in the embryos were more active when glucose was added to the blood , whereas the cells that were not exposed to glucose were more activating . Further experiments showed that the activity of these cells increased when the glucose levels were higher . Our results suggest that artificially sweetened beverages may be a healthier alternative for patients with diabetes , as they are more likely to be harmful to their health ."

[ABSTRACT] Our findings suggest that a shared common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay , together facilitating efficient information organization in WM . Here , participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and later reproduced the full color and location sequences one after another . Daily experiences often involve the processing of multiple sequences , yet storing them challenges the limited capacity of working memory ( WM ) . Second , sequences with consistent trajectories show neural reactivation of common trajectories , and display spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations . First , sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrate improved memory performance and a trajectory correlation between reproduced color and location sequences . To achieve efficient memory storage , relational structures shared by sequences would be leveraged to reorganize and compress information . Crucially , we manipulated the consistency between location and color sequence trajectories . Finally , neural reactivation correlates with WM behavior .
[INTRODUCTION] Meanwhile , in daily experiences , memorized items do not exist independently but are always part of a common framework or share the same structure , which could be leveraged to compress information and overcome the WM capacity challenge . They were first identified as representations of physical maps during navigation , but recently have been shown to also support other higher-level processes , such as conceptual knowledge , reasoning , planning , and decision-making . In other words , subjects need to retain in WM two sequences of features , i. e. , color and location , both of which could be characterized as sequence trajectories along their respective rings on a spatial map . To address this question , participants were asked to memorize a color sequence presented at a list of spatial locations and later reproduce both the color and location sequences on two rings , one after another . Specifically , for the aligned condition , the color and location sequence share a common spatial trajectory , i. e. , separated by the same distance between successive items between maps ( Figure 1B ) , whereas , for the misaligned condition , they have distinct relative trajectories ( Figure 1C ) . In line with the view , conjoined cognitive maps have been recently revealed in the rodent hippocampus ( i. e. physical space and abstract task variables ) , and alignment of different feature maps speeds learning performance . Neural replay , the rapid item-by-item reactivation in a forward or backward direction , is posited to not only repeat past experiences , but also reflect an internal model of the world . Moreover , both spatial and conceptual distances are relied on to generalize when searching for correlated rewards in value-guided learning , supporting a cognitive-map-dependent computational mechanism . We hypothesize that humans would spontaneously combine the structure shared by the two sequences to facilitate memory formation , even though it is unsupervised and non-mandatory . A well-known feature of working memory ( WM ) is its limited capacity , which constrains the amount of information that can be temporarily retained for future behavior . Accordingly , many higher-level processes could be described as mental explorations of a sequence of states within an abstract map , similar to tracing a route on a physical map . For example , while shopping at a supermarket ,
[RESULTS] Therefore , based on the average of trajectory neural representation ( first-second and second-third trajectories ) during presentation of the third item when common trajectory reactivation was observed , we divided all participants into two groups , and observed higher trajectory representation group was accompanied with clearer forward replay ( see Figure 4-figure supplement 2 ) . We are particularly interested in the 'recall location ' period , during which subjects need to remain still without making motor responses but at the same time prepare for subsequent location recall ( see Figure 1A , and upper panel of Figure 4 ) . Overall , behavioral findings demonstrate an improvement in WM performance with a common trajectory across feature domains , and indicate that the
[DISCUSSION] The results also exclude other interpretations , such as motor preparation , eye movements , attentional sampling , sequential rehearsal , etc. , since if that is the case , we would expect a similar neural replay profile for location sequences that are to be serially recalled soon . In the current design , as we specifically manipulate the consistency of spatial trajectory distance between color and location sequences defined in a spatial map , cognitive map might be a more conservative term to frame our findings , although in essence it reflects general schema-based WM reorganization . In this work , we provide behavioral and neural evidence that structure is not only dissociated from content representation , i. e. , factorization coding , but also can be aligned in a spontaneous manner , i. e. , linking structures , which together contribute to efficient representation of memory information . In fact , cognitive map refers to the internal representation of spatial
[METHODS] Note that the following decoding approach was based on the whole electrodes , except that location decoding in the encoding period was based on the posterior electrodes ( P7 , P5 , P3 , P1 , Pz , P4 , P6 , P8 , PO7 , PO3 , POz , PO4 , PO8 , O1 , Oz , and O2 )",,942,95,None,"In order to learn new skills , we need to remember a large number of items . For example , if we are going to buy a new car , the first thing we need is to remember the location of the car . Then , when we are driving , our brain processes all of the information that we have memorized , including the color and location of each item . However , it is not clear how this process works . It has been suggested that , in order to be able to remember multiple items , people need to memorize two sequences of features , each of which can be represented on a map of the world . To do this , participants must memorize a sequence of items with different colors and locations , and then repeat them one after another . This process is called working memory , which is the process of storing and reorganizing information . In this study , researchers asked participants to remember an item with two different colors , one of which was presented at a list of locations and one with a different location . During this process , they were asked to memorise the entire sequence of objects , but also to repeat the whole sequence . These results suggest that the brain uses a common structure to store information , such as a structure that is shared between the two sequence trajectories , to reorganise and compress the information in the brain . Finally , these findings suggest that humans would spontaneously combine the structure shared by the three sequences to facilitate memory formation , even though it is unsupervised and non-mandatory ."

[ABSTRACT] We also solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements . The observed unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity of PURA indicated that this protein is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity . In contrast to several other monogenetic disorders , almost all reported mutations in this nucleic acid-binding protein result in the full disease penetrance . It offers an explanation why even conservative mutations across PURA result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome . In this study , we observed that patient mutations across PURA impair its previously reported co-localization with processing bodies . These mutations either destroyed the folding integrity , RNA binding , or dimerization of PURA . Mutations in the human PURA gene cause the neurodevelopmental PURA syndrome .
[INTRODUCTION] When studying the impact of patient mutations on PURA 's subcellular localization , we observed impaired processing body ( P-body ) association but close-to normal localization to stress granules , indicating a potential importance of P-bodies for PURA syndrome pathology . Based on the crystal structures of PURA from Drosophila melanogaster ( dmPURA ) , three conserved sequence regions termed PUR repeats I , II , and III were identified to fold into globular domains . Whereas PUR repeat I and II assemble into an N-terminal PUR domain via intramolecular interactions , two C-terminal PUR repeats III from different molecules interact with each other and thus mediate dimerization of PURA . Accordingly , PURA has been implicated as a modulator of neurodegenerative disorders , such as fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome ( FXTAS ) , and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorder . In a previous study , homology models based on the dmPURA crystal structures were used to predict in silico the effects of PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the structural integrity of the human PURA protein . Surprisingly , in contrast to phenotypically related genetic diseases such as the Rett syndrome , no hot-spot regions could be identified in the protein sequence that trigger the PURA syndrome . All these PUR domains belong to the class of the PC4-like protein family , which mainly bind single-stranded nucleic acids and can unwind double-stranded DNA and RNA . In summary , we provide a structure-based explanation for the underrepresentation of genetic variations with mild symptoms in patients and a rational approach for predicting and functionally testing genetic variations of uncertain significance . Although both PUR domains possess the typical PC4-like β-β-β-β-α- ( linker ) -β-β-β-β-α topology , the N-terminal domain has been suggested to be the main RNA/DNA interaction entity . Hallmarks of this so-called PURA syndrome are developmental delay , moderate to severe intellectual disability , hypotonia , epileptic seizures , and feeding difficulties , among others . In this study , we experimentally assessed the structure and function of human PURA as well as the impact of representative PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the protein 's integrity . It is ubiquitously expressed and has been implicated in several cellular processes , including transcriptional and translational gene regulation as well as mRNA transport in neurons . With the exception of the unstructured N-terminal region and the very C-terminus , almost all mutations across the
[RESULTS] To analyze whether the afore-mentioned patient-related genetic variations affect the localization of hsPURA to stress granules , the mutant and wild-type versions of full-length FLAG-tagged hsPURA were overexpressed in HeLa cells using a doxycycline-inducible expression cassette and cells were stressed for 1 hr with 500 µM sodium arsenite ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1 and Figure 1B ) . To find out whether stress-granule localization of hsPURA depends on its nucleic acid-binding properties , we also utilized an RNA-binding-deficient version of hsPURA bearing 11 structure-guided point mutations ( m11 ) as a control ( for rationale and design of this mutant , see Figure 1-figure supplement 2 ) . Even after extensive optimization , recombinantly expressed hsPURA fragments with the mutations R199P and I206F ( full-length variant and
[DISCUSSION] To understand how genetic variations causing PUR syndrome affect the subcellular localization of hsPURA , we performed immunofluorescence microscopic analyses in HeLa cells by overexpressing full-length hsPURA as well as disease-causing variants in each of the three PUR repeats , that is K97E , I206F , and F233del . Despite these considerable structural changes , the NMR data also confirmed that the K97E-variant protein remains folded in solution and indicates that PUR domains may be able to partially compensate for mutations by folding promiscuity . Based on the crystal structures of hsPURA III ( Figure 3A ) , we were able to predict folding defects in the C-terminal PUR domain ( hsPUR III ) that are caused by the patient-derived genetic variations F233del and R245P ( Figure 3-figure supplement 4 ) . Our findings suggest that the flexibility and promiscuity of hsPURA domain folding render this protein particularly susceptible to mutations , even when amino-acid substitutions impose only moderate changes to the local charge

In this study , Wei et al . used a technique called molecular dynamics simulations to study the structure and function of the human PI2 gene . The experiments show that the PI1 gene is highly susceptible to mutations , but that the protein is not able to fold properly . To test this hypothesis , we used the same technique as we used to study a similar protein in fruit flies . We found that all of the mutations in PI3 cause the protein to fold poorly . However , the protein was not unable to fold correctly , so we were unable or unwilling to test the protein's structural integrity . Our results suggest that the structure , function and structure of this protein are not well understood ."

[ABSTRACT] Sweating could be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads , and this possibility is supported by the finding that wild-type mice climbed up a slippery slope more easily than TRPV4-deficient mice . Collectively , TRPV4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1 , and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4/ANO 1 complex would be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration . Reports indicate that an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 ( ANO1 ) could be widely involved in water efflux of exocrine glands , suggesting that the interaction could play a role in perspiration . Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type , but not in TRPV4-deficient mice and was inhibited by menthol both in wild-type and TRPM8KO mice . Furthermore , TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis ( AIGA ) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA . In secretory cells of sweat glands present in mouse foot pads , TRPV4 clearly colocalized with cytokeratin 8 , ANO1 , and aquaporin-5 ( AQP5 ) . Mouse sweat glands showed TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases that were inhibited by menthol . The basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor .
[INTRODUCTION] Meanwhile , patients affected by hyperhidrosis can have difficulty in social and professional situations due to increased sweat production , and the resulting subjective perception of illness at an individual level may be substantial . For skin keratinocytes that have relatively low intracellular Cl- concentrations , interaction between TRPV3 and ANO1 causes Cl- influx , followed by increased cellular movement/proliferation in response to cell cycle modulation . There are two basic types of sweating : thermoregulatory and emotional sweating , in addition to gustatory sweating , largely localized to the face and neck regions , that occurs while consuming some foods , particularly pungent foods . The Cl- efflux may drive water efflux through water channels in exocrine gland acinar cells that increase exocrine function and causes depolarization in primary sensory neuron that increases nociception . Although eccrine sweat glands are distributed all over the body , their density is highest in the axillary region and on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet . TRP channels have high Ca2+ permeability , and Ca2+ entering cells through TRP channels activates ANO1 by making a physical complex , leading to Cl- efflux in cells with high intracellular Cl- concentrations . The involvement of TRPV4 in exocrine gland function prompted us to examine the functional interaction in perspiration because TRPV4 is expressed in human eccrine sweat glands . We previously reported the functional interaction between TRP channels and the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel , anoctamin 1 ( ANO1 , also known as TMEM16A ) . Thus , direction of Cl- movement through ANO1 is simply determined by the balance between equilibrium potentials of Cl- and membrane potentials in each cell . We show that the functional interaction of TRPV4 and ANO1 is involved in temperature-dependent sweating and increased friction force . Most sweat glands are of the eccrine type , and they produce a thin secretion that is hypotonic to plasma . These scent glands become active during puberty and secrete a viscous fluid that is associated with body odor . Although sweat glands are innervated by sympathetic neurons , acetylcholine ( Ach ) is released from the nerve endings . In humans , the main function of eccrine sweat glands is body temperature regulation . Meanwhile , apocrine sweat glands are found primarily in
[RESULTS] To examine the functional interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 in mouse sweat glands in vivo , stimulated sweating induced by Ach ( 100 μM , 2 min ) in mouse hind paws at 25 and 35°C was investigated using an iodine and starch reaction to measure secreted amylase . This anti-TRPV4 antibody conspicuously labeled the basal layer of the epidermis , secretory eccrine gland cells , and duct cells only in skin from wild-type ( WT ) mice , but not in skin from TRPV4-deficient ( TRPV4KO ) mice ( Figure 1A ) , indicating the antibody specificity . This result is consistent with earlier studies showing that mouse eccrine glands have a more primitive structure than human glands and
[DISCUSSION] We reported that several TRP channels , including TRPV1 , TRPV3 , TRPV4 , and TRPA1 , can form a complex with the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel , ANO1 , and activate ANO1 via Ca2+ entering cells through TRP channels Interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 causes Cl- efflux , followed by water efflux , suggesting that the complex could be involved in exocrine gland functions including secretion of cerebrospinal fluid , saliva , and tears . Ca2+ entering cells through TRP channels is known to be involved in various Ca2+-mediated events , particularly in non-excitable cells , whereas cation influx-induced depolarization is important for excitation of primary sensory neurons through activation of voltage-gated Na+ channels . Problems with exocrine gland function in patients with Sjögren 's syndrome as well as the low TRPV4 expression levels in patients with AIGA suggest that TRPV4 could be a key molecule involved in these diseases and that novel treatment strategies could

The collected sweat glands were",,961,96,None,"The body’s temperature is controlled by the sweat glands , which produce a thin fluid called acetylcholine . This fluid is released from the nerve endings of the skin , where it is absorbed by the skin cells . The sweat gland is also responsible for regulating the temperature of the body . However , it is not clear how sweat gland activity is controlled . In humans , sweat gland function is regulated by a protein called TRPV4 . It is a type of protein that is found in the skin of humans . A protein called anoctamin 1 ( ANO1 ) , also known as a TRP channel , is found on the surface of skin cells and helps to regulate the temperature . During puberty , a group of cells called keratinocytes secrete a viscous fluid that is associated with body odor . These cells release a chemical called cation salts into the bloodstream , and the salts are released into the body through a process known as perspiration . As a result , the body is able to control the temperature in the body by releasing a molecule called water . One of the chemicals in the water molecule is acetic acid , but it is unclear how this molecule interacts with other molecules in the blood . To investigate this question , Wang et al . studied mice that had a mutation in the gene for a specific protein called the TRP4 protein . When the mice were infected with a disease called idiopathic generalized anhidrosis , they climbed up a slippery slope more easily than the wild-type mice .

[ABSTRACT] As neighbouring folds are gradually merged , the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory , that also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species . We observe a more than fourfold increase in effect size ( from two standard deviations to eight standard deviations ) at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses . Our results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of df = 2 . To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding , we show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology . We show that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes . Our new understanding may , therefore , generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future . Importantly , this new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale . The cerebral cortex displays a bewildering diversity of shapes and sizes across and within species . Despite this diversity , we present a universal multi-scale description of primate cortices . 5 .
[INTRODUCTION] This re-writing highlights a new perspective , or interpretation of the scaling law : it now suggests a relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic measures of cortical size ( given the folded laminar structure of the cortex , areas are the more natural way of measuring its 'size ' ) , At and Ae , respectively , measured in units of A0 . This is reminiscent of fractal scaling , where a complex shape reveals ever smaller levels of self-similar detail as it is probed in ever smaller scales ( or equivalently , higher resolutions ) , represented here by A0 . By examining how areas scale across coarse-grained versions of actual primate cortices , we will be able to directly verify cortical self-similarity . This method is a new systematic way of obtaining shape properties from the cortex in terms of a sequence of morphometric measurements as spatial scale varies . Here , for the first time , we propose to directly construct morphologically plausible realisations of cortices at any specified spatial scale , or resolution . 25 , where the A0=T2k4 is a fundamental area element that defines the threshold between gyrencephaly ( folded cortex ) and lissencephaly ( smooth cortex ) when At=Ae=A0 . Indeed , fractal scaling for various aspects of cortical morphology has often been postulated , with a number of recent papers making use of MRI data . For a constant k the value of A0 is a multiple of T2 , indicating that cortical thickness determines the size of the smallest possible gyri and sulci . For example , at a set scale of 3 mm , sulcal walls that are less than 3 mm apart would be removed , and the neighbouring gyri would be fused . This is achieved through a coarse-graining method that removes morphological details smaller than a specified scale while preserving surface integrity . Although actual fractals are mathematical abstractions , they can often be defined as the limit of iterative processes . Equation 2 is suggestive , but not proof , that cortices are among these forms , with a fractal dimension of 1 . The scaling , or power exponent between the measured intrinsic and extrinsic sizes is the so-called fractal dimension . Most recently published estimates of fractal dimension for the whole cortex are indeed close to
[RESULTS] We have analysed cortices of 11 different primate species : Gray-bellied Night Monkey ( Aotus lemurinus ) , Tufted Capuchin Monkey ( Cebus apella ) , Black-and-white Colobus ( Colobus guereza ) , Senegal Bushbaby ( Galago senegalensis ) , Woolly Monkey ( Lagothrix lagotricha ) , Gray-cheeked Mangabey ( Lophocebus albigena ) , Rhesus Macaque ( Macaca mulatta ) , Common Marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) , Chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) , White-faced Saki ( Pithecia pithecia ) , and various cohorts of human subjects . 5 , nor are they similar to primate or mammalian brains in terms of K or S. Furthermore , Appendix 6 underscores the algorithmic and statistical robustness of these results using multiple realisations of
[DISCUSSION] Compared to previous literature , we can summarise our main contribution and advance as follows : ( i ) We are showing for the first time that representative primate species follow the exact same fractal scaling - as opposed to previous work showing that they have a similar fractal dimension , i. e. , slope , but not necessarily the same offset , as previous methods had no consistent way of comparing offsets . This way of understanding has also been vividly illustrated by using the analogy of forming paper balls with papers of varying thickness in Mota and Herculano-Houzel , 2014 : comparing two paper balls of the same size ( Ae ) will show that the one that uses thicker paper ( T ) will be smoother , have larger folds and a smaller total surface area ( At ) , in comparison with the one using thinner paper . The observation that with increasing voxel
[METHODS] Note this method has also no direct dependency on the original MR image resolution , as the inputs are smooth grey and white matter surface meshes reconstructed from the images using strong ( bio- ) physical assumptions and , therefore , containing more fine-grained spatial information than the raw images ( see also Appendix 2 ) . K=log⁡At−54log⁡Ae+14log⁡T2 is the",,955,96,None,"The brain is made up of many different shapes and sizes , and the size of these shapes can vary widely . For example , the shape of a sulci in a monkey’s brain can be compared to that of an elephant’s . The size of the gyrencephaly in the brain is the same as that of the smooth , folded , lissencephaly , which is a shape that is similar to the shape in the senormous brain . However , it is not clear how the size and shape of the cortices differs between species . To answer this question , Wang et al . used a technique called coarse-graining to study the shape and size of cortical structures in 11 primate species , including the Gray-bellied Night Monkey ( Aotus lemurinus ) , Tufted Capuchin Monkey , Black-and-white Colobus ( Cebus apella ) and Senegal Bushbaby ( Galago ). The experiments show that all corticels are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a dimension of 2 . 5 . This is reminiscent of facial scaling , where a complex shape reveals ever smaller levels of self-similar detail as it is probed in ever smaller scales , represented by A0 . In contrast , at a set scale of 3 mm , neighbouring gYri would be fused , while neighbouring Sulcis would be merged . These findings suggest that the size"

[ABSTRACT] Further , siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells , establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα . Additionally , we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells , identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα . RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells , including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31 . Taken together , we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC . Through Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA , we predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics . The canonical NF-κB transcription factor RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocardinoma ( PDAC ) tumours . In this study , we characterised previously unexplored endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines through live single-cell imaging . Our observations revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid , sustained , and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA .
[INTRODUCTION] To explore potential cytoskeletal or cell shape regulation of RELA in PDAC , we constructed Bayesian models using single-cell datasets from TNFα-stimulated PDAC cells with variation in RELA , actin , and tubulin measurements for hypothesis generation : one dataset with five PDAC cell lines and another with diverse small molecules targeting cytoskeletal components . Using live imaging with knockdown of selected targets , our results uncover novel mechanisms regulating inflammation-associated RELA dynamics in PDAC , including negative feedback loops between RELA and the actin modulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31 , and between RELA and the non-canonical NF-κB protein RELB . Although the mechanistic basis for how cell shape regulates RELA remains poorly understood , studies have shown that chemically inhibiting actin or tubulin dynamics can increase RELA binding to DNA and RELA-dependent gene expression . Inactive RELA is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB proteins and IκB degradation by upstream cues , such as the potent inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor α ( TNFα ) , enables RELA translocation to the nucleus where RELA regulates gene expression . Here , we used CRISPR-CAS9 to tag RELA with GFP in the human PDAC cell lines MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 and identified rapid , non-oscillatory , and heterogeneous RELA dynamics by live imaging . Despite frequent upregulation of both TNFα and RELA in PDAC tumours , the dynamics and regulation of single-cell RELA translocation , as well as RELA transcriptional output , are poorly understood for PDAC cells . Live imaging experiments of fluorescently labelled RELA and electrophoretic mobility shift assays have shown that RELA oscillates between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to TNFα . The pattern of RELA translocation has been shown to dictate the specificity and timing of RELA target gene expression , including the genes encoding IκBα , IκBε , and the chemokine RANTES . Previously , we showed that cell shape is a regulator of RELA dynamics in breast cancer cell lines and that breast cancer cells with mesenchymal cell shape ( protrusive with low cell-cell contacts ) have higher RELA nuclear translocation . The NF-κB transcription factor RELA is an essential mediator of the inflammatory and immune responses in all mammals and is central to the canonical NF-κB signalling pathway . Finally , we used RNA-seq to identify genes with distinct patterns of expression based
[RESULTS] In contrast to our prior findings using Bayesian modelling of RELA and cell shape with breast cancer cells in the absence of cytoskeletal measurements , here we found a general lack of dependence of nuclear RELA on cell shape features , but identified strong and consistent dependencies of nuclear RELA on cytoplasm actin and tubulin , as well as actin texture , in several PDAC cell lines and TNFα doses ( Figure 2D ) . Largely , there were minimal differences between cells by cell cycle stage in terms of peak RELA measurements ( amplitude or timing ) in MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1C and D ) , with the exception of statistically significant lower peak
[DISCUSSION] To identify potential regulatory loops involving RELA in PDAC , we used RNA-seq analysis with MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells treated with varying TNFα doses +/-IκB-SR. We identified 254 genes significantly regulated by TNFα , which may be viewed as candidates for targeting NF-κB signalling or output in PDAC . However , contrary to our expectations based on the findings by Hoffmann et al. , we did not observe RELA oscillations with NFKBIB or NFKBIE depletion in MIA PaCa2 or PANC1 cells , suggesting that the lack of RELA oscillations in these cell lines may be due to enhanced positive feedback and/or insufficient NFKBIA expression . We used Bayesian modelling as an unbiased and high dimensional approach to determine whether descriptors of cell shape and the cytoskeleton correlate with the observed heterogeneity in RELA localisation , having previously used Bayesian modelling to show that RELA localisation in breast cells is strongly dependent on neighbour contact , cell
[METHODS] MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 RELA-GFP cells were seeded at 2000 cells/well in 384-well plates and treated the following day with selected doses of the small-molecule inhibitors for 2 hr plus additional 1 hr co-incubation with 10 ng/ml TNFα ( or DMEM control ) prior to fixation .

This tumour has a large number of genes that are required for the immune system to fight off the disease . However , it is not clear how these genes are activated , or how they are regulated . To investigate this , Wei et al . used live imaging to study the activity of the NF-B transcription factor RELA in PDAC cells . Using a technique called Bayesian analysis , we found that RELA is upregulated in the nucleus of the cells , where it is bound to the DNA , and that it is able to translocate to the cytoplasm . We also found that a protein called ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 interact with RELA . These proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of the immune response , as well as in regulating the expression of genes , such as IB , RANTES and IC .

[ABSTRACT] Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system , where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) inputs regulate muscle activity , we found that daf-18/PTEN mutations impact GABAergic ( but not cholinergic ) neurodevelopment and function . We found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity , therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants . Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog ( PTEN ) , the main negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway , are strongly associated with ASD . Our study provides valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs . Disruptions in the GABAergic system , which alter this equilibrium , are a common feature in various types of neurological disorders , including autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) . The defects observed in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development . However , it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling . A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition ( E/I ) is essential for proper brain function . Ketogenic diets ( KGDs ) have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances . However , the mechanisms underlying their action remain largely elusive . This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling .
[INTRODUCTION] Over the last decade , numerous studies focused on this simple yet highly informative system have significantly contributed to our understanding of the functioning and dysregulation of human genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders , epilepsy , and familial hemiplegic migraine . We demonstrated that exposing daf-18/PTEN mutants to a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate ( βHB ) early in development enhances DAF-16/FOXO activity , mitigates morphological and functional defects in GABAergic neurons , and improves behavioral phenotypes . In humans , ketogenic diets ( KGDs ) , which force fatty acids beta-oxidation into ketone bodies , have been utilized for decades to treat pathologies associated with E/I imbalances , such as refractory epilepsies . This study not only provides a straightforward system for studying the role of the conserved PI3K/Akt/FOXO pathway in neurodevelopment but also contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of ketone bodies in neurodevelopment . The Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system , where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) motor neurons regulate muscle contraction and relaxation , provides an excellent platform for studying the function , balance , and coordination between excitatory and inhibitory signals . We here found that mutations in daf-18 ( the ortholog for PTEN in C. elegans ) result in impairments in GABAergic inhibitory signaling due to decreased activity of the transcription factor DAF-16 ( the ortholog for FOXO in C. elegans ) during neurodevelopment . Furthermore , the substantial conservation of the main components of the PI3K/Akt pathway in C. elegans enhances the applicability of this model system for investigating the role of this pathway in neurodevelopment . In particular , deficits in inhibitory ( GABAergic ) signaling have been reported in autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) and other related physiopathological conditions . PTEN is a classical tumor suppressor gene that antagonizes the highly conserved phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase ( PI3K ) /protein kinase B ( PKB/Akt ) pathway . More recently , KGDs have also demonstrated effectiveness in alleviating autistic symptoms in humans and rodent models of ASD . This targeted impairment of inhibitory signals causes an imbalance between E/I neurotransmission in the animal 's neuromuscular system . Maintaining a delicate balance between excitatory and inhibitory ( E/I ) neurotransmission
[RESULTS] Interestingly , βHB has no effect on GABAergic commissures in either recently hatched L1s or L4 daf-18/PTEN mutants when exposure is limited to the first 9 hr after egg laying ( where ex utero embryonic development occurs ) , possibly due to the impermeability of the chitinous eggshell ( Figure 5D ) . It is noteworthy that we did not observe any improvement in either neuronal outgrowth defects in the AIY interneuron or the migration of the HSN motor neurons ( Figure 4-figure supplement 2 ) in daf-18/PTEN mutants exposed to βHB , even though these defects were shown to depend on the reduction of DAF-16/FOXO activity . While daf-18/PTEN mutants become paralyzed earlier than wild-type animals
[DISCUSSION] However , since the DD commissures are defective already at the very early L1 stage ( prior to rewiring ) and similar defects are observed in VD neurons , which are born post-embryonically between late L1 and L2 stages and do not undergo this remodeling , we can infer that the deficits caused by daf-18/PTEN deficiency affect the development of the entire GABAergic system , independently of the synaptic rearrangement of DD neurons . Our results suggest that the improvement is not due to prevention in DDs because the defects are present in newly hatched larvae regardless of the presence or absence of βHB , and DD post-embryonic growth does not add new errors . Our pharmacological experiments showed that mutants associated with an exacerbation of the PI3K pathway , which typically inhibits the nuclear translocation and activity of the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO , lead to E/I imbalances that manifest as hypersensitivity
[METHODS] Transgenic strains were generated by microinjection of plasmid DNA containing the construct Punc-47 : :daf-18cDNA ( kindly provided by Alexandra Byrne , UMASS Chan Medical School ) at 20 ng/µl into the germ line of ( daf-18 ( ok480 ) ; lin-15 ( n765ts ) ) double mutants with the co-injection marker lin-15 rescuing plasmid pL15EK ( 80",,974,97,None,"In humans , the brain is made up of two motor neurons , called the cholinergic and inhibitory neurons . These neurons are responsible for the movement of the brain , and they are also responsible for regulating the activity of other motor neurons in the body . In some cases , this balance between excitatory and inhibiting signals is disrupted , which can lead to neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) . Ketogenic diets have been used in the past to treat conditions associated with E/I imbalances . However , it is not clear how these effects are regulated . The Caenorhabditis elegans is an example of a model organism that has been used to study the effects of ketogenic diets on the development of the nervous system . It is thought that a protein called Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog ( PTEN ) plays a role in the regulation of the GABAergic system , but it was not clear whether PTEN is involved in this process .

[ABSTRACT] Innate immune responses triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 , while host factors including proinflammatory cytokines are critical for viral containment . Mechanistically , IL-1β activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway , which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions , thus prevents syncytia formation . Together , by revealing the function and underlying mechanism of IL-1β on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion , our study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection . By utilizing quantitative and qualitative models , we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells . Through cytokine screening , we identified that interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , a key mediator of inflammation , inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains . Notably , in vivo infection experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium .
[INTRODUCTION] Notably , we identified that IL-1β , which is the key factor of inflammatory response , inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced syncytia formation in various cells by activating RhoA/ROCK pathway to initiate actin bundle formation at cell-cell interface between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells . Moreover , syncytia formation among pneumocytes with long-term persistence of viral RNA has been observed in the lung autopsy of deceased COVID-19 donors , which may contribute to prolonged clearance of the virus and long COVID symptoms . In addition , when corticosteroids were applied to suppress the inflammatory response in patients infected by SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV , the clearance of viral RNA was obviously delayed , suggesting the importance of innate immune factors in viral clearance . The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection has spread globally , with at least 755 million people diagnosed and the death toll is over 6 . Syncytia formation between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with neighboring cells may contribute to increased viral transmission and pathogenicity in the infected host , which also makes the virus insensitive to extracellular neutralizing antibodies . Among these cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 , the combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ induces inflammatory cell death , resulting in clear tissue damage , while other cytokines ' function remains obscure . However , low IFN levels with impaired ISG responses were observed during early SARS-CoV-2 infection , which may have compromised the antiviral responses of IFN in severe COVID-19 patients . Lung epithelial cells are the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission , which subsequently recruit and activate innate immune cells , leading to COVID-19 pathology . SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern , including Alpha , Beta , Delta , and Omicron , continue to evolve and increase transmissibility and the ability to escape host immune responses . It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2-mediated syncytia formation is effectively inhibited by multiple interferon ( IFN ) -stimulating genes ( ISGs ) . Thus , identifying other endogenous host factors that regulate syncytia formation is of great significance for harnessing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 . In this process , tissue-resident macrophages and circulating monocytes contribute to local and systemic inflammation primarily by releasing inflammatory cytokines . SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cell-cell fusion ( also known as syncytia formation ) in multiple cell types including lung epithelial cells , neurons , and glia . Innate immune cells
[RESULTS] Therefore , we further explored whether IL-1β was also able to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike-induced cell-cell fusion in ACE2- or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP4 ) -expressing cells by bioluminescence assay , immunoblotting , and a modified stop-mCherry fluorescent model , wherein mCherry reporter is only expressed when Cre excises the Stop cassette inside the fused syncytia ( Figure 2-figure supplement 7A ) . Of note , when we isolated tissue cells from the IL-1β-treated mice and infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2 , it was found that S2 ' cleavage and N protein levels were strongly reduced in IL-1β-treated mice-derived lung and intestine tissue cells compared to control ( Figure 6G and Figure 6-figure supplement 2E ) , suggesting that IL-1β may have protective effects on
[DISCUSSION] In our study , MyD88 or IRAK4 deficiency abolished the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion , suggesting that these innate immune molecules are critical to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection , and this may be another mechanism accounting for the disease of those patients . Moreover , lipid nanoparticle in mRNA vaccine and penton base in adenovirus vaccine can both activate innate immune cells to amplify the protective effect of vaccines , which may also be attributed to IL-1β-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion on top of adaptive immune responses induced by the vaccines . As RhoA is ubiquitously expressed by all cell types , it is currently unclear whether IL-1-mediated RhoA activation is specific toward viral infection-associated cytoskeleton modification , or may regulate other RhoA-related processes , which is a limitation of the current work and remains to be investigated in future . In summary , this study demonstrated the function and mechanism of IL-1β in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia formation
[METHODS] For primary human lung cells , the human lung tissues were cut into small pieces of about 2 mm3 and washed three times with HBSS solution containing 1 % PS , digested with collagenase type I ( 100 mg+50 mL PBS ) in an incubator at 37°C for 4 hr . At day 7 , mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of",,948,96,None,"Infection with a virus can lead to the death of many people , including those who are at high risk of developing a severe respiratory disease . The virus can also infect other cells in the body , such as the lungs , which are the main targets of the virus . This is because the virus can infect cells that are not normally infected , and it can also cause the virus to spread to other cells . Infections with the virus have been linked to a number of health problems . One of the most common causes of respiratory disease is the infection of the lung , where the virus is transmitted from one person to another . However , it is not clear how the virus spreads to other parts of the body and how it can be prevented . For example , some people have a weakened immune system , while others do not . To prevent the virus from spreading , a group of cells called macrophages and circulating monocytes are involved in the process of forming a bundle of cytokines called actin bundles . These bundles are made up of proteins called IL-1 , or interleukin-1 , that are released by the immune system and activate the production of inflammatory molecules called cytokine . Interestingly , this is the first study to show that the IL-like protein , called interleucine-1 ( or iL-1 for short ) , inhibits the formation of syncytia between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells in mice . Further experiments in mice showed that IL1 inhibited the fusion of the cytokinets between the SARS–CoV2-induced cells and the neighboring cell , thus preventing the virus spreading "

[ABSTRACT] Taken together , we demonstrate that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state . To investigate the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity , we quantified the effects of nutritional and internal state changes on IPCs using electrophysiological recordings . Accordingly , activating IPCs had a small , satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity , whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity . This was reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect , where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application . Functional connectivity experiments demonstrated that these DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity , while other DH44Ns inhibit them . Refeeding flies with glucose or fructose , two nutritive sugars , significantly increased IPC activity , whereas non-nutritive sugars had no effect . Hence , populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis . Contrary to IPCs , Diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis ( DH44PINs ) responded to glucose perfusion . Drosophila insulin-producing cells ( IPCs ) are functional analogues of mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin directly into circulation . In contrast to feeding , glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity . We found that the nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity . IPC activity decreased with increasing periods of starvation . Insulin plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis .
[INTRODUCTION] However , the influence of feeding and nutritional state changes on IPC activity in vivo , as well as the nutritional state-dependent response of IPCs to glucose , remain unclear , underscoring the importance of in vivo studies where all nutrient-sensing and sensorimotor circuits are intact . Our findings imply distinct mechanisms by which IPCs and DH44PINs sense changes in nutritional state , underlining the significance of multiple pathways in orchestrating Drosophila 's response to nutritional state changes and ensuring metabolic homeostasis . These IPCs secrete Drosophila insulin-like peptides ( DILPs ) and are sensitive to changes in the metabolic state , the behavioral state , the circadian time , aminergic and peptidergic modulatory inputs , and other peripheral signals . A subset of octopaminergic neurons expressing Drosophila insulin receptor ( dInR ) are necessary for the regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity implicating that IPCs play a role in modulating foraging behavior . As a key hub integrating metabolic state information , IPCs are thought to be part of the neuronal circuitry that regulates food intake , in part by regulating foraging behavior . For instance , how does IPC activity differ when glucose is ingested as part of a meal , compared to when glucose is administered directly to the brain or into circulation ? In combination , our approaches show that IPC activity is not just nutritional state-dependent , but that IPCs also exhibit an incretin-like effect . While DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity on short timescales , DH44 neurons outside the PI ( DH44Ns ) form strong inhibitory connections to IPCs . Conversely , during periods of starvation , insulin release is downregulated , which promotes the conservation of energy resources and enables energy mobilization via counter-regulatory pathways . This underlines the complexity of insulin regulation , emphasizing that insulin secretion is not solely dictated by sugar levels but influenced by multiple factors . In mammalian systems , insulin release is significantly amplified upon glucose ingestion vs. intravenous administration , a phenomenon known as the 'incretin effect ' . We further establish that the nutritional state strongly modulates locomotor activity , and that IPCs play a small but significant role in this . To address this , we optogenetically manipulated IPCs and
[RESULTS] Since these are not the only neurons we activate in the TDC2 line , we speculate that the stopping phenotype could also result from concerted effects of octopamine and tyramine modulating muscle contractions and motor neuron excitability , as previously described in Drosophila larvae , or from OANs interfering with pattern generating networks in the ventral nerve cord ( VNC ) during longer activation . To further confirm whether IPC activity increases after refeeding were sugar-specific or could also be recovered by other specific nutrients , like protein , we kept 24 h starved flies on a high protein diet ( HP ) and compared the IPC activity after refeeding for 18-24 h. Similar to refeeding on
[DISCUSSION] Our experimental techniques limit our ability to capture these fast initial dynamics , since the preparation for intracellular recordings requires tens of minutes , so that we typically recorded IPC activity at least 20 min after the last food ingestion . Another reason why we performed experiments under light conditions and not in the dark is that switching from dark to light leads to a startle response in optogenetic activation experiments when the red LED is switched on , which masks behavioural responses induced by neuronal activation . However , the observation that IPC activity in flies refed with SD remained comparable to that of starved flies suggests that starvation had a long-lasting effect on IPC activity , which could specifically be restored by feeding nutritive sugars ( glucose and fructose ) . Increased insulin sensitivity has been reported in multiple mammalian studies which used a starvation-refeeding paradigm to study effects of
[METHODS] The camera 's lens was equipped with an IR-pass filter ( lower cut-off frequency : 760 nm ) that only permits the IR light to pass through to ensure a strong contrast between the background ( black ) and flies ( bright ) . Continuous time series recordings of the membrane potential were captured in current clamp mode",,973,97,None,"The brain is made up of cells called insulin-producing cells ( IPCs ) that produce insulin , which is released into the bloodstream . In the fruit fly Drosophila , the insulin production is regulated by a network of neurons called the pars intercerebralis ( PI ) . The PI is a part of the brain that senses changes in the metabolic state of the fly , and is also involved in regulating foraging behavior . However , it is not clear how the PI and PI are connected to each other . To investigate this question , Xu et al . used a technique called electrophysiology to study the activity of IPC neurons in fruit flies . Using a microscope , they examined the activity and activity of PI neurons in fly brains . These experiments showed that the activity levels of a subset of iPC neurons were affected by changes in their metabolic state . This was reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect , where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application . Furthermore , activating IPC cells had a small effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity , while activating DH44N neurons had no effect . Finally , using a combination of electrophysiological and physiological approaches , these results suggest that IPC activity is not only dependent on the nutritional state , but also on the neuronal circuitry that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolism ."

[ABSTRACT] We engineered an iPS cell line to express the large fragment of the split mNeonGreen protein ( mNG21-10 ) and showed that it enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the short fragment ( mNG211 ) . Using split mNeonGreen for large-scale endogenous tagging in human iPSCs would open the door to studying protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types . We also demonstrate that neural network-based image restoration enables live imaging studies of highly dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSCs . However , generating human cell lines carrying endogenous tags is difficult due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair . Recently , an engineered split mNeonGreen protein was used to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in HEK293 cells . This work represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells . Endogenous tags have become invaluable tools to visualize and study native proteins in live cells .
[INTRODUCTION] The mNG211 fragment is only 16 amino acids long , so it can be inserted into the genome by HDR using a repair template with short homology arms ( generally 40-80 bp ) , which can be purchased commercially as a single-stranded oligo-deoxynucleotide ( ssODN ) . Since most of our knowledge of human cell cytokinesis is derived from diseased and/or transformed cell lines , the field will benefit greatly from studying iPSCs before and after differentiation in an isogenic context , particularly since they represent 'healthy ' human cells . This has been done by random lentiviral integration followed by antibiotic selection , which is fast but generates a heterogeneous population where the expression of the large fragment is inconsistent across the cell population and is subject to epigenetic silencing . However , while this library will be a valuable resource for the community , there is a need to study protein function in other cell types , where the mechanisms regulating biological processes could vary drastically . Since their discovery in 2007 , human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) have become a popular tool to study human cells in developmental contexts and to identify disease-causing mutations , amongst other valuable applications . Although several efforts have been made to tag multiple proteins endogenously in various human cell lines , the generation of a genome-wide library of tagged proteins in human cells requires higher throughput . CRISPR/Cas9 is used to introduce a double-stranded break at the target site , which can be repaired by homology-directed repair ( HDR ) using a repair template carrying the fluorescent marker . With the advent of gene editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 , the genes encoding fluorescent proteins can now be inserted directly into the genome at a desired locus . Finally , we show how the endogenously tagged iPS cell lines can be used for live imaging studies of cytokinesis , which is a highly dynamic cellular process . Imaging the more weakly expressed genes required the use of an image restoration algorithm to alleviate cell toxicity and obtain high-quality images with high temporal resolution . In the split mNeonGreen system , the mNeonGreen protein is expressed as two separate fragments : a large fragment composed of the first ten beta-strands of mNeonGreen ( mNG21-10 ) and a short fragment corresponding to the eleventh beta strand . Since GFP was first described
[RESULTS] After a few minutes of imaging using standard optical settings , iPSCs stopped dividing and detached from the coverslip , independently of laser wavelength ( data not shown ) , suggesting that iPSCs are more sensitive to photo-toxicity than transformed and cancerous cell lines . This data reveals new differences in how cytokinesis occurs in iPSCs and demonstrates the utility of endogenous tags to study cellular processes by live imaging , which also can be done in differentiated cell types with isogenic backgrounds . Transfection of clone 28 cells with a plasmid expressing H2B ( histone ) fused to the mNG11 fragment resulted in the expression of a fluorescent signal localized to chromatin as expected for the functional complementation of the mNG21-10 and mNG211 fragments
[DISCUSSION] Unwanted editing outcomes are ignored when looking at pooled populations , and we recommend isolating and screening clonal cell lines to perform quantitative studies of desired cellular processes , as they provide a more reliable readout of protein expression , where variations in signal between cells within a population represent true cell-to-cell variability . Self-complementing split fluorescent proteins have been used for efficient endogenous tagging , and this approach was recently used for the construction of the first library of endogenous tags in HEK293 cells , with 1310 proteins tagged in mixed populations enriched by FACS . We also created a macro for image-based colony screening in 96-well plates ( Figure 3-figure supplement 1B-G ) , and used multiplexed Nanopore sequencing for high-throughput screening of selected colonies , as many amplicons can be sequenced simultaneously . We used CARE , a content-aware image restoration neural network developed by Weigert et al. , 2018 , where training datasets are created with matched images
[METHODS] Because of its weak fluorescent signal , the CDH1-mNG211 edited cells were seeded in a 35 mm polymer coverslip dish ( Cellvis ) coated with iMatrix-511 Silk , and imaged on an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with a Livescan Sweptfield scanner ( Nikon ) , Piezo Z stage ( Prior ) , IXON 879 EMCCD camera (",,943,96,None,"Cells that are able to grow and divide are known as stem cells . These cells are made of a protein called mNeonGreen , which can be inserted into the DNA of the cell . This protein is then tagged into the genome by a gene editing tool called CRISPR/Cas9 . However , it is not known how this protein can be used to tag other proteins . In humans , stem cells are a type of cell that can divide and divide in a variety of ways , including in the body . One of the most common ways stem cells can be studied is by using a cell line called HEK293 . Using a technique called a neural network , the neural network can be programmed to tag a specific protein , such as a fluorescent protein . The neural network is made up of two different proteins: a large fragment of the protein mNG21-10 and a short fragment corresponding to the eleventh strand . It is then translated into a sequence of proteins that can then be tagged in the genome . A technique called homology-directed repair is used to repair the broken proteins , but it is difficult to do this in human stem cells because it requires a lot of effort . Now , Wang et al . have developed a new method to tag proteins in human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) . They used a computer program to create a small protein called the split Neon Green protein and then used it to tag the proteins in the cellular environment . To do this , they inserted the protein into the cell’s genome , and the images were restored to the original image quality . Wang also showed that the neural networks can be trained to restore the image quality"

This electrolytic lesioning method avoids disruptive procedures , provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury , and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning . Performance of this novel lesioning technique was validated using histology from ex vivo and in vivo testing , current and voltage traces from the device , and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning . Here , we present and test a platform for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted , intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology . This technique can be used in many areas of cortex , in several species , and theoretically with any multielectrode probe . The low-cost , external lesioning device can also easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup . A custom-built current source provides stable current and allows for controlled , repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals . They stand to provide additional insight if integrated with multielectrode techniques common in systems neuroscience . Lesion studies have historically been instrumental for establishing causal connections between brain and behavior .
[INTRODUCTION] Over the days and potentially weeks Bundy and Nudo , 2019 ; Zeiler et al. , 2016 following a termination , the surrounding circuitry and broader network may adapt , leading to behavioral recovery and demonstrating that although the terminated region was causally implicated in behavioral control in the moment , the terminated neurons are not themselves causally necessary . A further benefit of this surgery-free procedure is avoiding analgesia and sedation and allowing for an unprecedented , minutes-long turn-around between pre- and post-lesion data collection ; the experiment can resume as soon as close observation of the animal is complete , the lesion device is disconnected , and the recording stream is reconnected . By using a Utah multielectrode array as in this work , the location of the lesion can be changed at a 400 μm resolution set by the electrode spacing , while altering the duration and amount of current passed through two electrodes creates changes in the lesion 's spatial extent . While the link between the lesion location and the multielectrode location technically constrains the lesion to an area of cortex in which a multielectrode array could be implanted , we see the connection as a positive , because it ensures recording some neuroelectrophysiology from the perilesional area in which recovery is hypothesized to occur ( see Appendix 1 ) . The dual use of this microelectrode array achieves the first design consideration of stable electrophysiology pre- and post-inactivation , as it enables recording from the exact same signal source with minimal physical disruption or displacement . Prior termination studies mostly measure behavioral output , with no simultaneous measures of neuronal activity during the behavior , impairing their ability to provide insight into the causal connection between the brain and behavior , or with no baseline ( i. e. pre-lesion ) measures of neuronal activity . Thus , while there is still variation in the precise geometry of damage from each lesion , multielectrode-based lesioning does well to satisfy the second design consideration and is a notable refinement from previous lesioning studies . As the lesioning device is a small , low-cost external system that only needs to be connected for the duration of lesioning , it is easy to adopt into existing electrophysiology recording settings .
[RESULTS] Our exploration was not exhaustive and not designed to fully characterize lesion extent as a function of current amplitude and duration ; while being mindful of animal use , a key aim was to converge on a parameter set that yielded small , focal lesions suitable for behavioral studies in rhesus macaques with chronic implants . While lesions with larger current amplitudes and durations create cavitations in cortex ( as in all of the ex vivo and the longest in vivo lesion ) , lesions where the current had a lower amplitude and/or was applied for a shorter duration resulted in rarefied tissue damage ( as seen in Figure 3 ) , containing parenchymal rarefaction , coagulative necrosis ,
[DISCUSSION] One recent study , , developed an inactivation method that is effectively combined with stable electrophysiology by creating photothrombotic lesions through a chronic cranial window integrated with an electrocorticography ( ECoG ) array , which may be appropriate for applications where local field potential ( LFP ) recording is sufficient . Therefore , we have triangulated evidence from three distinct sources that indicate the electrolytic lesioning device reliably delivered current that caused tissue damage and neuron death ( termination ) : ex vivo and in vivo histology ( Figures 2 and 3 ) , lesion device readouts ( Figure 6 ) , and relative changes in the turnover rate of recorded neurons in vivo ( Figure 7C and D , case 1 ) . However , typical current values for microstimulation are around three times smaller than for lesioning , pulse durations are on the order of tens of microseconds , and the pulses
[METHODS] Neuronal data was collected at 30 kHz from primary motor cortex of Monkeys H and U using a Utah array ( described above ) , captured using a Cerebus system ( Blackrock Neurotech , Salt Lake City , UT ) , then high-pass filtered offline with a fourth order , zero-phase Butterworth filter using a 250 Hz cutoff frequency",,967,97,None,"The brain is a complex network of neurons , which are able to communicate with each other . The brain also has a number of different types of neurons that can be damaged , including those that are involved in the behavior of the animal . For example , if a neuron loses its function , it can cause a brain injury . However , the damage to the brain can also be caused by a loss of a specific type of neuron , such as a traumatic brain injury or a stroke . In this study , researchers used a device called a multielectrode array to create a lesion in the brain of rhesus macaques . This device was designed to record the activity of the remaining neuronal population after the lesion , and it can be used in many areas of the brain , in several species , as well as theoretically with any multi-electron probe . It can be connected to a single electrode , but it must be connected for the entire lesion to be recorded . To do this , an electrode is attached to the end of the electrode . When the electrode is disconnected , all the electrodes are connected to one another , making it possible to record all the activity from the same source . These results suggest that a new type of lesioning technique could be developed that could be applied to other parts of the body , like the brain and spinal cord ."

[ABSTRACT] Here , we use an assay for the detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ) . As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts , we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops . Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of imidacloprid , thiamethoxam , clothianidin , or sulfoxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude , even when these solutions contained lethal doses . Studies of bee detection of neonicotinoids have reported contradictory evidence about whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and hence avoid them . These data provide strong evidence that bumblebees can not detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts . Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation . One of the largest risks bees face is poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides . Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops , but their populations are at risk when pesticides are used .
[INTRODUCTION] In addition , we comprehensively tested these solutions on the gustatory receptor neurons in the A-type sensilla on the galea and the labial palps of the bees ' mouthparts using electrophysiology to determine whether sensilla in multiple locations are able to detect neonicotinoids ( IMD , CLO , and TMX ) and the previously untested sulfoxamine pesticide , sulfoxaflor ( SFX ) . Subsequently , however , another study in a different species of bumblebees ( B. impatiens ) using methods similar to ours reported that bees are neither attracted nor deterred from consuming sugar solutions containing neonicotinoids , consistent with the idea that they can not detect the pesticides . In addition , other compounds that affect cholinergic signalling in the insect nervous system , such as sulfoxaflor , have been proposed as alternatives to neonicotinoids , but whether or not these compounds can be detected by the bee 's sense of taste has not previously been tested . Previously , we observed that stimulation of the mouthpart 's galeal sensilla with neonicotinoids in water did not elicit spikes from any GRNs , nor did we see a reduction in the rate of firing of sugar-sensing GRNs in the sensilla when stimulated with a mixture of sucrose and neonicotinoid compound . These authors concluded that the only way bees could solve this problem was if they used their sense of taste to identify the preferred solution , arguing that further work needed to be done to identify the mechanism for sensation . Our previous work on neonicotinoid taste used sucrose to stimulate the galeal sensilla and did not analyse how pesticides might alter the burst structure of the galeal GRN response to sugars or test the labial palps . To definitively test whether bumblebees detect neonicotinoids on their mouthparts , we quantified the structure of feeding when the mouthparts of freely-moving bumblebees ( B. terrestris ) were stimulated with nectar-like solutions containing pesticides over a 2 min period . Clearly , deeper investigations could determine whether the mouthparts GRNs possess novel gustatory mechanisms for pesticide detection and provide critical information about the risk to bees of consuming the nectar of pesticide-defended crops in the field . In a two choice assay , we unexpectedly found that when bees were given a choice between
[RESULTS] To understand if the population of neurons we recorded from contained information about stimulus identity , we combined the temporal responses binned at 100ms intervals over 1 s of recording of all 7 GRNs across mouthparts using a clustering algorithm ( t-SNE and k-means clustering ) . However , the structure of feeding towards 1 mM QUI was similar to the results found for the cluster analysis of the GRNs : bees tested with 1 mM QUI exhibited much shorter average first feeding bout duration and shorter average cumulative bout duration than those fed with OSR or 0 . Stimulation with extremely high concentrations of TMX reduced the average firing rates of LPIII2 and LPIV2 ; none of the
[DISCUSSION] Although we were able to measure small but significant reduction in the responses of both labial palp and galeal neurons caused by the high concentrations ( 100 µM ) of IMD , SFX , and TMX , this effect was not sufficient for the clustering algorithm to form classes of distinct stimuli for the OSR-pesticide mixtures . While it is possible that the sensilla on the antennae or tarsi could detect TMX , it seems unlikely given that honeybees have limited bitter detection in these locations , only observed when the sensilla are contacted with concentrations of compounds like QUI that are > 1 mM . The labial palps in other insects such as locusts are used to detect both phagostimulants and deterrant compounds , so we might have rationally expected to observe labial palp GRNs that spike in response to QUI and cholinergic pesticides , but we did not . Although Arce et al.
[METHODS] In order to assess field-relevant concentrations of each chemical , a concentration series of each of imidacloprid , thiamethoxam , clothianidin , and sulfoxaflor was made via tenfold serial dilution using OSR to produce nectar containing the pesticides at 1000 , 100 , 10 , and 1 , and 0 nM ( pure OSR ) . 1 mM was",,964,97,None,"Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops and are responsible for a wide range of environmental problems . One of the biggest risks bees face is poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides . Bees can detect the presence of pesticides in the nectar of crops by using their sense of taste . However , it is not clear how bee populations can detect these chemicals . To investigate this question , Xiao et al . used a technique called electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of a bumblebee , Bombus terrestris , detect pesticide concentrations in a solution that mimics the nectarin of oilseed rape . The experiments showed that the bee's salivary glands detect the concentrations of the chemicals in the solution , but they were not able to detect the pesticide levels . This suggests that bee larvae are at high risk of poisoning by insects . In addition , bee pupae are more likely to eat pesticide-containing solutions , which are more toxic than other insects , such as flies . These findings suggest that if bee colony a field , they may be able , in part , to avoid consuming pesticide compounds . For example , when bee colonies eat a mixture of sugars containing sulfoxamine and imidacloprid , the sulphamine-containing pesticide could be detected in the saliva of bee mates ."

[ABSTRACT] Meta-analysis of 6322 NHPs from 148 sites reveals that prevalence is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia , with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo . These findings address critical gaps in understanding regional P. knowlesi epidemiology and indicate that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk . By assembling remote sensing data and fitting statistical models to prevalence at multiple spatial scales , we identify novel relationships between P. knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation . This suggests that higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity , which would begin to explain observed geographic variation in parasite burden . Non-human primates ( NHPs ) host Plasmodium knowlesi , a zoonotic malaria of public health concern and the main barrier to malaria elimination in Southeast Asia . Zoonotic disease dynamics in wildlife hosts are rarely quantified at macroecological scales due to the lack of systematic surveys . Here , we systematically assemble reports of NHP P. knowlesi and investigate geographic determinants of prevalence in reservoir species . We find that regions exhibiting higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots . In wildlife and humans , parasite transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation . Understanding of regional P. knowlesi infection dynamics in wildlife is limited .
[INTRODUCTION] Although macroecological studies that utilise geospatial data are often confounded by issues of matching temporal and spatial scales , as well as by the quality and accuracy of available georeferencing , measures can be taken to account for this when examining the role of environmental factors in modulating disease outcomes . While sporadic cases have been reported across Southeast Asia , including in Indonesia , the Philippines , Vietnam , Brunei , and Myanmar , the majority of P. knowlesi cases are found in East Malaysia ( Borneo ) with hotspots in the states of Sabah and Sarawak , areas that have seen extensive deforestation and landscape modification . In relation to P. knowlesi , utility of fine-scale remote-sensing data has been demonstrated : examples include satellite-derived data used to examine household-level exposure risk in relation to proximate land configuration , UAV-imagery used to link real-time deforestation to macaque host behavioural change , and remote-sensing data used to interrogate risk factors for vector breeding sites . We hypothesise that prevalence of P. knowlesi in primate host species is spatially heterogeneous and that higher prevalence is partially driven by forest loss and fragmentation , contributing to the strong associations described between land use , land cover and human P. knowlesi risk . Systematic tools developed for epidemiological studies of disease prevalence in human populations are rarely applied to the study of wildlife disease prevalence ; however , such tools can be used to capture the scale and contrast required in macroecological studies to quantify disease burdens regionally . Independent studies investigating P. knowlesi in primates are typically constrained by small sample sizes and confined geographic areas , limiting inference that can be made about relationships between infection dynamics and landscape characteristics . Considering the spillover risk posed by wildlife reservoirs of P. knowlesi , clarifying any relationships between environmental factors and parasitaemia in key host species may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of P. knowlesi transmission patterns . In Sabah , human prevalence of P. knowlesi infection has recently been shown to be specifically associated with recent loss of intact forest , agricultural activities , and fragmentation across multiple localised spatial scales . Currently , distribution of P. knowlesi cases is thought to be restricted to the predicted ranges of known vector and host
[RESULTS] In sensitivity analyses removing data points with excessive spatial uncertainty or restricting data points only to areas with high probability of macaque occurrence , evidence was consistently found that tree canopy cover ( 5 km ) and host species exhibit a strong positive association with prevalence of P. knowlesi in NHP ( Appendix 6 ) . Following a two-stage approach for selection of explanatory variables , tree cover and fragmentation ( measured by perimeter : area ratio , PARA ) were retained at 5 km as linear terms , human population density was retained at both 5 km and 20 km and primate species was retained as a categorical variable . Environmental covariates were extracted from satellite-derived remote sensing datasets
[DISCUSSION] This study also demonstrates the utility of systematic meta-analysis tools and remote-sensing datasets in the investigation of macroecological disease trends , in conjunction with methods to standardise a spatially heterogeneous dataset and data-driven selection of spatial scales . Prevalence of P. knowlesi in macaques is likely to be a crucial determinant of human infection risk , and more representative estimates of P. knowlesi prevalence derived here can better inform regional transmission risk models . Given the clear intersection between human epidemiology and wildlife ecology , it is essential that infection dynamics within wildlife reservoirs are considered in future public health interventions . Strong links have been identified between land use and land cover change and ecosystem perturbation that favours the transmission of vector-borne diseases . While the full complexity is not captured by the covariates used , it is clear that P. knowlesi infection in NHPs is not restricted to densely forested areas . Notwithstanding
[METHODS] Spatial sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding data points from administrative boundaries outside a reasonable size or above a reasonable threshold of environmental certainty , according to the standard deviation ( SD ) of the covariate values within each set of 10 environmental realisations ( Appendix 5-figure 2 , Appendix 6-tables 4-6 ) . For each independent primate study",,965,97,None,"Plasmodium knowlesi is a zoonotic parasite that causes malaria in humans and other animals . It is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito , which can be transmitted to humans by flies . The parasite is transmitted from one animal species to another , and it can cause serious health problems in humans . However , it is not known how the parasite spreads to humans , or how it is transmitted between humans and the host . In Southeast Asia , malaria is endemic in the areas where it is most common , including Borneo , Indonesia , Malaysia , Burma , Thailand , Cambodia , Myanmar , Sri Lanka and Thailand . Currently , there are no systematic surveys of malaria in non-human primates ( NHPs ) , a group of animals that live in the wild . This is because they do not have access to a large amount of data , so they are not able to accurately measure the prevalence of the disease . To address this problem , Weiss et al . used remote sensing data from 6322 NHP sites in Southeast Asia to study the prevalence and spread of P . knowlesis in NHP populations . They found that the prevalence is heterogeneous across the region , with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Bornea . These findings suggest that higher prevalence may be due to forest fragmentation , as well as to habitat complexity ."

[ABSTRACT] To elucidate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events , we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae . Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana , associated with Pinopsida ( conifer ) host plants , with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches . Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined , evolving new trophic interactions , including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms . Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana 's breakup , surviving on distant , disjunct landmasses . Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia ( Australian region ) and Proterhinus ( Hawaiian Islands ) have relatively recent origins . The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions .
[INTRODUCTION] We sought to answer two main questions about the distribution and host plant associations of crown group Belidae : ( 1 ) is the development of larvae of Agnesiotidini and Pachyurini ( Belinae ) and Oxycraspedina ( Oxycoryninae ) in conifer hosts an ancient , primary association or the result of more recent , secondary colonization , and ( 2 ) how did the interplay between biogeographical process and host plant shifts influence and shape the trophic associations of belids ? Since the landmark study of weevil family-level phylogeny by Kuschel , 1995 , several studies based on morphological characters of adults and larvae have inferred the phylogenetic relationships of Belidae and revised their tribal-level classification , and hypotheses for generic phylogenetic relationships based on analyses of morphological data have been proposed for both the subfamilies Belinae and Oxycoryninae . On account of their extraordinary taxonomic diversity and varied trophic interactions with contemporary gymnosperms and flowering plants , beetles ( order Coleoptera ; > 400 , 000 described extant species ) have been widely used as models to study the evolution of diversity at the insect-plant interface . However , ( 1 ) the degree to which contemporary trophic interactions reflect those in the past , e. g. , representing relatively ancient primary associations versus more recent secondary associations , and ( 2 ) the relative roles of vicariance ( including major palaeogeographical events ) and dispersal in the evolution of host shifts , remain unclear . The present paper addresses a significant gap in our understanding of the biogeography and evolution of host plant associations in the family Belidae ( belid weevils ) , an ancient group of phytophagous beetles whose extant species exhibit specialized trophic associations with gymnosperms and flowering plants . The adults appear to feed mainly on stem tissues but sometimes also on pollen , some being important pollinators , and the larvae develop in the bark and woody tissues of decaying branches or twigs , gymnosperm strobili , flower buds or fruits . By reconstructing the evolutionary history of belid weevils and examining the dynamics of their host plant associations and geographical distributions over time , this paper seeks to yield new insights into the evolution of modern insect-plant interactions . Gymnosperms ( cycads , conifers and relatives ) , the dominant plant group during the Mesozoic Era , thrived from the Permian to
[RESULTS] The family Belidae , the subfamilies Belinae and Oxycoryninae , the tribes of Belinae ( Agnesiotidini , Belini and Pachyurini ) and most subtribes of Oxycoryninae ( Oxycraspedina , Metrioxenina , Aglycyderina and Oxycorynina ) were robustly supported as monophyletic ( UFBoot ≥95 AND SH-aLRT ≥80 ) in the trees resulting from the three partitioning schemes ( Figure 1 ) . Analyses of datasets including flanking regions ( 33t434g ) consistently recovered higher statistical support for the sister-group relationship between Oxycraspedina and Aglycyderini , which was further supported by the four-cluster likelihood mapping analyses ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1b , c ) . The tribe Oxycorynini in its current concept , was not recovered as a monophylum , Oxycraspedina instead forming the sister-group of
[DISCUSSION] This is particularly noticeable even within some belid genera , whose larvae have been found developing in similar tissues ( under bark and in branches ) of different plant families , both between congeneric species ( e. g. Sphinctobelus ) and in single species ( e. g. Isacantha , Rhicnobelus ) ; however , there are some cases known in Belidae where the use of plant organs is apparently plastic and opportunistic ( e. g. Apagobelus brevirostris ( Lea ) reared from both stems and cones of Araucaria ; Zimmerman , 1994 ) . Even though our reconstruction provides support for their ancestral hosts most likely being the Pinopsida , which is in accordance with our clade age estimates , angiosperm hosts can not be completely ruled out , considering that crown angiosperms are now thought to have originated earlier than Belidae , in the interval between the late Permian and the latest Jurassic ( 256-149 Ma ) . The type

They have evolved to live in the same environment as other insects , and they have been used as models to study the evolution of plants and animals . The bees have evolved from a single species of insect , known as Belidae , to a larger family of insects called the belids . In the past , the beeves were known to be closely related to plants , such as gymnosperms and flowering plants . However , it was not clear how these beevlies adapted to their new environment , or how they evolved to adapt to new environments . Now , Wang et al . have used a technique called molecular genetics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of belid species in Australia and the Hawaiian Islands . To do this , they used phylogenetic data from fossils and DNA from the fossil record to build a time tree for belid families . This tree shows that Belididae originated in Gondwana , Australia , about 138 Ma ago . Some of the beveled insects shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsidala when and where conifers declined , evolving new trophic interactions , including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with angiospermal parasitic achlorophyllous aphrosperm . These interactions were also influenced by changes in the climate , which pushed the belegs to move to different regions of the globe . Wang , Zhang , Li , Wu , Ying "

[ABSTRACT] Our methods shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology . Here , we leverage published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas , each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions . Using spatial metrics of evolution , we find that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume instead of at the surface . In growing cell populations such as tumours , mutations can serve as markers that allow tracking the past evolution from current samples . The genomic analyses of bulk samples and samples from multiple regions have shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on tumours . We determine how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth . However , little is known empirically on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution .
[INTRODUCTION] From the observed spatial distribution of mutations , it should in principle be possible to infer the spatio-temporal principles of tumour evolution : Is the growth rate uniform across the tumour , or does growth predominantly take place near the edge of the tumour ? As a result , under volume growth mutation frequencies evolve exactly in the same way they would do in a well-mixed population , even though the resulting tumour will generally be spatially heterogeneous ( see below ) . This implies a need for new tools to analyse spatio-temporal evolution , since standard tools of population genetics , like the site-frequency spectrum , are designed for spatially mixed populations and disregard spatial information . However , to answer such questions on the basis of genetic tumour data is challenging because only partial information is available : ( i ) The sequencing depth ( average number of reads covering a nucleotide in NGS sequencing ) is finite . In volume growth , on the other hand , cancer cells grow irrespective of their location in the tumour : although each cell has a physical location , and upon division its offspring is in a similar location , location does not affect cell division or death . However , it is clear that the coming-of-age of spatial genomics will bring new opportunities to understand the past evolution of a population of tumour cells from a late-stage snapshot . These broad modes of tumour evolution affect for instance the signature of neutral evolution , the response to selection , or the number of low-frequency mutants which can confer therapy resistance . In tumours , some evidence for surface growth comes from histological stainings , which show an enhanced level of the Ki-67 protein ( a cellular marker for proliferation ) near a tumour surface . The potential reasons for this spatial dependence include higher nutrient levels near normal tissue , higher levels of metabolic waste products in the tumour bulk , or mechanical stress in the tumour centre . ( ii ) Usually only a small number of samples are taken from different parts of a solid tumour , which limits the information on mutations present in the full tumour . To tell between these two different evolutionary dynamics , we use high-resolution data on the spatial distribution of mutations found in solid tumours . Mixed population models have been used extensively to
[RESULTS] Also , high values of the dispersion parameter can not arise spuriously due to positive selection , as selected clones would enter the population later than neutral ones ( given the same final frequency ) , and thus do not have as much time to be moved within the tumour . The reason is that in an exponentially growing population , late-stage mutations have frequencies too low to be detected : Under neutral evolution and neglecting fluctuations in clone sizes , the final frequency ( in the entire population ) of a mutation that arose when a tumour consisted of N cells is given by f=1/N . To quantify the spatial dispersion of a mutation , we define the dispersion parameter σ : For a given
[DISCUSSION] Future techniques to sequence resected tumours at higher spatial and genomic resolution than currently possible will allow to trace key later-stage evolutionary changes like angiogenesis , effects of the tumour microenvironment , or the development of genetic instability . Mutations might thus be present at low frequency in a particular sample , because the cells carrying it migrated from afar , rather than because the mutation either arose late during the growth of the tumour or was under negative selection . Instead , in its early stage , the tumour was balanced precariously between continued growth to macroscopic size and shrinkage : A small increase in the rate of cell death , or a small decrease in the growth rate would have caused the small net growth rate to become negative , possibly even leading to the extinction of the tumour . We found that this effect can be highly advantageous when assessing the mutations in a tumour from a limited number of
[METHODS] 23 of these samples were subjected to whole-exome sequencing ( average read depth of 74 reads per nucleotide ) , and loci with mutations found in these 23 samples were probed by genotyping ( by Sequenom and Sanger sequencing ) in all 285 samples . We implement the resolution of overlaps introduced by a cell division using a 'width-first ' pushing-algorithm ,",,938,95,None,"Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people worldwide . It is caused by mutations in the DNA of the cells that make up the tumour . The mutations can cause the tumour to grow , but it is not clear how the mutations are spread throughout the tumour and how they are dispersed throughout the tumor . To answer this question , the researchers have used a technique called spatial genomics to study the evolution of cancer cells . This technique uses a combination of high-resolution sequencing and high-throughput data to study how mutations spread across the tumour in a population . In the experiments , a number of samples were taken from a large number of tumours , each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions . These samples were then analysed to find out how the tumour cells grow and how the cells die . Using this information , they found that the tumour cell population grows largely uniformly within the tumour volume , rather than at the surface . However , in volume growth , cells die more often than in fewer samples , which suggests that these cells are more likely to die in the tumour than in the surrounding tissue . Furthermore , when the tumour is larger , it is more likely that the cells will die more quickly . Thus , this means that the cancer cells are less likely to grow at the edge of the tumour when they are in the same location as the surrounding tissues ."

[ABSTRACT] Furthermore , we demonstrated that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway , regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form . In summary , these findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor . Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor CcTRPM regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis by impacting cuticle content and thickness . In this study , we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis . Firstly , we identified CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β as two typical subunits of Bursicon in C. chinensis , which were regulated by low temperature ( 10 °C ) and CcTRPM . Finally , we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R , contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis . Subsequently , CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness . Cacopsylla chinensis exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism , specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form , which have distinct morphological phenotypes . Bursicon , also known as the tanning hormone , is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle . Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity . However , the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown .
[INTRODUCTION] These efforts not only shed light on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis , but also enhance our understanding of the neuroendocrine basis of insect seasonal polyphenism . Similarly , in the model insect Tribolium castaneum , RNA interference experiments have demonstrated that the Bursicon receptor ( Tcrk ) is not only required for cuticle tanning , but also crucial for the development and expansion of integumentary structures . Cacopsylla chinensis ( Yang & Li ) is a pear psylla belonging to the Hemiptera order , which causes severe damage to trees and fruits in the major pear production areas across East Asian countries , including China and Japan . Importantly , this pest demonstrates strong adaptability to its environment and exhibits seasonal polyphenism , manifesting as summer-form ( SF ) and winter-form ( WF ) , which display significant differences in morphological characteristics throughout the seasons . For instance , we observe seasonal polyphenism in psylla and butterflies , sexual and wing polyphenism in aphids and planthoppers , caste polyphenism in ants and honeybees , sex determination in reptiles and fish regulated by temperature and social factors , and environmentally induced polyphenism in plants . Interestingly , it has been reported that Bursicon homodimers can activate the NF-kB transcription factor Relish , leading to the induction of innate immune and stress genes during molting . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) , which are approximately 23 nucleotides in length and belong to a class of small noncoding RNAs , play a crucial role in the regulation of posttranscriptional gene expression . We then employed RNAi , cuticle staining , and transmission electron microscopy to study the effects of CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β on cuticle content , cuticle thickness , and the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis . In this study , we conducted bioinformatics analysis , qRT-PCR , and western blot to identify two Bursicon subunits ( CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β ) and their association with low temperature of 10 °C . demonstrated that a low temperature of 10 °C and the temperature receptor CcTRPM regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in
[RESULTS] The results showed that the mRNA levels of CcTre1 and CcCHS1 were obviously decreased in dsCcBurs-α , dsCcBurs-β , or dsCcBurs-R feeding nymphs on the sixth day compared to the control ( Figure 4I-J ) This data indicates that CcBurs-R functions up-stream of the chitin biosynthesis pathway and is involved in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis . To elucidate the association between these parameters and the cuticle tanning threshold , we investigated nymph phenotypes , cuticle pigment absorbance levels , and cuticle thickness in C. chinensis over varying time intervals ( 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 days ) under either 10 °C or 25 °C temperature
[DISCUSSION] In C. chinensis , cuticle pigment absorbance and cuticle thickness , both have an increasing trend over time under 10 °C conditions , and showed very high correlation with the nymph phenotype of cuticle tanning during the transition from summer-form to winter-form . Future research will focus on : ( 1 ) studying the combined effect of Bursicon with other neuro-hormones on the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis , ( 2 ) identifying the down-stream signaling of Bursicon in mediating this phenomenon through multi-omics and RNAi approaches . Moreover , the presence of both thin and thick chitin layers observed in the dsEGFP treatment of Figure 2D could potentially be ascribed to the chitin content in the insect midgut or fat body as previously discussed . Further results from RNAi-mediated knockdown of CcBurs-α , CcBurs-β , or both showed that Bursicon prominently regulates the transition from summer-form to
[METHODS] The relative gene expression was quantified using TB Green Premix Ex Taq II ( Tli RNaseH Plus ) ( Cat # RR820A , Takara , Kyoto , Japan ) or miRcute Plus miRNA qPCR Detection Kit ( Cat # FP411 , TIANGEN , Beijing , China ) in a total 20 μL reaction mixture on a",,983,97,None,"Animals can adapt to changes in their environment , such as changes in temperature , or changes in the size of their cuticles . This is called seasonal polyphenism , and it has been shown that insects have a strong ability to adapt to changing conditions . However , the mechanisms that underlie this adaptation remain largely unknown . For example , it is thought that the insect Bursicon , also known as the tanning hormone , is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle , which is made of chitin . Previous research has shown that the bursicles of insects are able to change from summer-form to winter-form , but it was not clear how this process is controlled . Now , Wang et al . have used a technique called microscopy to study the effects of two different types of insect bursicons , Bursis and Tcrk . The experiments show that the two types of insects have different patterns of growth and development , while the two forms have different morphological characteristics . These findings reveal a new role for Bursin in the process of forming the insect's body . In addition , they show that CcBurs-R , a protein that is found in many insects , plays an important role in regulating the growth of the insects' cuticels ."

[ABSTRACT] Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin , an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo , in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat , resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability . Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 ( H3-K27M ) is a driver mutation in DMGs , reshaping the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis . Finally , in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination . Moreover , transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR . Diffuse midline gliomas ( DMGs ) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments . In search of effective treatment , we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) and MYC in these tumors . H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways , as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway . These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors .
[INTRODUCTION] To address the increasing need for an effective combination therapy for H3-K27M DMGs , we tested whether dual targeting of histone acetylation and MYC activation , using Vorinostat and Sulfopin , would yield beneficial outcome . Years of clinical trials have revealed that conventional chemotherapy is ineffective , and with no option for complete resection , DMG is now the leading cause of brain tumor-related death in children . Specifically , pervasive H3K27 acetylation patterns observed in H3-K27M DMGs , along with enrichment of H3K27ac specifically on mutant nucleosomes , underscored the histone acetylation pathway as a potential drug target for this cancer . However , recent studies demonstrated that H3-K27M cells develop resistance to HDACi treatment , stressing the importance of identifying novel drug combinations to induce synergistic inhibition of oncogenic pathways . Indeed , pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi ) , such as Vorinostat and Panobinostat , were found to inhibit growth and to restore gene expression alterations observed in H3-K27M malignant gliomas . We show that the combined treatment substantially reduces viability of patient-derived glioma cells , in concordance with the inhibition of prominent oncogenic pathways , including the mTOR pathway . Sequencing studies showed that up to 80 % of the diagnosed children exhibit a lysine 27 to methionine ( H3-K27M ) mutation in one of the genes encoding histone H3 . Treatment of H3-K27M DMG xenograft mice models with this drug combination led to reduced tumor growth and confirmed downregulation of mTOR in vivo . H3-K27M gliomas show high expression of MYC and MYC target genes , due to both epigenetic alterations and structural variants , resulting in a viability dependency on MYC signaling . Dubiella et al. , 2021 have recently developed a unique inhibitor targeting peptidyl-prolyl isomerase NIMA-interacting-1 ( PIN1 ) , an upstream regulator of MYC activation ( ) . The PIN1 inhibitor , Sulfopin , was shown to downregulate MYC target genes in vitro and to block MYC-driven tumors in murine models of neuroblastoma . Among these global epigenetic alterations are a drastic loss of H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation ( H3K27me3 ) , concomitant with an increase in H3 lysine 27 acetylation ( H3K27ac ) . Detailed characterization of the modes of chromatin deregulation in these tumors pointed toward targeting epigenetic pathways as a promising therapeutic approach . Together ,
[RESULTS] H3-K27M cells were reported to be sensitive to EZH2 inhibition as they rely on the residual H3K27me3 levels to suppress key tumor suppressor genes ; ( 2 ) GSK-J4 , an inhibitor of the H3K27me3 demethylase JMJD3 , shown to rescue H3K27me3 levels in H3-K27M gliomas ; ( 3 ) MM-102 , an inhibitor of the H3K4me3 methyltransferase MLL1 , shown to reduce viability of H3-K27M-mutant cells ; and ( 4 ) Vorinostat , an HDACi that was shown to have clinical benefit in H3-K27M gliomas . Specifically , the combined treatment reduced H3K27ac levels on several enhancers linked to genes involved in mTOR pathway and gliomagenesis , such as AKT3 , JAK1 , and NFKB2 genes , that were shown
[DISCUSSION] While PIN1 is not overexpressed in DMG tumors , we show that Sulfopin , although not inhibiting MYC directly , downregulates MYC target genes in patient-derived DMG cells and affects cell survival in an H3-K27M-dependent manner . While treating cells with Vorinostat alone increased H3K27ac levels , as expected , the combined treatment attenuated the accumulation of this mark on promoters and enhancers of prominent oncogenes , resulting in their decreased expression . The high levels of H3K27ac in H3-K27M cells was also linked to activation of super-enhancers , which regulate the expression of oncogenes and genes that are associated with an undifferentiated state . However , emerging resistance to HDACi in glioma cells , as well as limited therapeutic benefits of HDACi treatment as a sole agent , highlight the necessity to discover additional therapy modalities that could prolong survival and relieve symptoms . Despite decades of efforts to improve treatment for children diagnosed with H3-K27M-mutant
[METHODS] The BLISS index was calculated as the ratio between observed effect of combined drug treatment and expected effect ( based on the calculated effect of combining single-drug treatment ) : Blissindex=Observed/Expected=JAB ( JA×JB ) An equal number of cells from different treatments were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 50 mM DTT , vortexed and heated up to 98°C .",,957,96,None,"The brain is made up of many different types of cells , including neurons , nerve cells and glial cells . These cells are known as midline gliomas , and they are the leading cause of brain tumors in children . However , it is not clear how these tumors develop , or how they are treated . In some cases , a mutation in one of the genes that encodes the histone H3 gene can lead to the development of a tumor . This mutation is called a histone acetylase , which is responsible for regulating the activity of many genes . It is also known as methylation , because it is a chemical that is used to change the structure of the nucleus . One of the most common mutations in glia is that it changes the shape of histones , making them more resistant to chemotherapy . To find out if a combination of drugs could be effective , Dubiella et al . used a technique called X-ray crystallography . The experiments showed that a drug called Sulfopin was able to reduce the growth of the tumors . Using this drug combination , the mice were treated with a mixture of two drugs , Vorinostat and Panobinostat , to reduce their growth . After treatment , these mice had a significantly reduced growth rate , suggesting that this combination could be a promising treatment for these aggressive tumors that are often difficult to treat ."

[ABSTRACT] For a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens , the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood by P. leucopus , Mus musculus , and Rattus norvegicus and adjusted for white cell concentrations . The white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus , a long-lived rodent , is a key reservoir in North America for agents of several zoonoses , including Lyme disease , babesiosis , anaplasmosis , and a viral encephalitis . LPS-treated P. leucopus , in contrast to mice and rats , also displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes . Deermice were distinguished from the mice and rats by LPS response profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages . The phenomenon was associated with comparatively reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors in the deermice . The results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and perhaps other animal reservoirs for agents of human disease . While persistently infected , this deermouse is without apparent disability or diminished fitness . These characteristics of P. leucopus were also noted in a Borrelia hermsii infection model .
[INTRODUCTION] Given the wide range of pathogenic microbes that deermice tolerate , we use the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) as the primary experimental treatment because the inflammation it elicits within a few hours has features common to different kinds of serious infections , not to mention severe burns and critical injuries . The focus was on the blood of these animals , not only because the distinctions between species in their transcriptional profiles were nearly as numerous for this specimen as for spleen and liver , but also because for ecological and immunological studies of natural populations of Peromyscus species blood is obtainable from captured-released animals without their sacrifice . The results inform future studies of Peromyscus species , not only with respect to microbial infections and innate immunity , but conceivably also determinants of longevity and resilience in the face of other stressors , such as toxic substances in the environment . The diverse tickborne pathogens ( and diseases ) for humans include the extracellular bacterium Borreliella burgdorferi ( Lyme disease ) , the intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum ( anaplasmosis ) , the protozoan Babesia microti ( babesiosis ) , and the Powassan flavivirus ( viral encephalitis ) . The potentially damaging action from neutrophil proteases and reactive oxygen species appeared to be mitigated in part in P. leucopus by proteins like secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor , encoded by Slpi , and superoxide dismutase 2 , encoded by Sod2 . As a species native to North America , P. leucopus is an advantageous alternative to the Eurasian-origin house mouse for study of natural variation in populations that are readily accessible . The abundance of P. leucopus across much of North America and its adaptation to a variety of environments , including urban areas and toxic waste sites , indicates successful adjustment to changing landscapes and climate . This main experiment was supplemented by a study of rats under the similar conditions , by an investigation of a different dose of LPS and duration of exposure in another group of deermice , and by analysis of deermice infected with a bacterium lacking LPS . We previously reported that a few hours after injection of LPS , P. leucopus and M. musculus had distinguishing profiles of differentially expressed genes ( DEG ) in the blood , spleen , and liver .
[RESULTS] In addition to the differences in Nos2 and Arg1 expression for typing macrophage and monocyte subpopulations , there are also the relative expressions of three other pairs of genes : ( 1 ) Il12 and Il10 , where a lower Il12/Il10 transcription ratio is more characteristic of alternatively activated or M2 type Murray , 2017 ; van Stijn et al. , 2015 ; ( 2 ) Akt1 and Akt2 , the genes for two proto-oncogene kinases , where the associations are Akt1 with M2-type and Akt2 with M1-type macrophages Arranz et al. , 2012 ; Vergadi et al. , 2017 ; and ( 3 ) CD14 and CD16 , or low affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor III , encoded by Fcgr3
[DISCUSSION] The combination of these two signaling events , that is one through surface TLR4 by LPS itself and another through intracellular PPR ( s ) by to-be-defined ERV products , manifested in mice and rats as a response profile that had features of both a response to a virus with type 1 interferon and ISGs and a response to a bacterial PAMP like LPS with acute phase reactants such as calprotectin and serum amyloid . While deermice may not be in the same longevity league as the naked mole-rat ( Heterocephalus glaber ) , which can live for over 30 years Oka et al. , 2023 , some features of naked mole-rat immunology are intriguingly similar to what we have observed for P. leucopus . Since humans are transmission dead-ends for B. burgdorferi and many other zoonotic agents in their life cycles , it is not surprising that human infections are generally more debilitating if not fatal than
[METHODS] The target CDS were as follows : Acod1 , Akt1 , Akt2 , Arg1 , Bcl3 , Camp , Ccl2 , Ccl3 , Ccl4 , Cd14 , Cd177 , Cd3d , Cd4 , Cd69 , Cd8 , Cfb , Cgas , Csf1 , Csf1r , Csf2 , Csf3 , Csf3r , Cx3cr1 , Cxcl1 , Cxcl10 , Cxcl2 , Cxcl3",,962,96,None,"The white-footed deermouse is a key reservoir for several diseases , including Lyme disease , babesiosis , and anaplasmosus . The white footed rodent is able to survive in the wild and is adapted to a variety of environments , such as urban areas and toxic waste sites . It is also able , however , to survive on its own , as it is unable to reproduce . In addition , it is also capable of surviving in the environment , which is largely due to its ability to survive . This is because the white-feet deer is prone to infection by many different pathogens . One of the most common tick-borne diseases is Lyme , caused by a bacteria called Peromyscus leucopus that can cause severe burns and critical injuries . However , the disease is not fatal , but it can be fatal if left untreated . To investigate this , Welch et al . used a technique called endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) to examine the blood of the white foot deer . After a few hours , welch and Welcher emailed the blood samples of three different species of the deer: Mus musculus , Rattus norvegicus and P . leucopus . These animals were then treated with LPS and found to have different responses to different types of infections . Interestingly , when the mice and rats were exposed to LPS for a short time , they were more likely to be infected with different kinds of bacteria . Further experiments showed that the mice were less likely to respond to the L"

[ABSTRACT] These results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals . Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7 . These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate . In humans , CASP3 and CASP7 recognize the same consensus motif DxxD , which is present in gasdermin E ( GSDME ) . In this study , we identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7 . Caspase ( CASP ) is a family of proteases involved in cleavage and activation of gasdermin , the executor of pyroptosis . This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate ( except mammalian ) CASP7 . In mammals , the key residue is conserved in non-primates ( e. g. , mouse ) but not in primates . However , human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7 . p10 contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination . The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear . However , mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME .
[INTRODUCTION] Structural and biochemical analyses reveal that HsCASP1/4 βIII/βIII ' sheet forms an exosite that interacts with the hydrophobic pocket of HsGSDMD-CT domain , rendering HsGSDMD cleavage independent of CASP recognition of the tetrapeptide motif FLTD . The residues that form the hydrophobic pocket of HsGSDMD-CT domain are not conserved in HsGSDME , suggesting that HsGSDME can not be cleaved by HsCASP1/4 via interaction with an exosite . Proteolytic cleavage of HsGSDM to remove the autoinhibitory CT domain enables the binding of the lipophilic NT fragment to the cell membrane , where the NT fragments oligomerize and form transmembrane pores to induce osmotic cell lysis . Historically , HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 , which are 54 % identical , are known to possess similar structure and share overlapping protein substrate repertoire , and are considered to have functionally redundant roles in regulating cell death . Although HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 exert almost indistinguishable proteolytic specificity to certain polypeptides , there exist functional differences between these two HsCASPs in cleaving some substrates . By a series of site-directed mutagenesis , we discovered a previously unrecognized key residue ( S234 in HsCASP7 ) in p10 that was responsible for the discriminative cleavage of HsGSDME by HsCASP7 . Mutation of either the Asp residue of the DMPD tetrapeptide motif leads to cleavage resistance of HsGSDME , indicating that HsCASP3-mediated HsGSDME activation paradigm is distinct from that of HsGSDMD . Active HsCASP3/7 cleave a series of protein substrates , including poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase and DNA fragmentation factor 45 , which causes chromatin fragmentation and leads to apoptosis . HsCASP3/7 contain highly conserved QACRG and SHG motifs in p20 subunit , and SWR and GSWF motifs in p10 subunit , which participate in the catalytic reaction and substrate binding , respectively . GSDM forms transmembrane pores to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane , which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and , if these transmembrane pores persist , pyroptosis . Both HsCASP3 and HsCASP7 consist of two polypeptide subunits named p20 and p10 ( 1:1 ratio ) , which assemble to form active heterotetramer . Actually , human HsGSDME is specifically cleaved by HsCASP3 at the consensus motif DMPD , which is required for HsCASP3-mediated HsGSDME proteolysis . It is intriguing that although HsCASP7 shares the same
[RESULTS] In mammals , the corresponding Asn is present in most non-primate species , such as mouse ( Mus musculus ) and bovine ( Bos taurus ) , but is replaced by Ser in primate , such as humans ( Homo sapiens ) , gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla ) , and chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) ( Figure 6E , Figure 6-figure supplement 1 ) . The mutation results showed that , similar to the wild type , the mutant Q276W & D278E & H283S was unable to cleave HsGSDME ( Figure 5G ) , suggesting that , unlike human GSDMD , HsGSDME cleavage by CASPs probably did not involve exosite interaction . Compared with wild type HsGSDME and TrGSDME
[DISCUSSION] Since , unlike non-mammalian vertebrates , mammals possess multiple pyroptotic GSDM members ( GSDMA , B , C , D , and E ) , the functional divergence of CASP7 from CASP3 may have occurred as a result of specific and non-redundant regulation of programmed cell death mediated by different executor molecules . In this study , we found that different from human GSDME , a pufferfish GSDME belonging to the teleost GSDMEa lineage was specifically cleaved by both CASP3 and CASP7 at the site of DAVD to liberate the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment . Different from GSDMD , we found that for TrGSDME , mutation of either the P4 ( D255 ) or P1 ( D258 ) residue of the consensus motif 255DAVD258 made it resistant to CASP3/7 , implying a lack of DAVD-independent cleavage mechanism . In tongue sole ( Cynoglossus semilaevis ) , GSDMEb is preferably cleaved by CASP1 to trigger pyroptosis
[METHODS] To examine cell death morphology , propidium iodide ( PI ) ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and DiO ( Solarbio , Beijing , China ) were added to the culture medium , and the cells were observed with a Carl Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) . To compare their",,970,97,None,"Caspase is a family of enzymes that cleaves a protein called gasdermin , which is essential for the production of pyroptosis . The enzymes work by cleaving a variety of proteins , including DNA fragments , proteins and other molecules . However , it is not clear how these proteins are able to be reactivated . In mammals , a group of proteins called caspases are involved in the synthesis of proteins and a key part of the process is the cleation of the protein . This process involves a process known as cleaching a specific protein , called gasodermin E . Gasdermin E is made up of two proteins: one called CASP3/7 and one called HsCASP7 . Both proteins are known to have similar structures , but it is unclear how these two proteins work together . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called mutagenesis to identify a new amino acid called S234 in the CASP7 protein that is required for the lysis of gasdermine E in pufferfish . Using this technique , the researchers found that the residues that form the exosite of HsGSDMD-CT domain of gasDERMIN E are conserved in humans and in most vertebrate species . These findings suggest that the two proteins have different roles in the process of removing a certain protein molecule from the cell membrane ."

[ABSTRACT] We found that : ( i ) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional , reflecting robust inter-individual variability ; ( ii ) ketamine 's data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin ( SST ) and parvalbumin ( PVALB ) cortical gene expression patterns in humans , while the mean effect did not ; and ( iii ) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine , which were resolvable at the single-subject level . We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity and related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets . However , inter-individual variability in response to ketamine is still not well understood and it is unclear how ketamine 's molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects . These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine . They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry .

[INTRODUCTION] In addition , we investigate the extent to which multi-dimensionality is a property specific to ketamine by directly comparing ketamine to two other psychoactive substances that have also shown preliminary clinical efficacy for the treatment of depression , but have very different pharmacological profiles : ( i ) psilocybin , a preferential 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A agonist ; and ( ii ) LSD , which stimulates a wide range of serotonin and dopamine receptors . SST and PVALB genes were selected a-priori based on : ( i ) the large body of animal literature directly linking SST and PVALB interneurons to ketamine 's acute effects ; ( ii ) studies showing SST and PVALB interneurons are particularly sensitive to ketamine as a result of their NMDA receptor subunit configuration ; ( iii ) previous research showing that specific cortical regions express different ratios of SST and PVALB interneurons , with SST showing higher expression levels in association relative to sensory regions , while PVALB shows the reverse pattern ; and ( iv ) studies demonstrating patients with depression show reduced SST or PVALB interneurons in areas such as the hippocampus and PFC . Given that many different genes show similar spatial patterns in the brain , with the most common pattern explaining approximately 25 % of the total gene expression variance , it is important to note that by relating ketamine 's neural effects to SST and PVALB cortical gene expression patterns we do not make any claims regarding gene specificity . More specifically , a PCA allows us to test the hypothesis that ketamine 's effects are multi-dimensional : if ketamine 's effects are uniform then we would expect a PCA to result in one principal component on which all the participants can be mapped ; however if there are systemic differences between participants , we would anticipate a PCA to generate multiple principle components . For example , a single ketamine infusion results in a response rate of around 65 % in patients with TRD , while individual differences
[RESULTS] The loading configuration of the behavioral measures that form each PC shows that behavioral PC1 indexes variation particularly in the regards to : ( i ) negative-symptom items such as blunted affect , emotional withdrawal , social withdrawal , abstract thought , and lack of spontaneity ; ( ii ) the positive-symptom item conceptual disorganisation ; and ( iii ) general-symptom items such as tension , motor retardation , poor attention , and lack of insight and judgement ( Figure 4D ) . This resulted in two bi-directional neuro-behavioral PCs that are interpretable in relation to behavior : neuro-behavioral PC1 demonstrates that a high positive behavioral
[DISCUSSION] A third possibility is that the multiple bi-directional PCs may be driven by ketamine 's numerous microcircuit level targets , as ketamine effects : ( i ) SST interneurons , which in turn disinhibit glutamatergic pyramidal distal dendrites and PVALB interneurons ; ( ii ) PVALB interneurons , which disinhibit the soma of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons ; ( iii ) VIP neurons , which may reduce distal dendrite inhibition but disinhibit SST activity ; and ( iv ) chandelier cells , which permit the back-propagation of action potentials from the axon to the soma Anderson et al. , 2020 . Furthermore , we demonstrated that neuro-behavioral PC1 captured individual variation in how SST and PVALB interneurons may be differentially impacted by ketamine : we found an association between participants ' neuro-behavioral PC1 scores and whether their Δ
[METHODS] In order to be eligible to receive ketamine , participants were required to meet the following set of criteria , as determined by a detailed telephone interview and an in-person clinical assessment : ( i ) Age 21-60 ; ( ii ) IQ > 70 as measured via Wide Range Achievement Test",,1018,99,None,"Many people suffer from depression , but it is not clear how the brain responds to the drug . For example , some people have a disorder called depression that affects their mood , which can lead to a variety of symptoms .

It is also thought to be a powerful drug that can help people with depression to cope with their symptoms , such as anxiety , depression and anxiety . But it is still unclear how ketamine affects people’s brains and how it interacts with other drugs . To address this question , Heffter Research Institute ( FXV , KHP ) and Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation ( Usona Institute ) have conducted a study to find out how different types of brain activity affect the brain’s response to the medication . The experiments showed that the brains of healthy volunteers were more likely to respond to ketamine than healthy volunteers , and that these differences were linked to differences in how they responded to the treatment . These findings suggest that the effects of the drug on the brain are complex , with different brain regions responding differently to the same drug , while the effects on other brain regions are different . This suggests that a better understanding of how a drug works will help clinicians to better understand how the drug works . In addition , the results suggest that it is important to consider how different brain areas respond to different drugs , as well as how they interact with each other ."

[ABSTRACT] We find that large population sizes and small differences in the replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species ( 'genes ' ) , while the error threshold problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification . Stochastic parabolic growth could thus have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes . In addition , sequence properties ( GC content ) and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants , suggesting that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation . Here , we test the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under the constraints of constant total population size and chemostat conditions . The RNA world hypothesis proposes that during the early evolution of life , primordial genomes of the first self-propagating evolutionary units existed in the form of RNA-like polymers . Autonomous , non-enzymatic , and sustained replication of such information carriers presents a problem , because product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication speed . Kinetics of growth is then parabolic with the benefit of entailing competitive coexistence , thereby maintaining diversity .
[INTRODUCTION] While the latter models considerably improved the parabolic replication model framework in terms of its potential to incorporate evolvability , they did not account for the copying error threshold of their respective systems ; i. e. , an error rate of the replication mechanism at which the system 's ability to stably propagate genetic information from generation to generation is prohibited , resulting in irreversible loss of sequence-coded information . If enzyme-free replication of oligomers with a high degree of sequence variability was indeed attainable from prebiotic chemistry , then it becomes a vital issue how a critical level of diversity of the associated genetic information could be preserved under competition among distinct replicator types with different competitive abilities ( e. g. replicabilities ) . A potentially promising suggestion is that prior to template replication of complex polymers catalyzed by an RNA polymerase ribozyme ( i. e. replicase ) , genetic information and catalytic functions were initially distributed among short sequence modules that could occasionally be ligated to increase molecular complexity in a stepwise manner . Current knowledge of nucleotide chemistry as well as a large body of indirect evidence from recent organisms support the RNA world hypothesis ; a concept that once RNA fulfilled the role of an evolvable primordial informational polymer and biochemical reaction catalyst at the same time . For example , it has been experimentally demonstrated that activated oligonucleotides can act as catalysts for non-enzymatic replication of RNA containing all four nucleotides , with the fidelity sufficient to sustain a genome size large enough to encode active ribozymes . We further demonstrate that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates assumed for template-directed , enzyme-free replication , thereby proposing a simple biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in hypothetical information storage systems of the RNA world . In order for our stochastic simulation results to be comparable with the theoretical error threshold of parabolic dynamics , we analytically calculate the equilibrium master ( i. e. fittest sequence ) concentrations as a function of the copying fidelity and the reproductive superiority of the master sequences relative to the mutants . Moreover , practically no study is known to have treated parabolic replication so that physicochemical details and ecological constraints , together with stochastic effects ( that supposedly also have
[RESULTS] Our analytical results show that in this simple model ‒ except for Q=0 , where Q denotes the probability of the error-free replication of a master sequence ‒ there is no error threshold : the master type will persist at any level of mutation rate ( Figure 5 , right panel ) . For analytic tractability , we assume infinite population size and a single peak replication landscape in which a single genotype has high replication rate , all others have the same baseline value , the ratio of these two values ( denoted by A ) is the reproductive superiority . By contrast , in non-parabolic dynamics ( i. e. in the Eigen model , referred to as
[DISCUSSION] Such studies may help gain a deeper insight into the question whether the emergence of an effective strand separation mechanism , or other conditions implying kinetic constants that shift the dynamics toward exponential amplification , allowed for a still sub-exponential diversity-maintaining mechanism during later phases of chemical evolution and thus a gradual evolutionary transition from non-enzymatic replication to ribozyme-aided amplification . As we have demonstrated , template-directed , non-enzymatic replication of oligomer modules leading to parabolic growth profiles is an effective genetic information maintaining mechanism which may thus have constituted an indispensable bridge from the very first abiotic synthetic pathways for RNA to a ribozyme-dominated stage of the RNA world . Although short oligonucleotides like those we have investigated in the present study are not characteristically prone to intramolecular 2D folding and therefore typically bear with limited catalytic activities , miniribozymes with surprisingly short sequence lengths can still catalyze a wide variety of chemical reactions
[METHODS] The algorithm randomly chooses a reaction to take place , based on a propensity function that is specified for every μ reaction channel as : ( 12 ) αμ ( t ) =hμcμ , where μ=1 , … , M , and M is the number of possible reaction channels , cμ denotes the corresponding rate constant , hμ",,963,97,None,"DNA is made up of many different molecules , each with its own unique characteristics . Each of these molecules can be used to make proteins , or they can be copied into other molecules to make new proteins . This process is known as parabolic growth , and it has been suggested that this process could have been used to preserve genetic information in the early evolution of life . However , it is not clear how this process works . The RNA world hypothesis is based on the idea that the genomes of the first self-propagating organisms existed in the form of RNA-like polymers . It is believed that these polymers were created by a process called RNA replication , which is thought to have evolved during the early evolutionary stages of life and was responsible for the development of the human genome . Now , Wang et al . have tested this hypothesis in a stochastic model of the RNA production system . In the model , the population size of the organisms is constant , but the number of replicated genes is small . Wang also found that , under the conditions of constant population size , most of the replicator species are stable , while the error threshold problem is alleviated by exponential amplification of the replication rate . These results suggest that parabolism could have played a crucial role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early development of functional ribozymes ."

[ABSTRACT] Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites , and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1 . Here , we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 ( TRMT1 ) , a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs . These findings provide evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection . The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells . Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications , consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5 . Nonstructural protein 5 ( Nsp5 ) is the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication . Compared to wild-type human cells , TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA .
[INTRODUCTION] A cross-coronavirus investigation from the same group has extended this observation by finding that TRMT1 interacts with a catalytic-inactive version of Nsp5 encoded by SARS-CoV-1 , which is 98 . These studies uncover TRMT1 as a novel proteolytic cleavage target of Nsp5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest possible pathological mechanisms associated with perturbations in TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications . The maturation step to release the individual Nsp polypeptides is executed by two viral-encoded proteases : Nsp5 ( also known as Main Protease , MPro/3C-like protease ) and Nsp3 ( also known as Papain-Like Protease , PLPro ) . In a recent study , Chikungunya RNA virus infection has been shown to increase the expression of a human tRNA modification enzyme and alter tRNA modification patterns to favor viral protein expression . Moreover , analysis of RNA extracted from human nose swabs have identified tRNA profiles and modification signatures associated with mild versus severe COVID-19 . TRMT1 is a tRNA modification enzyme that catalyzes the formation of dimethylguanosine ( m2 , 2G ) at position 26 in more than half of all human tRNAs . The putative interaction between Nsp5 and TRMT1 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection could affect the function of TRMT1 with consequent effects on tRNA modification levels . Once delivered into the host cell , the incoming positive-strand viral RNA genome is first translated by host ribosomes into two overlapping polyproteins , pp1a and pp1ab . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is an enveloped , single-stranded RNA virus that is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic . Besides cleaving viral substrates , Nsp3 and Nsp5 have also been found to cleave endogenous host proteins linked to the immune response and cell survival . The change in tRNA modification profiles could represent another mechanism employed by SARS-CoV-2 to take over translation in addition to previously described strategies . Viral polyproteins are then proteolytically processed into 16 mature nonstructural proteins ( Nsps ) involved in the assembly of the viral replication-transcription complex . SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family , which includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 ( SARS-CoV-1 ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) . In one well-known example , retroviruses such as HIV use cellular tRNAs as primers for reverse transcription and other viral functions . Purification of individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins
[RESULTS] In addition , using an antibody against the FLAG tag , we could detect a ~20 kDa product matching the expected molecular weight of a FLAG-tagged C-terminal TRMT1 cleavage product in the lysate of human cells expressing Nsp5 but not vector alone or Nsp5-C145A ( Figure 4A , FLAG , arrowhead ) . As expected , the m2 , 2G modification was absent in tRNA‐Met‐CAU and mt-tRNA-Ile-UAU isolated from the vector‐transfected TRMT1‐KO cell line leading to read‐through to the next RT block ( Figure 5E , lane 6 ) . Consistent with this observation , increased expression of full-length TRMT1 or variants in control 239T cells had no detectable effect on m2 , 2G modification in tRNA‐Met‐CAU or mt-tRNA-Ile-UAU ( Figure 5E , lanes
[DISCUSSION] The packaging of specific tRNAs in viral particles could augment viral translation in the subsequent round of infection , thereby enhancing infectivity and perhaps facilitating the species jump of SARS-CoV-2 towards hosts with incompatible codon bias . Our findings suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 might self-limit its replication by altering the host translation machinery through TRMT1 degradation and reduced levels of m2 , 2G-modified tRNAs . This perturbation of the tRNA pool may further inhibit host translation that is already targeted by Nsp1 blockade of mRNA entry on 40 S ribosomes . The observation that expression of the non-cleavable TRMT1-Q530N variant enhances viral replication and infectivity supports the hypothesis that TRMT1 could facilitate tRNA uptake into viral particles . The inhibition of host translation may be beneficial to certain viruses that can locally maintain a tRNA pool optimized for viral translation . Another possibility is that Nsp5-TRMT1 interaction facilitates the packaging of specific tRNAs into viral particles as suggested previously .
[METHODS] To measure RNA levels , the amplification reaction was run on a LightcyclerR 480 thermocycler ( Roche Diagnostics ) using the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR kit ( New England Biolabs ) with the following primers : Each qPCR was performed in triplicate , and the means and standard deviations were calculated . Absolute quantification of data obtained from RT-qPCR was used",,950,96,None,"Many viruses , including SARS-CoV-2 , cause severe acute respiratory syndrome ( COVID-19 ) , a disease that affects millions of people worldwide . The virus is transmitted to the body via the bloodstream , and it is transmitted by the immune system to the host . When the virus is infected , the virus carries out a series of steps that help it to replicate . This process involves a protein called nonstructural protein 5 ( Nsp5 ) that binds to and cleaves the viral protein into individual polypeptides that are needed for the virus to replicate in the host cell . Nspp5 is a protease that is involved in the assembly of the viral proteins . Infection with SARS–cov-2 causes the virus’s genome to be altered . However , it is not clear how this changes the structure of the protein , or how it affects the viral replication . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called DNA sequencing to find out what happens when the virus infects the human body . They found that a single mutation in the sequence of Nsq5 inhibited the activity of the enzyme , which is responsible for cleaving the protein into the correct shape . These findings suggest that the protein can be damaged by the virus itself , as well as by other factors , such as the presence of a mutation in its protein sequence . Wang also found that the mutations in the protein sequence could also affect the ability of the virus's protein to repair itself . Further experiments showed that Nssp1 , an enzyme that is required for the formation of methylguanosine ( m2 , 2G ) in human tRNAs , was able"

[ABSTRACT] One hypothesis posits that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence , or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host . The existence of microbes whose life cycle does not require a host and are not normally pathogenic , yet are well-suited to host exploitation , is an evolutionary puzzle . Along with plastic adherence , two multicellular phenotypes- biofilm formation and flor formation- increased ; another phenotype , pseudohyphal growth , responded to the nutrient limitation . To experimentally test the idea of 'accidental virulence ' , replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evolved to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations . Our results support the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic , 'accidental ' pathogens . Wax moth larvae injected with evolved hyper-multicellular strains were significantly more likely to die than those injected with evolved non-multicellular strains . Many disease-causing microbes are not obligate pathogens ; rather , they are environmental microbes taking advantage of an ecological opportunity . Hence , selection on plastic adherence incidentally led to the evolution of enhanced multicellularity and increased virulence . Thus , experimental selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent , hyper-multicellular strains . An example of such a trait is surface adherence .
[INTRODUCTION] The dual-use virulence traits that can be under 'coincidental selection ' and lead to 'accidental virulence ' are numerous and range from toxin production , such as the production of gliotoxin in the soil-dwelling filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus , to protective structures , such as capsule formation in C. neoformans . In both the bacterial and eukaryotic literature , there has been less focus on the role of selection imposed by the abiotic environment , although temperature is increasingly a consideration , as thermotolerance and halotolerance may make colonization in and on humans more likely . Aside from serving as a model for genetics and cell biology , and being found in a myriad of ecological niches around the globe , S. cerevisiae is also an opportunistic pathogen capable of infecting immunocompromised individuals , with reports of infections increasing . In the research presented here , rather than altering the biotic or abiotic environment and determining the effect on virulence , we apply direct selection to a specific trait hypothesized to be dual-use in the biomedical model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The study of infectious disease often focuses on pathogenic microbes that either specialize in exploiting animal hosts or act as commensals that switch to pathogenesis when the delicate balance between host and microbe is perturbed . The existence of virulence traits in environmentally-derived opportunistic pathogens may be due to selection favoring the traits for other uses in the non-host environment , which challenges the idea that co-evolution is a requirement of microbial pathogenesis and virulence . However , there exists a broad range of microbial organisms that live in the open environment ( i. e. soil , vegetation , aquatic habitats ) that are capable of causing disease when the opportunity presents itself . A hypothesis similar to coincidental selection , known as 'accidental virulence ' , has been proposed and explored in parallel in the eukaryotic microbial literature , also with a focus on the biotic environment . For example , in the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans , traits that protect from predatory amoeba also play a role in human infection , and selection by amoeba can increase the prevalence of such traits . Despite overlap in conserved signaling and regulatory networks governing the traits , the ability of a strain to
[RESULTS] A genome-wide investigation into the genetic basis of three multicellular phenotypes ( biofilm formation , PSH , and invasive growth ) in a lab strain of S. cerevisiae found that each phenotype appeared to have its own set of hundreds of genes underlying its expression , but also some overlap in select transcription factors and signaling pathways . Different batches of larvae can be variable in their response to microbial insult ; therefore , to ensure reproducibility of results , the experiment was repeated multiple times with numerous batches of larvae , with each batch being challenged by all strains from a genetic background . In YJM311 , the loadings of the first two components , which explain 78
[DISCUSSION] Warmer water temperatures and climate disruptions have been linked to the incidence of illness caused by the marine bacterium Vibrio vulnificus , and an increase in global temperature has been hypothesized to be related to the simultaneous emergence of C. auris infections on multiple continents . Furthermore , in its long evolutionary history , S. cerevisiae has evolved the genetic capability to express multiple different multicellular phenotypes , most of which are induced in nutrient limiting conditions ; the experiment presented here was performed in such conditions ( glucose limited medium ) . Clinically relevant strains of Escherichia coli can use microplastics in the environment as a reservoir and can even become more virulent after recovery from the 'plastisphere ' , and it has been shown that plastics in the environment may harbor other pathogenic taxa . Previous research on a panel of environmental isolates found no correlation between the phenotypes assayed here , and

However , it is not clear whether this is the case . In the past , scientists have been interested in the role of selection in the environmental environment , and this has led to the discovery of a trait called plastic adherence . This trait is a key component of the bacterium’s life cycle , so it can be used as a model to study how bacteria evolve and develop . Now , Wang et al . have used a technique called direct selection to test this theory . The experiments show that the bacteria evolved to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations . When the bacteria were injected with the plastic , they were more likely to die than the non-successful strains . Wang also found that the polymerization of the plastic was a factor in the evolution of the polymers . These results suggest that selection may favor traits that are beneficial in the open environment or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host ."

[ABSTRACT] Here , we exploit the accuracy of our residue-resolution coarse-grained model , Mpipi , to quantify the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins ( hnRNPA1 , TDP43 , FUS , EWSR1 , RBM14 , and TIA1 ) . These rules are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend across the entire family tested , suggesting that scaling laws can be used as tools to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates . Proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains ( PLDs ) are common drivers of the formation of biomolecular condensates and are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations . Our simulations reveal the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations . Our work offers a quantitative lens into how the emergent behavior of PLD solutions vary in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules .
[INTRODUCTION] In the context of polymer-like systems such as IDPs , scaling laws have offered invaluable insight into vastly different aspects of their physical behavior : for example , they were instrumental in determining that the relationship between viscosity and radius of gyration in polymer solutions is described by a power law between the two quantities Dunstan , 2019 ; demonstrating that aging scaling during polymer collapse is a universal property in homopolymers Majumder et al. , 2020 ; determining that in single polymer systems , their end-to-end distance is directly proportional to their length Rubinstein and Colby , 2003 ; showing that foldable sequences with more compact unfolded states are recent products of protein evolution . In the context of protein condensates , we hypothesized that scaling laws , if found , may allow us to quantify how condensates respond to different intrinsic perturbations-such as amino acid mutations or presence/absence of different post-translational modifications , changes in protein length , increased/decreased flexibility-or external stimuli-such as changes to the pH of the medium or the ionic environment . Furthermore , the PLDs of various naturally occurring proteins , such as Fused in Sarcoma ( FUS ) , Trans-activation response DNA-binding protein 43 ( TDP-43 ) , and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 ( hnRNPA1 ) have been reported to transition from liquid-like condensates into dynamically arrested solids and glasses over time . The scaling laws presented in this study serve two purposes : first , to verify the generality of the molecular grammar that governs the phase behavior across various PLD proteins , and second , to quantify the extent to which the critical solution temperature of a PLD protein solution will change in response to specific amino acid sequence changes . Thus , we focused on determining if such laws exist for PLDs by exploring six different RNA-binding proteins ( i. e. hnRNPA1 , TDP43 , FUS , EWSR1 , RBM14 , and TIA1 ; Figure 1A and B ) , linked to the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders through pathology and genetics . We reveal that the changes in the critical solution temperatures of PLDs , as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations ( e. g. aromatic , positively charged , etc ) , can indeed be quantified by scaling laws , which are conserved across the family of PLDs we investigate
[RESULTS] Finally , we define a third scaling law , ( 3 ) ΔTc=SX1→X2NX1→X2L where the change in critical solution temperature is hypothesized to be directly proportional to the number of mutations ( NX1→X2 ) but inversely linear to L. Like our second scaling law , this third relationship also presumes that longer PLDs form condensates with critical parameters that are less affected by mutations than shorter PLDs . Here , we perform residue-resolution coarse-grained MD simulations ( see Figure 1C , with further details in the Methods section ) with our Mpipi model to quantitatively compare the critical parameters of a total of 140 mutants of the PLDs of TDP-43 , FUS , EWSR1 , hnRNPA1 , RBM14 , and TIA1 ( Figure 1A
[DISCUSSION] This relationship implies that each mutation of Arg to Lys exerts a substantially more destabilizing effect than mutations of Arg to other uncharged , non-aromatic residues , consistent with experimental evidence and highlighting the significant , modulatory role Lys plays in the phase behavior of PLDs . The scaling law for such aromatic deletions ( 56K/L ) predicts that the destabilizing effect of replacing an aromatic with a non-aromatic residue is linearly amplified by the number of such mutations and screened by the square root of the length of the protein ( L ) , indicating a disruption in the percolated network of interactions sustaining the condensate . In this study , we exploit the accuracy and efficiency of our protein model , Mpipi , to compute and analyze the temperature-vs-density phase diagrams of a large set of PLDs-140 variants of the PLDs of proteins hnRNPA1 , TDP43 , FUS , EWSR1 , RBM14 , and TIA1 . While it may
[METHODS] Using these tests , we confirm that the phase diagrams computed for systems of varying sizes ( 27 , 64 , 125 and 216 chains ) exhibit no significant difference in predicted densities ( see Appendix 1-figure 8 ) . To efficiently handle this , we implement a robust , tiered , data storage and retrieval system , ensuring that the",,947,96,None,"Proteins contain prion-like low complexity domains ( PLDs ) , which are a group of proteins that are known to form condenses . These proteins are made up of a small number of amino acids , called amino acids that can change the shape of the protein . This changes the temperature of the solution of the PLD protein , and it is thought that these changes can affect how the protein reacts to changes in the environment . However , it is not clear how these changes affect the stability of these proteins . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a mathematical model to study how the stability and stability of PLD proteins change over time . The model was able to simulate the changes in temperature of pDs of six different proteins , including hnRNPA1 , TDP43 , FUS , EWSR1 and TIA1 . Wang also found that the temperature at which the protein solution changes depends on the number of mutations in the amino acid sequence . In particular , the temperature that the solution changes at depends on how many amino acids are present in the protein: for example , if there are more than one amino acid , then the solution will change at a higher temperature than if it had been previously altered . Moreover , when the number and type of amino acid mutations are present , this temperature changes , so the solution is more stable . Furthermore , while the temperature changes at the same time as the number or type of mutation in the proteins remained the same , there was a difference in how the temperature changed between the two groups of proteins compared to the ones that had been altered , such as if they had been modified .

[ABSTRACT] We here propose an approach that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) and combines it with the Fisher kernel , which can be used to predict individual traits . One reason why these dynamic patterns are not usually considered is that they have to be described by complex , high-dimensional models ; and it is unclear how best to use these models for prediction . Our approach leverages information about an individual 's time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalised medicine . This is commonly done using either structural aspects , such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness , or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time . But these approaches are missing a central aspect of brain function : the unique ways in which an individual 's brain activity unfolds over time . We compare the Fisher kernel to other prediction methods , both time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models . Predicting an individual 's cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience . We show here , in fMRI data , that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach is accurate and reliable . The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner , thereby preserving the structure of the underlying model .
[INTRODUCTION] We focus on models of brain dynamics that capture within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from fMRI scans , in this case acquired during wakeful rest , and how the parameters from these models can be used to predict behavioural variables or traits . Second , predictions should be reliable , in the sense that a predictive model should never produce excessively large errors , and the outcome should be robust to reasonable variations in the data set , for example the choice of which subjects from the same population are included in the training set . However , although research into brain dynamics has recently gained traction , it is still unclear how best to use this spatiotemporal level of description to characterise subject differences or predict individual traits from brain signals . One reason why brain dynamics are not usually considered in this context pertains to their representation : They are represented using models of varying complexity that are estimated from modalities such as functional MRI or MEG . Although there exists a variety of methods for estimating time-varying or dynamic FC , like the commonly used sliding-window approach , there is currently no widely accepted way of using them for prediction problems . In summary , we show that using the Fisher kernel approach , which preserves the mathematical structure of the underlying HMM , we can predict individual traits from patterns of brain dynamics accurately and reliably . HMMs have previously been shown to be able to predict certain complex subject traits , such as fluid intelligence , more accurately than structural or static ( time-averaged ) FC representations . The same should apply at the brain level , where we may be able to gain crucial insights by observing the patterns in which brain activity unfolds over time , that is brain dynamics . This defines , for instance , the relation between parameters , such as : how changing one parameter , like the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another , would affect the fitting of other parameters , like the states ' FC . We show that our approach significantly outperforms methods that do not take the mathematical structure of the model into account , as well as methods based
[RESULTS] Using the resting-state fMRI timeseries from the HCP dataset , we found that among the kernels constructed from HMMs , the linear Fisher kernel had the highest prediction accuracy on average across the range of behavioural variables and CV folds and iterations , as shown in Figure 2a . Consistent with the results in Vidaurre et al. , 2021 , for all kernels , both linear and Gaussian versions , the separation of training and test subjects before vs. after fitting the HMM had no significant effects on prediction accuracies ( training together vs. separate : linear Fisher kernel : tkCV = 0 , pBH = 1 ; Gaussian Fisher kernel : tkCV = 0 , pBH =

Here , improving the description of individual variability in brain measures may have potential benefits for a variety of clinical goals , for example to diagnose or predict individual patients ' outcomes , find biomarkers , or to deepen our understanding of changes in the brain related to treatment responses like drugs or non-pharmacological therapies . Our proposed approach provides one avenue of addressing this by leveraging individual patterns of time-varying amplitude and FC , as one of many possible descriptions of brain dynamics , and

One way to predict how the brain works is to use brain signals to measure how much activity the brain receives . This is called a Hidden Markov model .

They can also be used for predicting how long an individual has been awake , which is important for determining whether a patient is at risk of developing a disease . Wang fMRI data showed that the Fisher kernel was able to predict the brain activity of an individual more accurately than other methods . In addition , Fisher kernel predictions were more accurate than other models , suggesting that Fisher kernel prediction could be useful in predicting individual traits in a population ."

[ABSTRACT] While it has been recently shown that perturbations in cellular homeostasis including lysosomal damage can increase LRRK2 activity and localization to lysosomes , the molecular mechanisms by which LRRK2 activity is regulated have remained poorly defined . Together , these data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12 , in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants , facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrate ( s ) at the lysosome . Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes , we demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes and leads to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation . PD-linked variants , including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N , lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10 . We performed a targeted siRNA screen to identify regulators of LRRK2 activity and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates , Rab10 . Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) variants associated with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and Crohn 's disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates .
[INTRODUCTION] Rab29 and the retromer subunit VPS35 , proteins that are genetically associated with PD and play key roles in lysosomal function by regulating sorting between the endolysosomal system and the trans-Golgi network , can modulate LRRK2 activity , as overexpression of Rab29 or expression of the pathogenic VPS35 D620N variant lead to significantly elevated LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and other Rab substrates . However , it is not clear what mechanisms promote the initial recruitment of LRRK2 to membranes to trigger Rab phosphorylation or whether increased LRRK2 membrane association is a common driver of the elevated LRRK2 activity observed in PD . Several hypotheses around the purpose of LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes have been proposed , including promotion of lysosomal membrane repair or clearance of lysosomal content through exocytosis or sorting of vesicles away from damaged lysosomes . The majority of pathogenic LRRK2 variants cluster within its Roc-COR ( Ras of complex proteins/C-terminal of Roc ) GTPase tandem domain or kinase domain and contribute to disease risk by ultimately increasing LRRK2 's kinase activity . Recent work suggests that interactions between LRRK2 and its phosphorylated Rab substrates help maintain LRRK2 on membranes and result in a cooperative , feed-forward mechanism to promote additional Rab phosphorylation . LRRK2 kinase activity also appears to be increased in nonhereditary idiopathic PD patients , and emerging data suggest that lysosomal damage more broadly may be a common trigger for LRRK2 activation . Together , our data delineate a conserved mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is regulated basally and in response to lysosomal damage and genetic variants associated with disease . Lysosomotropic agents that disrupt the endolysosomal pH gradient or puncture lysosomal membranes enhance LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes and result in increased Rab10 phosphorylation . LRRK2 localizes primarily to the cytosol in an inactive state , and higher-order oligomerization and membrane recruitment appear to be required for LRRK2 activation and Rab phosphorylation . Excessive Rab phosphorylation can perturb interactions between Rabs and downstream effectors , which impairs various aspects of membrane trafficking including lysosomal function . There is a clear need to better define how LRRK2 is recruited to lysosomes upon damage , how these steps translate to LRRK2 activation , and how broadly conserved these mechanisms are in PD .

[RESULTS] These results suggest that a small percentage of Rab12 and LRRK2 are present on lysosomes at baseline and that lysosomal damage leads to a significant increase in the localization of both proteins to the lysosome ( Figure 3-figure supplement 2 ) , but precise quantification of the amount of Rab12 and LRRK2 on lysosomes under these conditions is difficult and warrants further study . Rab10 phosphorylation was increased on lysosomes in response to LLOMe treatment while the levels of LRRK2 were not significantly impacted on lysosomes isolated from LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N KI cells , suggesting additional mechanisms beyond LRRK2 localization may also contribute to LRRK2 activation in response to lysosomal damage in these cells . Lysosomes isolated from WT
[DISCUSSION] LRRK2 activation in the face of minor or acute lysosomal insults likely plays a beneficial role in maintaining lysosomal function , while chronic LRRK2 activation triggered by genetic variants with increased kinase activity or low-level lysosomal damage over time may ultimately impair the ability to effectively respond to membrane stress and maintain the balance between lysosomal repair and destruction . We can not rule out the possibility that additional mechanisms beyond increased proximity between LRRK2 and its Rab substrates may contribute to Rab10 phosphorylation following lysosomal damage , as the magnitude of change in Rab10 phosphorylation induced by LLOMe treatment was greater than the extent of LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes . Additional studies suggested that LRRK2 hyperactivation triggers mechanisms aimed at clearing cargo from damaged lysosomes that have lost their proteolytic capacity , either through direct exocytosis of lysosomes or through a novel sorting process termed LYTL ( lysosomal tubulation/sorting driven by LRRK2 ) in which tubules
[METHODS] For immunoblot detection of endogenous LRRK2 , 25 % of the total immunoprecipitated material ( per condition ) was loaded onto a 3-8 % Tris-Acetate gel ( Thermo Fisher ) , fully resolved gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , probed overnight at 4°C with a 1/500 dilution of mouse anti-LRRK2 ( clone N241A/34 ; UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility ,",,957,96,None,"Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is caused by mutations in the gene for Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) , which is found in many cells . The mutations cause the protein to become more active , and this can lead to disease . However , it is not clear how the mutations affect the activity of the protein , or how they affect its activity . In PD patients , the protein is phosphorylated at the end of the lysosome , where it can be used to repair the damaged cytosol . It is thought that the protein can also be used as a messenger molecule , but it has not been known how this happens . Now , Wang et al . have identified a protein called Rab12 that is involved in regulating the activity and activity of this protein . This protein is known to be involved in many diseases , including Crohn's disease , Parkinson's and Crohn’s Disease . Previous studies have shown that Rab12 is recruited to the damaged endosomes of the cell , leading to increased levels of Rab10 , a molecule that is essential for the cell to function properly . Wang flies a fluorescent microscope into the damaged ends of a cell to identify Rab12 . These images show that the antibody Rab12 activates the protein when it is damaged . When the antibody is removed , Rab12 becomes active and the protein becomes more active in response to the damage . Further experiments revealed that the Rab12 protein is also recruited to damaged  Lysosomas , making it more likely that the proteins are involved in the repair of the damaged membranes . Furthermore , these findings suggest that the role of Rab12 in the recruitment of LLRK2 to the cyto"

[ABSTRACT] In this study , we addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment , the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 sensor , an automated image analysis pipeline , and a custom machine learning algorithm . This method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1 , which have unique cell cycle characteristics , and we tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells . Our cell cycle analysis system , which is also compatible with adherent cells , is fully automated and freely available , providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions . This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive , automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells . While current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells , non-adherent cells remain challenging . Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research . This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells .
[INTRODUCTION] Methods utilizing cells expressing fluorescently labeled reporters and time-lapse microscopy can discriminate cell cycle phases at the level of individual cells , thereby offering valuable insights into the variability of cell cycle and cell cycle phase durations within the overall cell population . Traditional methods for assessing cell cycle dynamics have been largely dependent on the quantification of DNA content through flow or image cytometry , providing a static snapshot of cell populations in various cycle phases . This dynamic insight is particularly crucial in the context of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , where chromosomal translocations generate fusion genes that disrupt cellular differentiation programs and drive proliferation . Dysregulation in these processes is a hallmark of malignancies such as human cancer , where aberrant activities in cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) , cyclins , and CDK inhibitors often drive uncontrolled proliferation . FUCCI ( CA ) 2 express the hCdt1 ( 1/100 ) fused to mCherry fluorescent protein and hGem ( 1/110 ) fused to mVenus , generating a clear and distinct tricolor demarcation , separating G1 ( red ) , S ( green ) , and G2/M phases ( yellow ) . To overcome the limitations of manual data analysis , we introduce an automated image analysis pipeline for time-lapse videos of AML cell lines , exploiting a FUCCI-based probe for visualization . Advanced imaging methods , such as time-lapse microscopy coupled with fluorescently tagged reporters , have shown promise in detailing cell cycle dynamics at the single-cell level . The described experimental setup utilizes nanostructured titanium oxide-coated multiwell plates relying on the technology used in the commercially available Smart BioSurface ( SBS ) slides . Technologies like the Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator ( FUCCI ) have been employed for this , effectively demarcating cell cycle phases through color-coding . Our data analysis approach combines custom image processing , TrackMate-based cell tracking , and machine learning-based track filtering , thereby automating the entire data analysis workflow . The approach leverages routine imaging technologies and advanced data analyses , enhancing the precision and efficiency of drug screening protocols in oncological research . Although valuable , these techniques fall short in capturing intra-population variability and require additional protein markers for precise phase determination . Consequently , targeting cell cycle components has emerged as a pivotal therapeutic strategy , especially crucial in preclinical drug evaluation
[RESULTS] Here are reported the obtained number of cells for each condition , merging all the experiments performed : By using the hue channel , each track was partitioned into its cell cycle component using the following thresholds : Additionally , a refinement step involving cell reassignment was conducted to identify instances where the G1 to S phase transition was labeled as G2/M in frames preceding the S phase . Figure 4C shows segmented nuclei of cells at the initial S phase ( arrows ) , characterized by dim EdU staining and DNA amount only slightly higher than 2N ( not shown ) , where the dim green and red fluorescence overlaid determined a predominant red ( when the intensity of mCherry is slightly
[DISCUSSION] The described work allows researchers in the field to analyze thousands of ( non- ) adherent cells per each experimental condition by using the image and data analysis pipelines to automatically perform image processing , cell tracking , filtering of incorrect tracks , and cell cycle phases identification and characterization . These range from creating custom supports to confine cell movement within a restricted region enabling extended imaging periods of up to 40 hr , to partially immobilizing cells using substances like gelatin or low-melting-point agarose . The capability to track non-adherent cells for up to 72 hr ( almost equivalent to three complete cell cycles in NB4 cells ) was achieved by employing SBS-coated glass in combination with the addition of MC to the culture medium . The seeding protocol could also certainly be extended to other types of live-cell imaging experiments , especially when the fluorescence intensity can be monitored for shorter durations , thereby circumventing the need
[METHODS] Briefly , the pipeline executed a flat-field correction on the fluorescence channels with the plugin Basic , then applied a Gaussian blur ( sigma = 1 px ) , a Top Hat filter ( radius = 20 px ) , and a background subtraction to enhance the cells ' signal ; duplicated images of red and green channels were merged in",,954,96,None,"Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people worldwide . It is caused by a mutation in a gene called a chromosome , which causes cells to divide and divide . This mutation can lead to cancer , but it is not known how the chromosomes are arranged . The cells that divide are called the cell cycle , and they are made up of a series of genes called fusion genes . These genes are then translated into proteins called cyclins . When a cell divides , it produces a protein called hCdt1 . However , this protein is not present in all cells . Instead , the fusion gene is found in the nucleus of the cell , where it is incorporated into a new protein called FUCCI ( CA ) 2 . CA 2 is used to measure the number of cells in the cell that divide , as well as how long it takes for the cell to grow . In addition , CA 2 can be used to track how many cells are in the same cell . To do this , a computer program called TrackMate uses a camera to record the movements of the cells in different conditions . Once the images have been processed , TrackMat can be added to the data to make it easier to analyze the data . Now , Wang et al . have developed a system that can be applied to hundreds of cells , including those that are not adherent to the microscope . They used the system to study the activity of the hCherry fluorescent protein , while the mVenus fluorescent protein was used to monitor the activity in the cells that are non-adherent . Using the system , they were able to measure how long the cells had been in different phases"

[ABSTRACT] Using brain imaging data from 16 primate species , we measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions , the frontal pole ( FP ) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , respectively , involved in metacognition and working memory , and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables . The size of these prefrontal regions , as well as the whole brain , was best explained by three variables : body mass , daily traveled distance ( an index of ecological constraints ) , and population density ( an index of social constraints ) . Thus , our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates . The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates . Interestingly , FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume , in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions . Recent comparative studies provided conflicting results regarding the contribution of social vs ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition . Here , we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology . The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains both a fascinating and a controversial issue .
[INTRODUCTION] Given the complexity encountered in natural environments , it is hazardous to extrapolate these findings in artificial laboratory conditions to the decision-making processes ( in both social and ecological dimensions ) occurring in wild primates , for which the diversity of social interactions ( e. g. number of individuals an animal can remember , degree of social awareness , i. e. knowledge and representation of the dominance hierarchy , kinship relations , or friendship associations ) and foraging behaviors ( e. g. food processing techniques , knowledge of harvesting schedules , extractive foraging ) require much more cognitive flexibility . To evaluate the relevance of laboratory-based neuro-cognitive concepts for understanding which cognitive operations could be mobilized to overcome specific socio-ecological challenges in the wild and their variability across species , we addressed the following central question : to what extent does the functional mapping between brain regions and specific executive functions in laboratory conditions relate to variability in socio-ecological variables at the interspecific level ? For this purpose , it is necessary to go beyond the handful of species usually studied in well-controlled laboratory conditions , not only to evaluate the reliability of the relations between neuro-anatomical measures and socio-ecological factors across primates , but also to quantify the contribution of phylogeny . In order to bridge this gap , we designed this study to derive and test predictions where a set of well-identified elementary cognitive operations and their associated brain regions ( as studied in laboratory conditions ) could be involved in more natural functions ( as assessed in wild animals living in their natural environments ) . We focused on two well-known cognitive operations , both considered as executive functions , and involving distinct regions of the prefrontal cortex : metacognition , which involves the frontal pole ( FP ) , and working memory , which involves the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , as demonstrated by extensive work in humans and macaques . But these relations between specific brain regions and socio-ecological variables across species provide little insight into the cognitive processes that could be at play , because they do not necessarily map onto specific neuro-cognitive processes identified in rigorous laboratory conditions . Based on the known positive relation between the size of a
[RESULTS] Given the difficulty to evaluate more precisely the border between DLPFC and FP , especially in species for which there is no brain atlas , we favored the conservative definitions of the FP and the DLPFC , and excluded this dorsal area which either includes a mixture of brain regions specifically associated with the DLPFC or the FP , or could be defined as an intermediate functional region between the two . In summary , the volume of the DLPFC across primates is also positively modulated by body mass as well as by both ecological ( daily traveled distance ) and social ( population density ) variables , but the influence of the later appears much weaker than
[DISCUSSION] Interestingly , the whole brain volume ( which is strongly correlated with both FP and DLPFC ) seems to show an intermediate tendency : even if the effect of population density appears smaller than that of daily traveled distance ( beta weight is one order of magnitude smaller ) , it is clearly significant , and the 'leave-one-out ' procedure indicated that it was only slightly less reliable than daily traveled distance , with a significant decrease in model fit quality for four vs one combination of species . In other words , the error with which these variables were estimated at the level of individual species was small enough to allow us to study the relation of interest across species , and from that perspective , there is no reason to exclude any species from that analysis and our sample appears reliable enough to characterize the relation between neuroanatomical features and socio-ecological
[METHODS] Eleven socio-ecological variables were selected for the analyses , gathered in different categories : body condition ( body mass ) , diet ( dietary quality index and tool use ) , movements and ranging behavior ( daily traveled distance ) , social parameters ( group size , population density , social system ) , and variables related to",,970,97,None,"Humans and other primates have a wide range of cognitive abilities , including thinking , remembering , and working memory . However , it is not clear how these abilities are adapted to the environment in which they live . For example , some primates are able to learn how to make food , while others are unable to remember how many people they have . The brains of these animals are made up of two regions called the frontal pole and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex . These regions are involved in a number of different tasks , such as foraging , foraging for food and learning how to harvest crops . In humans , these regions are known as executive functions , but in primates , they are not known how they work . Now , Wang et al . have used brain imaging data from 16 primate species to study how these regions work in the wild . This revealed that the size of these two regions , as well as the whole brain , was influenced by three factors: body mass , daily traveled distance and population density . Wang also found that the volume of these regions was much more sensitive to social constraints than the volume at the front of the brain . Therefore , the size and volume of the front and dorses of the prefrontals of primates differed significantly between species . Thus , this study highlights the importance of social and ecological constraints on the evolution of specific brain regions and their associated cognitive operations . It also highlights the relevance of laboratory-based neuro-cognitive concepts for understanding which cognitive operations could be mobilized to overcome specific socio-ecological challenges ."

[ABSTRACT] After extensively validating the automated measurements , we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis . Collectively , the outcomes of this study offer insight into a fundamentally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it . Electron microscopy ( EM ) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question , but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process . Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils , but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils ( i. e. myofibril hypertrophy ) and/or the number of myofibrils ( i. e. myofibrillogenesis ) is not known . Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast , and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number . An increase in mechanical loading , such as that which occurs during resistance exercise , induces radial growth of muscle fibers ( i. e. an increase in cross-sectional area ) . To overcome this , we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope ( fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution [ FIM-ID ] ) .
[INTRODUCTION] Furthermore , the extensive fixation and processing required for EM often yields samples that are not readily amenable to immunolabeling , and EM images typically do not have a high degree of contrast between the area that is occupied by the myofibrils and the intermyofibrillar components that surround the myofibrils ( e. g. the sarcoplasmic reticulum [ SR ] , see Figure 4A ) . Indeed , the model seemed so convincing that , when discussing how an increase in mechanical loading leads to the growth of muscle fibers , Goldspink concluded `` The number of myofibrils increases , and this is almost certainly due to the longitudinal splitting of existing myofibrils rather than de novo assembly '' . Indeed , both sedentary and active adults will lose 30-40 % of their muscle mass by the age of 80 , and this loss in muscle mass is associated with disability , loss of independence , an increased risk of morbidity and mortality , as well as an estimated $ 40 billion in annual hospitalization costs in the United States alone . With this method in hand , we then set out to answer the fundamentally important question of whether the radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis . In support of his model , Goldspink published numerous images of single myofibrils that appeared to split into two smaller daughter myofibrils , as well as quantitative data which demonstrated that longitudinal splits usually occur in myofibrils that are significantly larger than myofibrils that do not contain splits . For instance , during radial growth , the cross-sectional area ( CSA ) of the muscle fiber increases , but whether this is mediated by an increase in the CSA of the individual myofibrils ( i. e. myofibril hypertrophy ) and/or the number of myofibrils ( i. e. myofibrillogenesis ) has not been resolved . For instance , in Goldspink 's aforementioned conclusion , neither reference , nor any other study that we are aware of , has ever shown that an increase in mechanical loading leads to an increase in the number of myofibrils per fiber . Thus , the first goal of this study
[RESULTS] To further address whether the radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis , we examined vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from humans that were collected before ( Pre ) and after ( Post ) they had performed 7 weeks of progressive RE ( Figure 6A ) . For the FIM-ID workflow , an additional step was needed to classify randomly selected fibers as being Ox or Gly , and this was done by taking advantage of previous studies which have shown that mitochondria are enriched with NADH and FAD+ , which are endogenous fluorophores that can be excited with blue light . To examine
[DISCUSSION] With the use of FIM-ID , the pursuit of such studies would be a feasible endeavor and the resulting data would not only help to resolve whether myofibril hypertrophy contributes to the radial growth response , but it would also provide insight into whether myofibril hypertrophy precedes the onset of myofibrillogenesis as predicted by the myofibril splitting model . With the development of our method , we were able to gain insight into whether the radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis . Importantly , these pipelines were developed in a free open-source program ( CellProfiler ) , and our manuscript includes copies of the pipelines along with instructions and test images so that prospective users can easily employ them ( see Source code 1 ) . As illustrated throughout the study , the images from FIM-ID have

The single or",,973,97,None,"When a person exercises , their muscles become more flexible . This is because the muscle fibers that surround them are made up of myofibrils , or ‘myofibrillars’ . These fibrous structures are called myofilars and are made of proteins called myofilars . When the muscle becomes too stiff , it can cause the muscle to shrink , which can lead to muscle loss . However , this is not always the case . Muscle fibers can grow in a number of ways , including by increasing the size of the myofiliars and by increasing their number . For example , when the muscle is being pushed by a machine , the muscle fibres will grow more . But how does this happen ? To answer this question , Goldspink et al . used a technique called fluorescence microscopy ( FIM-ID ) to measure the size and number of the muscles that are growing . The experiments showed that the growth of muscle cells is mainly caused by an increase in mechanical loading . In contrast , if the muscle was being loaded , there would be a decrease in the number of muscle fiber cells . Therefore , these results suggest that muscle cells grow more quickly , and that this increases the amount of muscle that is needed to move . Further experiments also showed that if a mechanical load increases , muscle cells may grow more rapidly ."

[ABSTRACT] These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased the release probability , which are gain-of-function features not found in Syt1 knockout ( KO ) neurons ; normalized mEPSC release rates were higher ( potency D166Y > V48F ) than in the Syt1 KO . The V48F and D166Y mutants ( with potency D166Y > V48F ) led to reduced readily releasable pool ( RRP ) size , due to increased spontaneous ( miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Current , mEPSC ) release and decreased priming rates . In contrast , the I67N mutant decreased mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes due to an increase in the height of the energy barrier for fusion , whereas the RRP size was unaffected . All three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and when expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons . We studied three mutations in SNAP25 that cause epileptic encephalopathy : V48F , and D166Y in the synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 ) -binding interface , and I67N , which destabilizes the SNARE complex . These mutations ( potency D166Y > V48F ) increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs , resulting in unregulated membrane fusion . Overall , pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion . This could be partly compensated by positive charges lowering the energy barrier . SNAP25 is one of three neuronal SNAREs driving synaptic vesicle exocytosis .
[INTRODUCTION] Synaptic phenotypes of Munc18-1 hypo-expression have been identified in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction , in cultured mouse neurons and in brain slices of STXBP1 heterozygous mice , as well as in human neurons , whereas expression of human missense mutations in STXBP1 null mouse neurons led to synaptic phenotypes for some mutations , but not for others . Additional experiments both in vitro and in cells demonstrate that V48F and especially D166Y represent partial gain-of-function mutations that increase association to partner SNAREs and lower the energy barrier for fusion , bypassing Syt1-dependent control . reported a smaller RRP for the I67N mutant , but the I67 residue is present in the internal of layer +4 , which we expected to affect final SNARE complex zippering causing membrane fusion rather than priming . De novo mutations in SNAREs and associated proteins lead to complex neurological disease , characterized by drug-resistant epilepsy , intellectual disability , movement disorders , and often autism ; a syndrome which has been denoted 'SNAREopathy ' . SNARE complexes assemble in a zipper-like manner ; partially assembled SNAREpins bind synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 ) and complexin within two separate interaction sites : the primary interface formed between a synaptotagmin-1 molecule and syntaxin-1 and SNAP25 , and the tripartite interface formed by syntaxin-1 and VAMP2 with another Syt1 molecule and complexin . Conversely , C-terminal mutations in the so-called 'layer residues ' , whose side chains point to the center of the SNARE complex and are involved in SNAREpin zippering , led to a decrease in both evoked and spontaneous release . The I67N is a classical dominant-negative mutation , which increases the energy barrier for fusion , but does not change the size of the RRP if probed by a sufficiently high concentration of sucrose , nor does the I67N change the electrostatics of triggering itself . This complex is under tight control by upstream partner protein Munc18-1 , which acts as a template for SNARE complex formation , and Munc13s , which assist in the transitions required along the pathway of assembly . These include different forms of haploinsufficiency , where the mutated protein is either lost altogether or has lost its functionality , and dominant-negative or recessive variants , as well as variants
[RESULTS] Patch-clamp measurements demonstrated strongly reduced spontaneous release frequencies ( Figure 10H-J ) and evoked release amplitude ( Figure 10K , L ) with the I67N mutation , see also Alten et al. , 2021. mEPSCs were absent in most I67N expressing neurons , whereas WT and I67N co-expressing neurons had a very low mEPSC rate , much closer to the I67N than the WT phenotype ; similar for eEPSC amplitudes and charges ( Figure 10L-M ) . SNAP25 WT did not show any binding to Syt1 SUVs ( Figure 9-figure supplement 1 ) , although direct interactions with Syt1 would be predicted based on the primary interface , indicating that such interactions are not stable under the
[DISCUSSION] This can be explained by the different function of SNAP25 domains during fusion , where V48 and D166 help set up an arrested primed vesicle state by interacting with Syt1 , whereas I67 participates in the final conformational change , the 'stroke ' that leads to assembly of the C-terminal end of the complex and the linker domain . When combining the I67N with the 4K mutation , which introduces six extra positive fixed charges , we could place our data within the framework of our model for electrostatic triggering and show that the effect of charge per se is approximately the same in the I67N mutant as in the WT . Similarly , we recently showed by cryo-electron tomography that the 4K mutation , which increased the mEPSC frequency to ~30 Hz and had a reduced RRP caused a loss of synaptic vesicles tethered to the membrane with three tethers ,
[METHODS] Solving for the activation energy , we get : ( 7 ) Ea=RT ( ln⁡ ( A ) −ln ( k ) ) Since A is unknown , we can not use this equation to calculate the absolute values of the transition energies ; however , when we compare a mutation to the WT condition , and under",,974,97,None,"Neurons in the brain are made up of a group of proteins called synaptic vesicles . These VEs bind to a protein called Synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 ) , which is responsible for forming a complex of SNAREs . The SNAP25 protein is a key component of the SNare complex , and it is thought that the mutations in this protein cause epileptic encephalopathy . However , it is not clear how these mutations cause epilepsy . To investigate , Wang et al . used a technique called X-ray crystallography to study the effects of three different mutations on the phenotype of epilepsic encephalitis . In the experiments , the mutants were exposed to two different types of sugars , one of which was a sugar called Ca2+ . This sugar was found to be more active than the sugar in the yeast yeast , but it was not clear whether this was due to the presence of the sugar or to the fact that the yeast had a higher energy barrier than the normal yeast . Wang also found that the mutant cells released more sugars than normal cells , indicating that the enzymes involved in the fusion process are less active . Interestingly , when the mutant neurons were exposed , they released more glucose than normal neurons . Thus , these changes in the energy barrier caused epileptical encephantasia , suggesting that the effect of the mutation could be partly compensated by positive charges lowering the threshold for fusion ."

[ABSTRACT] This affects men and women , and is robust to age , number of research outputs , and bibliometric measures where such data are available . We use data from 30 countries and find that the more women in a discipline , the lower quality the research in that discipline is evaluated to be and the lower the funding success rate is . Our work builds on others ' findings that women 's work is valued less , regardless of who performs that work .
[INTRODUCTION] Higher 'expectations of brilliance ' in a discipline is related to a lower proportion of women entering Leslie et al. , 2015 ; and research area is a strong contributor to the lower funding success rates of African American/Black scientists . Other studies have explored possible explanations for this seemingly gendered pattern in evaluation of research quality , such as societal , institutional , and academic factors , including gender bias . However , our research shows a different correlation : a higher proportion of women in a discipline is correlated with lower research quality evaluations and funding success rates , for everyone in the field . And apart from a few exceptions , most analyses show that women 's funding success rates are lower than men 's both in terms of number of grants and size of grants . We use independent datasets spanning thousands of researchers and 30 countries and look separately at research funding success rates and holistic research quality scores . Academic disciplines can be quite different to one another in ways such as publication rates , citation rates , and expected h-indices . We consistently find that researchers in male-dominated disciplines have both higher funding success rates , and higher research quality scores , than researchers in female-dominated disciplines . Evaluations of research quality affect many aspects of an academic career , from hiring and promotion decisions to funding success . Women are also less likely to get credit for their innovations and awards , particularly prestigious ones , are less likely to be given to women . There are fewer women in STEM subjects , and more women than men use qualitative methods , rather than quantitative , in research . On an individual level , women publish less than men , receive fewer citations , and have lower h-indices . Recent research suggests women react differently than men to a change in a journal 's prestige or impact factor . Where possible we account for researcher characteristics like age , research institution , and publishing patterns . Many have observed that women 's research is evaluated as lower quality than men 's research . We find a strong correlation between the evaluated quality of a researcher 's work and the gender balance of the researcher 's discipline . There are different norms for the expected number of co-authors , order of authors , and attributions . Applications from researchers , both male and female , in female-dominated disciplines have lower success rates . Recent research suggests there are interactions between
[RESULTS] As our three datasets vary considerably rather than choose a model a priori we start with a maximal model that includes the key variables Gender , pmen , and , when available , Time with up to two-way interactions between all variables . For EIGE the gender balance of each discipline was available separately for over 80 % of the dataset and covered all researchers in the discipline nationally , in the remaining cases it was approximated with the applicant gender balance . Data is also available for 2015 but as no discipline changed by more than 2 percentage points between 2015 and 2018 it was not used here . For ARC gender balance was available separately ( see Supplementary Materials for details ) and again covered the whole population though it was
[DISCUSSION] However , we do see that across all disciplines women have lower scores than men and this is more pronounced in female-dominated disciplines which is suggestive of gender bias but far from conclusive due to the many factors at play . But when we include discipline gender bias ( Figure 2C ) the picture is less clear suggesting that if we compare a man and a woman with the same number of outputs the person in the minority gender is likely to have a higher score . For research funding datasets ( ARC , CIHR , EIGE ) , quotas or pre-allocation of funds towards certain types of research ( e. g. public health funding increasing during the Covid pandemic ) could explain some of our findings . Although empirics are limited it has been seen that unconscious biases can affect common academic metrics and practices such as h-index , citation , authorship , and peer review , as well as hiring and progression . If local policy prioritises funding to Engineering
[METHODS] When we consider a male-dominated ( pmen=75 % ) discipline , like Physics or Philosophy , given gender-equal ( but now likely to be high ) publication rates , overall scores are much higher , a man 's score is predicted to be 467/700 and a woman 's is higher still at 505/700 ( Figure 2C , right bars ) . By way of example ,",,914,94,None,"Many scientists work in the field of biomedical research , but it is not clear how this is achieved . One way to find out is to look at the quality of the research that is being done . This is often done by looking at the number of people involved in the research . For example , some researchers are more likely to be paid less for their work than others . However , other researchers are less likely to have a higher quality of their work , and they are less able to get credit for their innovations . In particular , women are less well-known in STEM fields , where they use qualitative methods , rather than quantitative methods . It has been suggested that gender bias may also play a role in the evaluation of research quality . But it is unclear whether this is the case . To address this question , Weidman et al . looked at data from 30 countries . The results show that researchers in male-dominated disciplines have higher funding success rates , while researchers in female-dominated fields have lower funding success rate . These findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that women’s work is valued less , regardless of who performs that work . They also show that women in STEM disciplines are less motivated to publish and receive more citations , which is more likely than men to be given to women ."

[ABSTRACT] By engineering the crRNA : tracrRNA interaction , we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions , as well as the chemically induced dimerization of protein domains , can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells . Additionally , we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors , potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit . Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits , whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA . Here , we demonstrate a strategy termed 'P3 editing ' , which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA . Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing , facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells . One of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs . Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits , processing information in a predictable manner within living cells . However , programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging .
[INTRODUCTION] The function of a protein might be to simply recognize another peptide with high affinity and specificity as in the case of epitope-antibody interaction , or their interactions can be dynamically controlled by post-transcriptional modifications or the presence of small molecules that act as 'molecular glues ' . P3 editing is based on the dual-component gRNA of the native CRISPR-Cas9 system , but with the crRNA : tracrRNA dimerization domain replaced with two protein-binding RNA aptamers such as MS2 and BoxB hairpins . Finally , we explore whether P3 editing can be coupled to ADAR-based RNA sensors to control genome editing based on RNA expression , potentially expanding the range of inputs that can be used to drive signal-specific editing in synthetic molecular circuits . For example , various synthetic circuits have been built to modulate gene expression or post-translational modifications , in response to a wide range of input signals such as the presence of specific small molecules . Using such protein-sensing elements , one can imagine constructing synthetic circuits that sense protein-based signals to conditionally trigger genome editing of a specific genomic location , possibly in the form of a signal-specific editing outcome . However , it remains unclear how to develop sensors that trigger specific genome editing outcomes for a broader range of event classes ( e. g. protein-protein interactions , exposure to small molecules , gene expression , etc . Since its initial use for genome editing via a programmable nuclease , various genome and epigenome editing methods have been developed that leverage the CRISPR-Cas9 protein as an integral component . Changes in the genome ( or epigenome ) can alter the expression of specific genes , unlock the synthesis of specific proteins , or simply serve as a record of past events stably etched into genomic DNA . The edit could be used to change the function of a specific gene via insertion/deletion/substitution , to modulate its expression via CRISPRa/i , or to record a memory of the signal into the genome via a 'DNA Typewriter Tape ' . The main advantage of engineering the CRISPR-gRNA instead of protein components is the possibility of multiplexing , i. e. , linking each molecular sensor to a different genome editing target site and/or editing outcome . Interactions or proximity between two different proteins tagged
[RESULTS] When we transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids expressing MCP-LambdaN , PE4max , crRNA-MS2 , and BoxB-petracrRNA that target HEK3 locus and program for CTT insertion at +0 position , we observed 15 % editing efficiency , which was 52 % of the editing rate achieved by transfecting a single , standard epegRNA-expressing plasmid that programs the same edit along with the PE4max-expressing plasmid ( 'eCTT control ' ) ( Figure 2b ) . We transfected HEK293T cells with a mix of plasmids expressing : crRNA-MS2 , BoxB-tracrRNA , one of the three base editors , and either the LambdaN-MCP fusion protein that brings crRNA-MS2 and BoxB-tracrRNA into close proximity or GFP to serve as a negative control and measure the
[DISCUSSION] We have explored how modifying the crRNA and petracrRNA pair sequences can tune the efficiency-vs-specificity tradeoff , but alternative avenues to improvement ( e. g. better docking of RNA aptamers such as MS2 , BoxB , or PP7 by testing more linker sequences that place crRNA and petracrRNA for duplex formation ) may be more fruitful in terms of achieving high efficiency and specificity at once ( e. g. > 50 % editing in the setting of a specific protein-protein interaction , and < 1 % editing without it ) . Although various sensors of RNA or protein production have been developed , the readout is almost always in the form of luminescence or fluorescence , because microscopy- or flow-sorting-based detection methods are common modes of detection with high sensitivity , possibly overcoming low conversion efficiency by sensors as long as they have high specificity . In our view , there are four outstanding challenges for
[METHODS] All protein expression constructs ( Supplementary file 1 ) were cloned using Gibson Assembly ( NEB , where double-stranded DNA fragments are either ordered from IDT as gBlocks or PCR-amplified from existing constructs with at least 25 bp overlap in sequence ) . A small amount ( 1-2 µL ) of Gibson Assembly reaction mix was added to NEB",,960,96,None,"Genome editing is a process that can be used to change the expression of a specific gene or to record information about the activity of another gene . This can be done by modifying the DNA of the cell , or by removing a protein from the genome . The process is called genome editing , and it is based on the CRISPR-Cas9 protein . However , it is not clear how this process can be controlled . To understand how genome editing works , researchers have developed a technique called ‘P3 editing’ . P3 editing is made up of two proteins , one of which binds to a molecule called RNA , which is then inserted into the DNA . When the RNA is inserted , the protein is tagged with a dimer , allowing it to interact with other proteins in the DNA to make a signal . In this way , when the protein interacts with another protein , its dimerization becomes chemically induced . It can then be used as a trigger to modify a gene , such as by deleting a particular protein or deleting another protein that is already present . Now , Wang et al . have developed an algorithm that allows the P3-editing to be used in artificial cells . By using a combination of RNA sensors and RNA molecules , they show that P3 edits can be triggered by a variety of inputs . For example , some proteins can be linked to RNA signals , while others can be directly connected to the DNA itself . Wang enlisted the help of scientists at the University of California , Berkeley , to develop a new approach that could be applied to the design of synthetic molecular circuits that can control genome editing in humans ."

[ABSTRACT] Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) are potent activators of KCNQ1 channels and activate IKs channels by binding to two different sites , one in the voltage sensor domain - which shifts the voltage dependence to more negative voltages - and the other in the pore domain - which increases the maximal conductance of the channels ( Gmax ) . In addition , it is unclear why IKs channels have a very small single-channel conductance and a low open probability or whether PUFAs affect any of these properties of IKs channels . Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable , contributing to the low open probability , and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state . Mutations in IKs cause long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) , a syndrome with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG , which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death . One potential therapeutical intervention for LQTS is based on targeting IKs channels to restore channel function and/or the physiological QT interval . In cardiomyocytes , the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current ( IKs ) , pivotal during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential . However , the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the Gmax of the IKs channels is still poorly understood .
[INTRODUCTION] At present , treatment of LQTS is mainly based on the usage of β-blockers ( most used are long-lasting preparations such as nadolol and atenolol ) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators , especially for patients with high risk of sudden death and frequent syncope . In this study , we use a combination of two-electrode voltage-clamp , single-channel recordings , site-directed mutagenesis , and recent cryoEM structures to gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the Gmax effect following PUFA binding at Site II . We propose a novel mechanism where the selectivity filter of KCNQ1 is normally unstable and the binding of PUFA to Site II stabilizes a network of interactions at the selectivity filter , which , in turn , leads to a more open and stable conformation of the KCNQ1 pore and thus an increase in channel open probability . Although previous studies have shown the importance of K326 for PUFA in increasing Gmax through binding at Site II , the mechanism by which PUFAs increase Gmax is still not understood . Here the channel associates with the accessory KCNE1 subunit , generating the so-called slow delayed-rectifier ( IKs ) current , an important contributor to the repolarizing phase of the ventricular action potential ( AP ) . These LQTS mutations cause a reduction of the channel current , leading to a significant prolongation of the ventricular AP waveform that can be seen on the electrocardiogram as a prolonged QT interval . Site II is found in the pore domain , where electrostatic interactions between the PUFA head group and the positively charged residue , K326 , facilitate an increase in the maximal conductance of the channel . Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) , in particular omega 3 , are known to exert a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in the diet at least twice a week . Site I is found in the VSD , where the PUFA head group interacts with the positive charges in the S4 segment and causes the channel to open at more negative potentials . Each α-subunit is composed of six transmembrane segments , with S1-S4 forming the voltage sensor domain ( VSD ) and S5-S6 forming the pore domain ( PD ) ( Figure 1D )
[RESULTS] If PUFA binding to K326 and D301 promotes a series of interactions that stabilize the pore , then residues at the upper part of the selectivity filter , such as Y315 and D317 , might be involved in those interactions that promote an open-conductive conformation of the channel . For instance , we speculate that in the conductive state , hydrogen bonds between W304-D317 and W305-Y315 , which are likely absent in the non-conductive conformation of KCNQ1 , are created and that PUFA binding to K326 and D301 at Site II favors the transition toward the conductive state of the channel ( Figure 7 ) . In our previous MD simulations based on the cryoEM structure of KCNQ1
[DISCUSSION] Note also the currents from KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels display little external K+ dependence ( a small inhibition in addition to what is expected from changes in driving force ) and that KCNQ1 channels are more strongly inhibited by high extracellular K+ concentrations in contrast to other Kv channels , such as Shaker K+ channels , which are inactivated more in low K+ . This difference in the stability of the aromatic cuff between Shaker and KCNQ1 might explain why the effect of PUFA on Gmax is large for KCNQ1 but not seen in Shaker even if the residues involved in the Gmax effect are conserved between these two channels . We hypothesize that those hydrogen bonds between W304-D317 and W305-Y315 and the proline interactions are likely absent in the non-conductive conformation of KCNQ1 , thereby generating the high number of empty sweeps in control conditions . We have here shown that the interaction at

To measure the conductance vs voltage ( G-V )",,972,97,None,"When a person has a heart attack , the heart pumps blood into the body to help the heart beat faster . This process is called the repolarization of the heart , and it is known as long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) . LQT syndrome is caused by mutations in the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex , which is found in the heart muscle . The channel complex is made up of two different sites: one in the voltage sensor domain , where the voltage depends on more negative currents , while the other in the pore domain . These two sites are known as selectivity filters . However , it is not clear how these two sites work together , or why they are different . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called cryo-EM to study the structure of the channel complex in the brain . In the experiments , a group of proteins called polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) were inserted into the channels . Using this technique , they found that the channels have a very small open probability , but they are still able to open at higher voltages than normal . They also discovered that the channel is normally unstable , leading to a low open probability for the channels to open . Furthermore , their interactions with the potassium channel blocker KCNE 1 , an important component of the cellular signaling pathway , stabilized the channel pore . Finally , these studies revealed that the protein binding to the potassium channels increases the open probability of the channels opening . If this is the case , then the channel can open more quickly . Wang"

[ABSTRACT] Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate phosphatase ( PDXP ) , an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate ( PLP ) , the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6 , may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies . Still , the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood , and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well . We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors . Using a combination of small-molecule screening , protein crystallography , and biolayer interferometry , we discover , visualize , and analyze 7 , 8-dihydroxyflavone ( 7 , 8-DHF ) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor . Our discovery of 7 , 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7 , 8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain . Of note , 7 , 8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models , although its mechanism of action is actively debated . Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades . 7 , 8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency . However , pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking . In mouse hippocampal neurons , 7 , 8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner . These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target .
[INTRODUCTION] Although the mechanisms of PLP delivery within the cells are still largely unknown , it is clear that the intracellular availability of PLP for co-enzymatic functions depends on PLP carriers/scavengers and on the hydrolytic activity of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate phosphatase ( PDXP ) . We have previously shown that the genetic knockout of PDXP ( PDXP-KO ) in mice increases brain PLP levels and improves spatial memory and learning , suggesting that elevated PLP levels can improve cognitive functions in this model . Cellular PLP availability in the brain depends on numerous factors , including the intestinal absorption of B6 vitamers , extracellular phosphatases , inter-organ transport and intracellular enzymes , and carriers/scavengers involved in PLP formation and homeostasis . 7 , 8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models characterized by impaired cognition , and widely regarded as a tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) agonist with brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) -mimetic activity . Population studies indicate that low vitamin B6 levels are common among older people , and suggest that vitamin B6 deficiency may influence memory performance and may contribute to age-related cognitive decline . We therefore reasoned that a pharmacological inhibition of PDXP may be leveraged to increase intracellular PLP levels and conducted a high-throughput screening campaign to identify small-molecule PDXP modulators . In humans , PLP is known to be required for 44 distinct biochemical reactions , including the biosynthesis and/or metabolism of neurotransmitters , amino acids , lipids , and glucose . More potent , efficacious , and selective PDXP inhibitors may be useful future tools to explore a possible benefit of elevated PLP levels in brain disorders . Nevertheless , the exact molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies are often insufficiently understood , and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear . Vitamin B6 is an essential micronutrient that plays an important role in the nervous system , with the vitamin B6 status affecting cognitive function at any age . Vitamin B6 deficiency is also associated with other conditions characterized by impaired learning and memory , including neuropsychiatric disorders , Alzheimer 's disease , and inflammation . The term vitamin B6 encompasses the enzymatically interconvertible compounds pyridoxine , pyridoxamine , pyridoxal ( collectively
[RESULTS] Thus , although we did not find evidence for major cap/core or substrate specificity loop movements in PDXP , the presence or absence of a salt bridge formed between the cap domain residue Glu152 ( Glu148 ) and the core domain residue Arg62 indicates subtle conformational changes in PDXP that may mediate an opening or a closure of the active site entrance . One side of this cavity is formed by the more polar residues Asp27 , Asn60 , Ser61 , and Arg62 ( identical amino acid residue numbering in mPDXP and hPDXP ) , whereas the opposite side is established by the more hydrophobic residues Tyr150 , His182 , Pro183 , and Leu184 ( corresponding to
[DISCUSSION] Our observation that the expression of PDXP is substantially upregulated in hippocampi of middle-aged mice suggests that a therapeutic vitamin B6 supplementation alone may not suffice to elevate intracellular PLP levels under conditions where the PLP-degrading phosphatase is hyperactive . The identification of 7 , 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor reported here indicates that this flavone may modulate vitamin B6-dependent processes and suggests that PDXP could be explored as a pharmacological entry point into brain disorders . We also present three high-resolution 7 , 8-DHF/PDXP co-crystal structures that will facilitate the design of more potent , efficacious , and selective PDXP inhibitors in the future . Although PLP deficiency is thought to contribute to the respective human conditions , PLP-dependent processes have not yet been considered in the context of 7 , 8-DHF-induced effects .

However , it is not clear how vitamin B6 affects the brain , and how it affects people with brain disorders .

The molecule binds to and inhibits the enzyme , but the mechanism of action is still poorly understood . To investigate this question , Weiss et al . used a technique called biolayer interferometry to study the structure of a small molecule called 7 , 8-dihydroxyflavone . This molecule was found in the brains of mice , where it is known to be a potent inhibitor of the enzyme that controls the levels of pyritidine , a molecule that is also known to play a role in the production of lipids and other molecules .

[ABSTRACT] We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4 , which possess mirror-symmetric orientation , is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins ( CWN-1 , CWN-2 , and EGL-20 ) with distinct functions . The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells ( DTCs ) , which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors ( SGPs ; Z1 and Z4 ) . In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1 , DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side . These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ . Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration . In lin-17 mutants , CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4 , while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4 , respectively . Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 ( RNAi ) animals producing ectopic DTCs . Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration . In contrast , EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4 . However , the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood .
[INTRODUCTION] In the gonad , at the L1 stage , somatic gonadal precursor ( SGP ) cells , Z1 and Z4 have LH and HL polarity , respectively , creating their mirror-symmetric lineages producing distal tip cells ( DTCs ) from the distal daughters ( Z1 . In the dorsal and ventral sides of the compound eye of Drosophila , ommatidia have mirror-image chirality that is regulated by protocadherins Fat/Dachsous and PCP ( planar cell polarity ) signaling . However , the posterior migration of ectopically positioned DTCs from Z1 passing through germ cells in the triple mutants , along with DTC migration in germless mes-1 mutants , strongly suggests self-migratory mechanisms of DTCs . Our results suggest that the distal positions of DTCs in the gonad through the mirror-symmetric polarity of SGPs are required for stable distal migration , consistent with the recent report supporting the permissive migration model . While the quintuple Wnt mutants exhibit normal SGP polarity , we observed a significant impact on polarity when Wnt mutations are present in the background of the lin-17/Frizzled mutation . Additionally , during gonadogenesis , each DTC migrates with a U-shaped trajectory to guide extension of gonad arms , resulting in U-shaped gonad both on the anterior and posterior sides ( Figure 1A ) . We have shown previously that SGP polarity is not affected in quintuple Wnt mutants that have mutations in all five Wnt genes in C. elegans , suggesting that Wnts may not be required for SGP polarity . At the midline of the neural rod in the developing zebrafish neural tube , the polarity regulator Pard3 is localized on the cleavage furrow of neural progenitors and inherited by the two daughter cells on either side of the midline . Nuclear localization of POP-1/TCF , for example , is higher in the anterior than the posterior daughter cells ( hereafter called HL polarity for high-low POP-1 concentration ) . LIN-17 functions in a Wnt-independent manner , as LIN-17 lacking the Wnt binding domain ( cysteine-rich domain [ CRD ] ) can rescue gonadal defects in compound mutants containing the lin-17 mutation . During the development of C. elegans , most cells are polarized in the same anterior-posterior orientation and divide asymmetrically to produce distinct daughter cells . For
[RESULTS] Although mutations in other Wnt genes ( cwn-1 and egl-20 ) by themselves or in combination did not cause such enhancements , the cwn-1 mutation enhanced the phenotype of lin-17 ; cwn-2 for both the anterior and posterior DTCs , resulting in the majority of lin-17 ; cwn-1 ; cwn-2 triple mutants lacking both gonadal arms and being sterile . In addition , among mes-1 animals that lack germ cells , we found 84 % of DTCs ( n=90 ) were observed outside of the central region near the developing vulva at the L3-L4 stages , suggesting their distal migration to some extent ( Figure 6C-E ) . At the late L2 stage of lin-17 ; egl-20 cwn-2
[DISCUSSION] We have shown that Z1-derived DTC can migrate posteriorly in cki-1 ( RNAi ) as well as lin-17 ; egl-20 cwn-2 animals , indicating that ectopically positioned DTCs can mis-migrate passing through germ cells irrespective of mutations in Wnt signaling genes . We have previously shown that the polarity of seam cells ( V1-V5 ) is redundantly regulated by cwn-1 , cwn-2 , and egl-20 , indicating that all three of these Wnts induce the same polarity orientation ( HL for high-low POP-1 concentration ) . In seam cells , Wnt receptors including LIN-17/Fzd and MOM-5/Fzd appear to have Wnt-independent functions for cell polarization , as seam cells are still mostly polarized in the quintuple Wnt mutants , while they are strongly unpolarized in the triple receptor mutants ( lin-17 mom-5 cam-1/Ror ) . In Drosophila , Fz/Fzd has been primarily considered to function Wnt-independently to coordinate PCP between neighboring cells , though Fz
[METHODS] The following mutations and transgenes were used : cwn-1 ( ok546 ) ( deletion ) , cwn-2 ( ok895 ) ( deletion ) , egl-20 ( n585 ) ( missense behaving like null ) , lin-17 ( nonsense ) and lin-17 ( n671 ) ( nonsense ) , mig-1 ( nonsense ) , mom-5 ( ne12 ) (",,966,97,None,"The brain is made up of a set of cells called somatic gonadal precursors . These precursors are arranged in a mirror-like shape , with the gonad forming a triangle-like structure . The neocortex is a type of organ that contains a number of different types of cells , including a small intestine , a brain , and an eye . In the developing nematode , the ommatidia , which are a group of cells that are known as the ganglia , are shaped like a circle . When the nascent gonglia develops , it is thought that these gonids will move to the posterior side of the axis of the brain . However , this is not the case in the worm , where a protein called LIN-17 is involved in regulating the polarity of the somatic Gonadal Preparation Cells ( Z1 and Z4 ) . This protein , called CWN-1 , controls the position of the DTCs in the body , but it is not clear how this is controlled . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a model organism called C . elegans to study how the asymmetric divisions of Z1 , Z4 and Z1 affect the angular symmetry of the eyes . They found that a mutation in the Wnt protein CWN-2 caused the ectopic migration of the two gonchids to occur in the posterior and anterior sides of the eye , respectively . Furthermore , when the mutants were unable to migrate to the anterior side , they often mis-migrated . Wang "

[ABSTRACT] On the other hand , by demonstrating that hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to a few groups with characteristic tradeoffs , our findings may yet empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance . This question is difficult because the drug-resistant mutants observed in the clinic , and even those evolved in controlled laboratory settings , are often biased towards those that provide large fitness benefits . Here , we perform evolution experiments utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness advantage in fluconazole , a common antifungal drug . More generally speaking , by grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms , our work guides efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation . We then quantify fitness tradeoffs for each of 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments , finding these mutants group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs . Major questions remain about the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable , specifically , whether the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs . These findings , on one hand , demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments . Thus , the mutations ( and mechanisms ) that provide drug resistance may be more diverse than current data suggests . Tradeoffs are common in evolution and occur when , for example , resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another . Their unique tradeoffs may imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms . For example , we find some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination , while others do . There is growing interest in designing multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance . And some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others . Some of the groupings we find are surprising .
[INTRODUCTION] The key requirement to being able to implement this approach is having a large collection of barcoded mutants and the ability to re-measure their fitness , relative to a reference strain , in multiple environments , such as the 12 different combinations and concentrations of drugs surveyed here . By grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs , we reduce the number of unique drug-resistant mutants from more than can be easily phenotyped ( 774 ) to a manageable panel of six types for investigating the molecular mechanisms by which mutations impact fitness . This inverted approach to investigating the mechanisms by which mutations affect fitness has broad applications ; it could be used to characterize dominant negative mutations , mutations with collateral fitness effects , and in other high-throughput mutational scanning studies . Thus , in the clinic , and in laboratory experiments , the same drug-resistant mutations repeatedly emerge , potentially leading to the false impression that the mechanistic basis of resistance to a particular drug , and the associated tradeoffs , are less varied than may be true . Typical phenotyping methods , for example quantifying expression levels of drug export pumps or of the drug targets themselves , are low throughput and require some a priori knowledge of the phenotypes that may be involved in drug resistance . In order to design better multidrug treatment strategies that thwart resistance , or to see if such strategies are feasible , we need methods to survey a more complete set of mutations and mechanisms that can contribute to resistance . Laboratory experiments that have power to search for universal tradeoffs - where all the mutants that perform well in one environment perform poorly in another - often find there are mutants that violate trends or the absence of trends altogether . Alternatively , both could provide drug resistance via the same mechanism , but some mutations might also affect fitness via additional mechanisms ( i. e. they might have unique 'side-effects ' at the molecular level ) resulting in unique fitness tradeoffs in some environments . More generally , our work
[RESULTS] Despite the wide interest in this type of fitness data , it is technically challenging to generate , thus many previous studies of fitness profiles focus on a much smaller number of isolates , sometimes with variation restricted to a single gene , or evolved in response to a single selection pressure . For example , we sequenced many FLU-resistant yeast lineages finding 35 with unique single nucleotide mutations in either PDR1 or PDR3 , and a few with mutations in SUR1 or UPC2 , genes which have all been shown to contribute to FLU resistance in previous work . More recent studies refer to the changing performance of
[DISCUSSION] We confirmed that each group captures mutants with distinct properties using multiple approaches , including whole genome sequencing , growth curve experiments , tracing the evolutionary origins of the mutants in each cluster , and by using two additional independent clustering methods : hierarchical clustering and PCA ( Figures 5-8 ) . All of the aforementioned observations combined suggest that there are more unique types of FLU-resistant mutations than those represented by these 6 clusters , and that the molecular mechanisms that can contribute to fitness in FLU are more diverse than we know . On the other hand , the observation that some mutants have very similar tradeoffs such that they cluster together is promising in that it suggests predicting the impact of some mutations by understanding the impacts of others is somewhat feasible . Our results encourage more complex strategies
[METHODS] We sampled either 1 or 2 thousand cells per each evolution experiment by spreading frozen stock from the chosen time point onto agarose plates , scraping 1 or 2 thousand colonies into a 15 mL conical tube containing a final concentration of 30 % glycerol , and freezing the pool pertaining to each of",,1009,99,None,"Many diseases are caused by mutations in a specific gene , which can cause the cells to become resistant to the drug they are taking . The mutations that cause this resistance can also be harmful to the cells . For example , some mutations can cause cells to develop resistance to a particular drug . However , it is not clear how these mutations affect the fitness of the cells that produce the drug , and how they affect the cells’ fitness . To answer this question , Xiao et al . have developed a method that allows researchers to look at a large number of mutations . This allows them to study the effects of a single mutation on the cells' fitness , as well as how it affects the cells in different environments . In the experiments , the researchers used a technique called lineage-tracking to capture 774 mutants that give yeast cells a fitness advantage in fluconazole , an antifungal drug that is used to treat a variety of illnesses . These mutants were then tested in 12 different environments to see if they were able to survive in one environment , or in another . It was found that some of the mutants with the same gene had different fitness tradeoffs than others , suggesting that the mutations may be more diverse than current data suggests . Moreover , many of these mutants could be found in other environments , such as in the laboratory , where they can be used to study how the cells respond to different drugs . Therefore , these findings could help to design better multidrug therapies that target specific mutations to combat drug resistance ."

[ABSTRACT] Recent results from an auditory delayed comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought : when the posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) was silenced , both short-term and contraction biases were reduced . By proposing a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating the behavior , we show that a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience - producing short-term sensory history biases - naturally leads to contraction bias . Our results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings , delay intervals , as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas . The central tendency bias , or contraction bias , is a phenomenon where the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased toward the average of past observations . It is assumed to be an optimal strategy by the brain and commonly thought of as an expression of the brain 's ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input . On the other hand , recency biases such as serial dependence are also commonly observed and are thought to reflect the content of working memory . The errors , occurring at the level of individual trials , are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory toward the sensory distribution 's mean . Finally , we validate our model by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task .
[INTRODUCTION] Furthermore , using the same model , we also show that the biases toward long-term ( short-term ) statistics inferred from the performance of ASD ( DYS ) subjects may actually reflect short-term biases extending more or less into the past with respect to NT subjects , challenging the hypothesis of a double-dissociation mechanism . We make specific predictions on neuronal dynamics in the PPC and downstream WM areas , as well as how contraction bias may be altered , upon manipulations of the sensory stimulus distribution , intertrial and interstimulus delay intervals . Rather , it may be an effect emerging at the level of average performance , when in each trial errors are made according to the recent sensory experiences whose distribution follow that of the input stimuli . Given the finding that PPC neurons carry more information about stimuli presented during previous trials , the PPC module integrates inputs over a longer timescale relative to the WM network and incorporates firing rate adaptation . Repeatedly observed across species and sensory modalities is the central tendency ( 'contraction ' ) bias , where performance in perceptual tasks seemingly reflects a shift of the working memory ( WM ) representation toward the mean of the sensory history . In another recent study with humans , a double dissociation was reported between three cohorts of subjects : subjects on the autistic spectrum ( ASD ) expressed reduced biases due to recent statistics , whereas dyslexic subjects ( DYS ) expressed reduced biases toward long-term statistics , relative to neurotypical subjects ( NT ) . Recent evidence , however , challenges this picture : our recent study of a parametric working memory ( PWM ) task discovered that the rat posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) plays a key role in modulating contraction bias . It is commonly thought that these biases occur due to disparate mechanisms - contraction bias is widely thought to be a result of learning the statistical structure of the environment , whereas serial biases are thought to reflect the contents of WM . We conclude that contraction biases in such paradigms may not necessarily reflect explicit learning of regularities or an 'attraction
[RESULTS] As in the study in Akrami et al. , 2018 using an interleaved design , across consecutive trials , the interstimulus delay intervals are randomized and sampled uniformly between 2 , 6 , and 10 s. The intertrial interval ( ITI ) , instead , is fixed at 5 s. We additionally include psychometric pairs ( indicated in the box in Figure 1B ) where the distance to the diagonal , hence the discrimination difficulty , is varied . Note , however , that in these two specific trials the activity bump in PPC is strong and it displaces the activity bump in the WM network , but this is not the only kind
[DISCUSSION] Recently , Akrami et al. , 2018 found that contraction bias as well as short-term history-dependent effects occur in an auditory delayed comparison task in rats and humans : the comparison performance in a given trial depends on the stimuli shown in preceding trials ( up to three trials back ) , similar to previous findings in human 2AFC paradigms . The abstract mathematical model that we present ( Figure 4 ) can be compatible with a Bayesian framework in the limit of a very broad likelihood for the first stimulus and a very narrow one for the second stimulus , and where the prior for the first stimulus is replaced by the distribution of s^ , following the model in Figure 4B ( see section 'The probability to make errors is proportional to the cumulative distribution of the stimuli , giving rise to contraction bias ' for
[METHODS] Therefore , the probability that the Bayesian decision maker yields the response 's1 < s2 ' given the true values of the stimuli s1 and s2 are the average of the label y^ over the possible values of their representations , that is , over the likelihood : ( 12 ) p ( y^=1|s1 , s2",,987,98,None,"In humans , the average amount of items held in working memory appears to be based on the average of past observations . This bias is thought to be due to the brain’s ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input , but it is also thought to reflect the content of working memory . The central tendency bias is a phenomenon where the judgment of the magnitude of items stored in working memories appears to shift toward the average . It is commonly thought that this bias occurs due to differences in brain activity . However , recent research has shown that the central tendency ( contraction bias ) bias is more common in humans than in animals . In a recent study , researchers found that the posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) plays a key role in modulating contraction bias in rats . Previous studies have shown that when the PPC was silenced , both short-term and contraction biases were reduced . Now , Wang et al . have used a model of the brain that may be involved in this process . To test this , they used rats to perform an auditory task , which involves a task that involves the ability to remember information about the past . These rats were given a test that was repeated over a period of time , and the results showed that the rats performed better in the task compared to those who did not . Moreover , these rats were able to perform the task in the same way that humans did . Wang "

[ABSTRACT] Mechanistically , nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) expression , suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells , and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration , turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) including those unleashed by ICIs . Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system , we investigated the therapeutic efficacy , action mechanism , and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles ( nanoPDLIM2 ) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs . We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 ( PDLIM2 ) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance , suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement . NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity , high tumor specificity , antitumor activity , and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs , with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination . These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers . In this study , human clinical samples and data were used to investigate PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer . Immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy , fail in most cancer patients . Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration .
[INTRODUCTION] Although these outcomes may be improved by immune checkpoint blockade therapy involving the disruption of the binding of programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1 , also known as CD279 ) on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) to programmed death receptor ligand 1 ( PD-L1 , also known as B7-H1 or CD274 ) on tumor and tumor-associated cells , most lung cancer patients still fail the therapy , with a response rate of only about 20 % . Our recent human and mouse studies have shown that most lung tumors not only have low TILs and decreased PD-L1 , but also down-regulate major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) , evading recognition and attack by CD8+ T cells , including those unleashed by ICIs and/or recruited by chemotherapy . Following our previous cell line studies , we have established the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein PDLIM2 , also known as SLIM or mystique , as a bona fide tumor suppressor and its repression as a causative driver of lung cancer and resistance to ICIs and chemotherapeutic agents . One most important function of PDLIM2 is to promote the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of nuclear signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) and nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) RelA ( also known as p65 ) , two master transcription factors that function as proto-oncogenes in lung and many other cancers . Notably , systemic administration of nanoPDLIM2 reverses the phenotypes caused by PDLIM2 repression and induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most mice without further increasing toxicity when combined with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs . While PDLIM2 is epigenetically repressed in human lung cancer , associating with therapeutic resistance and poor prognosis , its global or lung epithelial-specific deletion in mice leads to lung cancer development , chemoresistance , and complete resistance to anti-PD-1 and epigenetic drugs . Given its roles in inducing TILs and immunogenicity , in particular PD-L1 expression , to turn cold tumors hot , chemotherapy can be an ideal candidate for combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to improve therapeutic efficacy . These studies indicate that besides epigenetic repression , loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) contributes
[RESULTS] In further support of the lung tumor-specific delivery , the i. v. injection of either PDLIM2-expression or control plasmid nanoparticles showed no obvious toxicity to animals , as evidenced by no significant changes in the animal body weight and histology of all organs/tissues we examined , including spleen , kidney and liver ( Figure 3D and E ) . Given their overlapping roles in increasing TILs and in particular their complement roles in inducing MHC-I and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells , which turn tumors hot and more sensitive to PD-1 blockade , combination of nanoPDLIM2 and chemotherapeutic drugs with anti-PD-1 is expected to show better efficacy compared to combining only two
[DISCUSSION] Using an authentic mouse model of lung cancer , we show , for the first time , that PDLIM2 nanotherapy shows efficacy and high safety , and more importantly , induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals when it is combined with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs . Most human lung tumors as well as lung tumors in our animal model have low numbers of TILs and decreased expression of PD-L1 and MHC-I on the cell surface , all of which are important mechanisms contributing to the resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy . More importantly , these preclinical data establish a novel combination treatment of nanoPDLIM2 , anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs that induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals and is also with high safety profile . Besides its side effects , epigenetic therapy should have much more limited application ,
[METHODS] Genomic DNAs were isolated from human lung tumors and their matched normal tissues using the PureLink Genomic DNA Purification Kit ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , and subjected to semi-quantitative PCR using the primers specific for the microsatellite markers D8S1786 and D8S1752 that straddle the PDLIM2 genetic locus or the PDLIM2",,991,98,None,"Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people worldwide , and it is the leading cause of death in the United States . However , it is also a major cause of lung cancer , which can be fatal if not treated properly . The immune system is able to block the growth of tumors by blocking the activity of a protein called PDLIM2 . This protein is known as a bona fide tumor suppressor , but it is not known how it is repressed in lung cancer patients . In this study , the researchers used a mouse model of human lung cancer to study the effects of repression on the protein . Using a technique called nanoparticles , they injected the protein into the cells of mice with a drug called PD-1 . These plasmids were then injected into the lung cells of the mice , causing them to be more sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs , such as anti-PD-1 antibodies . When the mice were treated with the drug , their tumors were completely remissioned , with the remaining mice being able , however , to survive . To test the effectiveness of the treatment , Draper et al . used the mouse model to show that the repressive protein , known as nanoPDLIM2 ( SLIM or mystique ) , was a new target for lung cancer therapy . It was found to be a key component of the immune system , as well as regulating the expression of many genes , including the genes that are important for survival . While the results of this study were not yet known , these findings suggest that a combination of drugs containing a molecule called nanoPDLM2 could be used to treat lung cancer and other cold cancer"

[ABSTRACT] The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis , particularly its neuronal function , which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors . However , the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system , which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior , are still not fully understood . This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food , thereby enhancing survival in natural environments . Moreover , animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation , which inhibits the UPRER -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis . Here , we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E. coli ) , a low-sugar food , triggers cellular UPRER and immune response . To survive in challenging environments , animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly . This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food .
[INTRODUCTION] More specifically , while cellular stress response through UPRER and PMK-1/p38 MAPK -dependent immunity in response to pathogens have been extensively studied , the functions of these cellular stress response in sensing and evaluating specific nutrients from food remain unclear . Besides these sensory systems that facilitate quick feeding decisions , animals may also initiate cellular stress response programs to detect nutrition/toxin and trigger food response behaviors . This pathway assesses the deficiency of D-glucose in food and the subsequent vitamin C content in animals through the unfolded protein response ( UPRER ) - innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis . However , the signaling events in cellular stress responses involved in evaluating of specific nutrients and the mechanisms that connect these signaling activities to food behaviors are largely unexplored . In this study , using the low-quality food evaluation assay system we established , we elucidated the mechanism by which the cellular stress response pathway operates as a physiological food evaluation system . However , the potential involvement of the cellular stress response pathway in this food evaluation system for sensing and assessing vitamin C remains largely unexplored . Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient that can not be synthesized by humans due to the loss of a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway . This system enables them to identify nutrient-rich food and avoids low-quality or toxic food , thereby maximizing their survival prospects . Therefore , in animals , having robust food evaluation systems to detect vitamin C levels could significantly impact their survival in the wild . Various sensory neuron evaluation systems in animals has evolved to evaluate food quality through vision , olfactory and gustatory senses . This mechanism promotes animals to leave low-quality food and is critical for their survival in nature environments . Vitamin C is an important physiological antioxidant and a cofactor for a family of biosynthetic and gene regulatory monooxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes . This could be one of physiological food quality evaluation systems that monitor the nutritional status of consumed food . Vitamin C has been associated with various human diseases including scurvy , immune defect and cardiovascular disease . To adapt to fluctuating environments with a wide range of food sources , animals have developed a food evaluation system . It is also required for the biosynthesis of collagen , L-carnitine , and
[RESULTS] Consistent with the results of the RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) analysis , the UPRER reporter ( Phsp-4 : :GFP ) and immunity reporter ( Pirg-5 : :GFP ) were strongly induced in intestine ( Figure 1F-G ) and neurons ( Figure 1-figure supplement 2A ) by feeding unfavorable food ( HK-E. coli OP50 ) , suggesting that UPRER and immune pathways may respond to low-quality food ( HK-E. coli OP50 ) . However , this preference was also rescued in xbp-1 or pmk-1 mutant animals by expressing XBP-1 or PMK-1 in neurons rather than intestine ( Figure 5B-D ) , indicating that neuronal XBP-1 and PMK-1 are critical for physiological food elevation system for monitoring the level of sugar and VC under
[DISCUSSION] In contrast , our study reveals a new mechanism where the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) positively regulates Innate Immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) under HK-E. coli food conditions , establishing a novel physiological food evaluation system that activates the cellular stress response program . The disruption of cellular homeostasis by ingested of low-quality or toxic food can activate stress response mechanisms that both increase the cellular ability to withstand and adapt to this disruption of homeostasis and promote behavioral strategies to avoid these conditions and lessen their impact on the organism . This study identified a physiological food evaluation mechanism by which animals recognize food quality through UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) regulated cellular stress response program in neurons that dictates food avoidance and selection behaviors ( Figure 6 ) . Unlike the sensory neuron evaluation system , which permits rapid feeding decisions through smell and taste , the cellular stress response as
[METHODS] To measure the level of protein translation , worms ( feeding different food for 24 hr ) were analyzed by standard western blot methods and probed with anti-Puromycin ( dilution = 1:10 , 000 ; Sigma-Aldrich , MABE343 ) and anti-α-tubulin as a loading control . ( 1 ) The following strains/alleles were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center ( CGC",,952,96,None,"In order to survive in a challenging environment , animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly .

It is also important for animals to avoid harmful substances , such as toxic chemicals , because it is not possible to synthesize vitamin C .

[ABSTRACT] Integrating molecular dynamics simulation with functional study , we identified the uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) -sugar-binding site on P2Y14 , and revealed that a UDP-glucose might activate the receptor by bridging the transmembrane ( TM ) helices 2 and 7 . We identified the KDKE chain as a conserved functional motif of sugar binding for both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ) , and then designed three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12 . Here , we employed P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ) , a drug target for inflammation and immune responses , to uncover the sugar nucleotide activation of GPCRs . These results not only expand our understanding for activation of purinergic receptors but also provide insights for the carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs . However , it remains largely unknown how carbohydrates directly modulate important drug targets , such as G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . As a major class of biomolecules , carbohydrates play indispensable roles in various biological processes . Between TM2 and TM7 of P2Y14 , a conserved salt bridging chain ( K2 . 36 [ KDKE ] ) was identified to distinguish different UDP-sugars , including UDP-glucose , UDP-galactose , UDP-glucuronic acid , and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine . 60-D2 . 64-K7 . 35-E7 .
[INTRODUCTION] The crystal structures of P2Y12 show that a full agonist 2-methylthio-adenosine-5'-diphosphate ( 2MeSADP , a close analogue of ADP ) binds to an extracellular pocket consisting of transmembrane ( TM ) helices and extracellular loops . As an isomer of UDP-Glc , UDP-Gal is present in various cell models , including physiologically relevant primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells . As the closest homolog to P2Y14 , P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ) has not been reported to be activated by any sugar nucleotide . 67 % amino acid sequence identity , it would be interesting to investigate whether this receptor is also sensible to sugar nucleotides . However , it is still elusive how carbohydrates directly act on major therapeutic targets , including G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . As significant components of the organism , carbohydrates play indispensable roles in energy supply , cell signaling , and immune responses . The ligand-binding models of different UDP-sugars ( UDP-Glc , UDP-Gal , UDP-GlcA , and UDP-GlcNAc ) were quantitatively characterized to identify the sugar recognition site of P2Y14 . Here , we combined molecular docking , molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations , and functional study to reveal the molecular mechanism how P2Y14 is activated by a sugar nucleotide . It belongs to P2Y purinoceptor subfamily , consisting of receptors responding to nucleotides , including adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and UDP . Distinct from the other purinoceptors , P2Y14 is potently activated by UDP and a class of carbohydrates , that is , UDP-sugars . The reported agonist-bound structures of P2Y12 provide insights to understand the nucleotide activation of P2Y purinoceptors . P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ) represents an outstanding model system for understanding carbohydrate modulation of GPCRs . These sugar nucleotides act as important signaling molecules via P2Y14 to mediate many physiological processes . Particularly , UDP-Glc regulates immune responses and associate with asthma , kidney injury , and lung inflammation . Multiple carbohydrates were designed and validated as their agonists targeting the conserved functional motif . Dysregulation of carbohydrates has been proved to be associated with the development of various diseases . Both P2Y14 and P2Y12 were employed to unveil a conserved sugar-binding motif . It remains unknown how these sugar nucleotides are recognized by P2Y14 . UDP-sugars activate
[RESULTS] 36 formed hydrogen bonds with the glucose 6 ' hydroxyl group of UDP-Glc to keep TM7 close to the receptor core ( Figure 2B and C ) , and an arginine residue formed a salt bridge with the phosphate group of UDP-Glc to stabilize the inward shift of TM6 ( Figure 2B and C ) . 59 made stable hydrophobic interactions to maintain the tight compact between TM5 and TM6 in UDP-Glc-bound-P2Y14 simulations , while TM6 did not interact with TM5 at the extracellular side in the apo simulations ( Figure 2-figure supplement 1A , B ) . These findings not only validate our assumption that P2Y12 can be activated by sugar nucleotides , but also indicate the conserved KDKE
[DISCUSSION] Consistent with our observations , a previous structure-activity relationship study revealed that selective mono-fluorination of the 6 ' hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety results to fourfold less potency on P2Y14 . The KDKE motif not only participates in receptor activation by bridging TM2 and TM7 ( Figure 2 ) , but also recognize different sugar moieties , including glucose , galactose , glucuronic acid , and N-acetylglucosamine groups ( Figure 3 , Figure 4 ) . Exerting excessive P2Y14-mediated inflammatory reactions , high concentration of UDP-sugars was observed in extracellular tissue surrounding airway epithelial cells and lung secretions of cystic fibrosis patients . found that kidney collecting duct intercalated cells present high levels of P2Y14 , which is activated by UDP-Glc to promote neutrophil infiltration and renal inflammation . In addition , in the studies involving the other UDP-sugars , we also found that the interactions between sugar-moieties of agonists with TM7 is determinant for

One of the most important molecules in the human body is the G-protein coupled receptor ( GPCR ) which is a type of receptor that is responsible for regulating the immune system . GPCRs are a group of receptors that respond to sugars and other chemical signals . They are also known as purinoceptors and are involved in a number of different processes .

This revealed that sugars are important components of the cell’s signaling system , but that they are also important for other processes , like inflammation and immune responses . Using this simulation , we were able to identify the sugars on the receptor that are activated . We also identified a protein called KDKE that is involved in the binding of sugar to the receptor .

[ABSTRACT] The knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD+ level , which leads to the low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei . Here , we show that ferritin produced by glia , cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for the energy production , which is essential to the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs . In this study , we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable to maintain the self-renewal of NBs , unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development . Drosophila neural stem cells ( Neuroblasts , NBs ) are encased by glial niche cells closely , but it still remains unclear whether glial niche cells can regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs . In addition , the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs , establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis . Stem cell niche is critical for regulating the behavior of stem cells . More importantly , ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression .
[INTRODUCTION] The diversity and complexity of these cell populations confer niche the ability to integrate local and systemic signals , but make it complicated to study the interaction between niches and NSCs in mammals , which is a critical issue in understanding neurogenesis and improving clinical applications of NSCs . Here , we show that glial ferritin supplies iron into NBs to form iron-sulfur ( Fe-S ) clusters , which is necessary for the production of ATP , providing the energy required for self-renewal and proliferation of NBs , highlighting ferritin as a potential target for suppressing tumor . Drosophila larval central nervous system ( CNS ) , composed of the central brain ( CB ) , optic lobe ( OL ) , and ventral nerve cord ( VNC ) , is a simple but sophisticated model to decipher the regulatory mechanisms underlying NSC behaviors mediated by niche signals . Previous researches have shown that Drosophila ferritin not only directly participates in dietary iron absorption by removing iron from enterocytes across the basolateral membrane , but competes with transferrin to deliver iron between the gut and the fat body . The mammalian NSC niche found in the neurogenic regions is composed of diverse cell types including choroid plexus , vascular endothelia cells , pericytes , microglia , and meninges , which regulate NSC behaviors such as proliferation , self-renewal , and differentiation . Iron is a vital micronutrient for almost all living organisms since it participates in many crucial biological processes , including mitochondrial electron transport and cellular respiration that both support ATP production used for most cellular activities . In Drosophila , these subunits are encoded by ferritin 1 heavy chain homolog ( Fer1HCH ) and ferritin 2 light chain homolog ( Fer2LCH ) , respectively , which both contain secretion signal peptides that direct them to the ER during translation . Ferritin , a ubiquitous protein present in most organisms , is composed of 24 subunits that assemble into a hollow-sphere complex capable of storing up to 4500 iron atoms in a bioavailable form . Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) possess the remarkable ability to self-renew for maintaining their identity and differentiate into diverse neural cell types required for neurogenesis during brain development . These glial cells not only form the physical support structure for NBs , but also provide extrinsic cues that
[RESULTS] To investigate whether the ferritin was transported from glia to NBs via the vesicular transport , we expressed a temperature-sensitive dominant-negative Shibire dynamin protein ( shits ) to block vesicle trafficking from glial cells , and found that Fer1HCH : :GFP accumulated in glia , accompanying with significantly diminished Fer1HCH signal in NBs ( Figure 2D , D ' and E ) , suggesting glial ferritin secretes into NBs through vesicle system . To exclude the possibility of RNAi off-target effects , we used repo-GAL4 to overexpress RNAi-resistant Fer1HCH ( or Fer2LCH ) containing silent mutations in the region targeted by shRNA , which resulted in a significant increase in the number and proliferation rate of NBs compared to glial ferritin knockdown alone
[DISCUSSION] In this study , we demonstrate that the glial niche maintains the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs through supplying the necessary microelement iron into NBs for enough energy production , which implies that mammalian glia likewise provide critical microelement for maintaining NSC function . Our study shows that the block of ferritin or iron can inhibit tumors effectively , which offers an explanation that ferritin targets on the tumor is to transport iron for maintaining the cell proliferation , highlighting a potential target for tumor suppression . In this way , BBB glia separates the labile systemic iron from local iron inside the brain to guarantee the normal brain development , as the neural cells , including NBs , require a stable iron level for continuous energy generation during neurogenesis . Our results show that ferritin generated outside the brain was not detected in the CNS and vice versa ( data not shown ) , suggesting ferritin can hardly
[METHODS] The cDNA with silent mutations was synthesized by Sangon Biotech ( Shanghai ) Co. , Ltd. To generate transgenic fly lines of lexAop-Fer1HCH-RNAi and lexAop-Fer2LCH-RNAi , the shRNA sequences targeted on Fer1HCH and Fer2LCH were generated by PCR amplification of UAS-Fer1HCH-RNAi and UAS-Fer2LCH-RNAi DNA using primers ( 5'- ACGGAGCGACAATTCAATTCA-3'/5'-TGATGCCTACCTGATGCCAA-3 ' ) , respectively . The eggs of tubulin-GAL80ts ; repo-gal4 crossing",,953,96,None,"Neuroblasts , or neural stem cells , are a group of cells in the brain that are responsible for repairing and repairing damaged brain structures . These cells are known as neural stem cell niches . They are able to produce ATP , which is needed for the production of energy . However , it is not clear whether these cells can regulate the activity of these cells . In the fruit fly Drosophila , a protein called ferritin is found in the glial cells of the brain . This protein is made from a complex of proteins called subunits that assemble into a hollow-sphere complex . The complex consists of 24 proteins , each with a specific function . Ferritin , however , is not found in all cells in mammals , and it is unclear whether it can be used as a target for cancer . To investigate this question , Liu et al . used fruit flies to develop a new model of the nervous system of the fruitfly , called the central nervous system ( CNS ) . Using a mouse model , the experiments show that a small protein called glia binds to a subunit of ferritol , an iron-containing protein . Liu and Liu found that glioblasts produce a type of protein that is essential for the development of the CNS: a molecule called aconitase . When the molecule is blocked , this causes the cells to lose their ability to produce the energy they need to grow and develop . Further experiments showed that , when the glucose-like protein , named Zip13 , was added to the cytoplasm of the NBs "

[ABSTRACT] Cancer is considered a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality , yet several countries have reported that deaths with a primary code of cancer remained within historic levels during the COVID-19 pandemic . To understand these differences , we simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates , life expectancy , population size , and mean age of individuals living with each condition . We find that the observed mortality differences are primarily explained by differences in life expectancy , with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19 . We compared pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause ( MC ) death data for six types of cancer , diabetes , and Alzheimer 's . Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers ( breast , colorectal , and hematological , 2-7 % ) than cancers with a poor survival rate ( lung and pancreatic , 0-1 % ) . Nationally in 2020 , MC cancer mortality rose by only 3 % over a pre-pandemic baseline , corresponding to ~13 , 600 excess deaths . Here , we further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US . Any pandemic-related changes in coding practices should be eliminated by study of MC data . In comparison , there was substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes ( 37 % ) and Alzheimer 's ( 19 % ) .
[INTRODUCTION] To further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level , we analyzed US vital statistics in detail to understand the potential role of death certificate coding changes during the pandemic and explored putative differences in mortality patterns between different types of cancer . This hypothesis was put forward to explain the observed absence in excess cancer mortality during the 1968 influenza pandemic , a departure from elevated mortality seen for other high-risk conditions such as heart disease and diabetes . Assuming there is a high propensity to attribute a primary code of COVID-19 during the pandemic in any patient with COVID-19 , deaths among individuals with both cancer and COVID-19 near the time of death would be coded as UC COVID-19 . For comparison , we also assessed population-level excess mortality patterns for other chronic conditions such as diabetes , ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) , kidney disease , and Alzheimer 's , for which the association with COVID-19 is less debated . The dominant risk factors for COVID-19 mortality have consistently been shown to be advanced age , male gender , and certain chronic diseases such as diabetes , obesity , and heart disease . In several other countries , including Sweden , Italy , Latvia , Brazil , England , and Wales , underlying cancer mortality was found to be stable or decreasing during the first year of the pandemic . The US provides a particularly useful case study as the timing of COVID-19 waves varied considerably between states , so that elevations in cancer deaths , should they exist , should also be heterogeneous . Further , an excess mortality study of 240 , 000 cancer patients in Belgium found a 33 % rise in mortality in April 2020 , but concluded that this was no different from the rise observed in the general population . Taken together , such observational studies provide a mixed picture of cancer as a COVID-19 mortality risk factor , with several studies reporting that controlling for important factors such as age is a challenge . A recent US study showed no elevation in underlying cancer deaths concomitant with COVID-19 waves , in stark contrast to the sharp rise in mortality from other chronic diseases . In a large cohort study of ~500 , 000 COVID-19 inpatients
[RESULTS] In national data , time series of COVID-19-coded death certificates ( both UC and MC ) tracked with the temporal patterns of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases ( Figure 1 ) , revealing three distinct COVID-19 waves : a spring wave peaking on April 12 , 2020 , a smaller summer wave peaking on July 26 , 2020 , and a large winter wave that had not yet peaked by the end of the study in December 2020 . For instance , even if cancer increases COVID-19 mortality risk by a factor of 2 , we expect to see only a 0-1 % increase for particularly deadly cancers such as pancreatic and lung cancer , in part driven by the high competing risk of
[DISCUSSION] In contrast to earlier studies , we propose that lack of excess cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic reflects the competing mortality risk from cancer ( especially for deadly types like pancreatic and lung cancers ) itself rather than protection conferred from immunosuppression . We note the more pronounced elevation in mortality from hematological cancers during the pandemic , compared to other cancers and to expectations from a demographic model , which aligns with a particular group of cancer patients singled out in several cohort studies . Future research on the relationship between COVID-19 and cancer should concentrate on additional outcomes , such as excess hospitalizations , Long COVID , changes in screening practices during COVID-19 , and longer-term patterns in cancer mortality . Our detailed excess mortality study considered six cancer types and found that there is at most a modest elevation in cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US . Our results demonstrate the",,944,96,None,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world . However , it is not clear how many people die from cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic . The most common cause of death is cancer , which can be fatal if left untreated . In the US , for example , the number of deaths from cancer in the US rose by only 3% in 2020 , compared to a pre-pandemic baseline of 13 , 600 deaths . This suggests that the risk of death from cancer is much higher than the risk from cancer . But , in other countries , there was a significant increase in deaths from diabetes and Alzheimer’s , but this was not the case in the United States . To understand the relationship between cancer mortality and COVId-19 , Weiss et al . compared the death certificates of individuals living with six different types of cancer and found that they were more likely to die of cancer than those with a poor survival rate . These differences were mainly explained by differences in life expectancy , with cancers that are less deadly than those that are more deadly than others . For example : breast , colorectal , and hematological cancers were the most common cancers in the population , while cancers with poor survival rates were the least common . Further , these differences were more pronounced for the more deadly cancers than the more common ones . Overall , our results suggest that , even if there is a high proportion of people who die from the disease , they should be treated with caution ."

[ABSTRACT] Consistent with this , budding yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong synthetic interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in their chromosomes . While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established , there is still an incomplete understanding of the cellular processes responsible for their removal from eukaryotic genomes . Importantly , we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme in vitro . Here , we show that a core regulator of chromosome architecture -the Smc5/6 complex- plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription . Collectively , our results reveal a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres . The R-loop is a common transcriptional by-product that consists of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA .
[INTRODUCTION] In addition , factors associated with transcription and mRNA biogenesis , RNA-DNA helicases , topoisomerases , chromatin remodelers , and several DNA repair enzymes are known to be involved alongside RNase H in preventing the accumulation of R-loop structures in eukaryotic chromosomes . To mitigate the toxic consequences associated with the presence of unprogrammed RNA-DNA hybrids in chromosomes , several cellular mechanisms work in concert to prevent their formation , and when they do accumulate , remove them from eukaryotic genomes . Recent evidence suggests that the Smc5/6 complex is a DNA compacting enzyme that acts in vivo by regulating local chromatin domains containing unusual DNA structures that can lead to replication stress and/or DNA damage . The Smc5/6 complex is a particularly intriguing member of this family because its function -unlike that of cohesin and condensin- is primarily concerned with DNA repair , and yet its exact contribution to this process is not fully understood . In particular , we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to R-loop structures formed during active gene transcription and promotes RNase H2-mediated degradation of the RNA component of R-loops . However , the formation of unprogrammed or non-physiological RNA-DNA hybrid structures can interfere with DNA replication-related processes , resulting in replicative stress and the formation of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . During transcription , nascent RNA transcripts can re-anneal to complementary DNA strands producing an RNA-DNA hybrid and displace the template strand , creating an obstacle to the progression of the DNA replication machinery . Examples include trinucleotide repeat-associated diseases , auto-immune disorders , neurological disorders , and cancer , although it is not currently known whether R-loops play a causative or consequential role in such diseases . Our results unravel a hitherto unanticipated role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of RNA structures from chromosomes , an essential function for the maintenance of genome integrity and cell fitness . RNA-DNA hybrid structures can also be formed under a variety of physiological conditions in eukaryotic genomes and play important roles in cell physiology and regulate genome dynamics . Importantly , exposed ssDNA in the R-loop can be cleaved by different endonucleases leading to DNA breaks and/or mutagenic events , and can also adopt harmful secondary structures . Interestingly , genome-wide screens as well as targeted genetic analyses revealed synthetic interactions among a subset of mutants affecting Smc5/6 complex
[RESULTS] To test the possibility that the SMC5/6 complex modulates RNase H2 activity by direct binding , we performed an in vitro pull-down assay and found no detectable physical interaction connecting these proteins , a result further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays from yeast extracts ( Figure 6-figure supplement 2A-B ) . The proliferation rate of the Smc5/6-RNase H double mutants was compared to that of parental single mutants at various temperatures ( 23 °C , 30 °C , and 32 °C ) and in the presence of DNA-damaging agents ( hydroxyurea [ HU ] , 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide [ 4NQO ] , and methyl methanesulfonate [ MMS ] ) ( Figure 1C and D and Figure 1-figure supplement 1A ) . Extensive research over recent years
[DISCUSSION] As such , the exacerbation of the DNA damage sensitivity of RNase H mutants by temperature-sensitive alleles of the Smc5/6 complex may be the consequence of their effects on RNA-DNA hybrid removal ( i. e. , thus reflecting a 'within pathway ' contribution relative to RNase H1/H2 ) and their roles in additional biochemical pathways distinct from RNA-DNA hybrid degradation but still relevant to R-loop detoxification . The implication for the Smc5/6 complex is that it is probably not required to stimulate RNase H2 activity in all contexts in vivo but is likely more important in challenging environments where R-loops are highly abundant or otherwise difficult to degrade effectively by RNase H2 alone . Hints of a potential mechanism of action come from the observation that one of the enzymes responsible for R-loop degradation , RNase H1 , shows little enzymatic activity under basal conditions and requires stimulation by ancillary factors , such as RPA , to achieve maximal R-loop degradation
[METHODS] The reactions were then loaded on an 4-12 % Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel and ran in 1 x MOPS buffer for 2 hr at 120 Volts , before being analyzed by immunoblotting with 1:2500 dilution of anti-HIS antibody .

This strand can be re-annealed to produce a new strand that can then be used as a template for other RNA molecules .

[ABSTRACT] Longitudinally , however , our results raise caution on attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour : neither neural filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change could predict individual 2-year behavioural change , under a combination of modelling strategies . We here show that individual listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories modelling electroencephalographic and behavioural data of N = 105 ageing individuals ( 39-82 y ) . To this end , the age-typical loss of sensory acuity might in part be compensated for by an individual 's preserved attentional neural filtering . First , despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity , listening-task performance proved stable over 2 y . Second , neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint ( T1 , T2 ) . Is such a compensatory brain-behaviour link longitudinally stable ? Can it predict individual change in listening behaviour ? Preserved communication abilities promote healthy ageing .
[INTRODUCTION] A growing body of evidence suggests that speech comprehension is neurally supported by an attention-guided filter mechanism that modulates sensory gain and arises from primary auditory and perisylvian brain regions : by synchronising its neural activity with the temporal structure of the speech signal of interest , the brain 'tracks ' and thereby better encodes behaviourally relevant auditory inputs to enable attentive listening . Third , leveraging the strengths of latent change score modelling ( LCSM ) , we fuse cross-sectional and longitudinal perspectives to probe the role of neural filtering as a precursor of behavioural change in two different ways : we ask whether an individual 's T1 neural filtering strength can predict the observed behavioural longitudinal change ( Q3 ) , and whether 2-year change in neural filtering can explain concurrent change in listening behaviour ( Q4 ) . Here , irrespective of the observed magnitude and direction of T1-T2 developments , two scenarios are conceivable : Intra-individual neural and behavioural change may be either be correlated-lending support to a compensatory role of neural filtering-or instead follow independent trajectories . In a large age-varying cohort ( N = 155 ; 39-80 y ) , we have previously shown how the fidelity of this neural filtering strategy can help explain differences in listening behaviour ( i ) from individual to individual and ( ii ) within individuals from sentence to sentence . However , it has long been recognised that increasing age and hearing loss can not fully account for the considerable degree of inter-individual differences observed in listening behaviour and its lifespan change . Using auditory cognition as a model system , we here aim to overcome this limitation by testing directly the hitherto unknown longitudinal stability of neural filtering as a neural compensatory mechanism upholding communication success . The observation of such brain-behaviour relationships critically advances our understanding of the neurobiological foundation of cognitive functioning by showing , for example , how neural implementations of auditory selective attention support attentive listening . More importantly , we also ask how they change longitudinally across the studied 2-year period ( Figure 1C , Q1 ) , and whether ageing individuals differ significantly in their degree of change ( Q2 ) . We here aim to fill this gap by analysing 2-year changes in the sensory , neural , and behavioural domain in a longitudinal subsample ( N = 105 ;
[RESULTS] However , one could ask in how far core methodological decisions taken in the current study , namely our focus on ( i ) the differential neural tracking of relevant vs. irrelevant speech as proxy of neural filtering , and ( ii ) on its trait-level characterisation that averaged across different spatial-attention conditions may have impacted these results . On the basis of the full ( T1 and T2 ) dataset , we aimed to replicate our key T1 results and test whether the previously observed between-subjects brain-behaviour relationship would hold across time : we expected an individual 's neural filtering ability to impact their listening performance ( accuracy and response speed ) independently of age or hearing status . It is in such scenarios
[DISCUSSION] Under this interpretation , the stable link of neural filtering to listening behaviour at different levels of granularity is noteworthy : an individual 's ability to exert top-down selective attention to prioritise the neural encoding of behaviourally relevant information is far from stable but it fluctuates at different time scales . A complete understanding of inter-individual differences in listening behaviour in ageing adults will therefore depend on a number of different factors among which the attention-modulated tracking of relevant speech constitutes one , potentially necessary , but not sufficient neural correlate . Second , it also does not allow the separation of distinct patterns of change co-occurring at the same time : one continuous , constant change with age along with a separate process in which relative change is proportional to the level observed at prior timepoints . However , these studies have ( i ) investigated the temporal stability across sessions spaced only days or weeks apart , ( ii )
[METHODS] This approach was also motivated by previous results based on T1 data : here , we had observed that stronger neural speech tracking led to overall faster and to more trials with accurate responses irrespective of the specific cue-cue condition . The analysed data are part of a large-scale longitudinal study on the neural and cognitive mechanisms supporting adaptive listening behaviour in",,941,95,None,"A person’s ability to listen to a speech is largely dependent on how well he or she is able to hear it . This ability is based on the ability of the brain to ‘track’ the speech , which in turn helps the person to listen more attentively . However , it is not clear how this can be achieved . To investigate this question , Weiss et al . used a technique called latent change score modelling ( LCM ) to study the brain activity of 105 ageing individuals . The experiments show that the brain’s neural filtering ability varies between individuals , and that the changes in the brain over time are correlated only within each individual’s T1 and T2 timepoints . In the experiment , we found that despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity , listening-task performance remained stable over 2 years . We also found that the differences in the ability to hear the speech were largely independent of each other , suggesting that this is a compensatory mechanism . Interestingly , our results suggest that , in addition to the fact that the same brain activity can be used to track the speech of interest , there is also evidence that the ability for a person to retain this ability may also be a factor in how well they listen to the speech they hear ."

[ABSTRACT] In ancient Greece and Rome , illness was thought to arise from imbalance in bodily fluids or humours , yet our study suggests that uses of drugs were based on observed physiological effects that are often consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology . Here , we generate tasting-panel data for botanical drugs and apply phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models to test whether intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities as well as particular tastes and flavours can predict ancient Graeco-Roman drug use . We found chemosensation to be strongly predictive of therapeutic use : botanical drugs with high therapeutic versatility have simple yet intense tastes and flavours , and 21 of 22 chemosensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use . The perception of taste and flavour ( a combination of taste , smell , and chemesthesis ) , here also referred to as chemosensation , enables animals to find high-value foods and avoid toxins . In addition to the common notion of bitter tasting medicines , we also found starchy , musky , sweet , and soapy drugs associated with versatility . Humans have learned to use unpalatable and toxic substances as medicines , yet the importance of chemosensation in this process is poorly understood .
[INTRODUCTION] By applying phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models ( PGLMMs ) to our data and a plant phylogeny , we tested whether perceived taste and flavour qualities , as well as their overall intensity and complexity predict recorded therapeutic uses whilst simultaneously accounting for the confounding effects of the shared uses and chemosensory stimuli by drugs from closely related species . If tastes and flavours , as determined by a modern-day tasting panel , do predict uses as recorded in ancient texts , this would be an unprecedented insight into how chemosensation in combination with physiological effects guided human behaviour in pre-historic times and conditioned therapeutic expectations and humoral theory in historic times . In ancient Greece and Rome , the expected effects of botanical drugs were explained by their taste and according to the prevailing medical theory , disease resulted from a disequilibrium between bodily fluids or humours including phlegm , blood , yellow bile , and black bile ; drugs affected the flow and balance of these humours . While bitter tasting metabolites occurring in fruits and vegetables have been linked with a lower risk for contracting cancer and cardiovascular diseases , the avoidance of pharmacologically active compounds is probably the reason why many medicines , including botanical drugs , taste bitter . The theory of humours was the principal underlying the concept of Western medicine from ancient Graeco-Roman times until the Industrial Age , but as an entirely discredited theory it might be expected that associated practices also lack scientific basis . To test these hypotheses , we assessed the relationships between chemosensory qualities , their intensity , and complexity with therapeutic uses of botanical drugs described in Pedanios Dioscorides ' pharmacognostic compendium , De Materia Medica , the foremost pharmaceutical source of antiquity . We further hypothesise that associations between perceived complexity and intensity of chemosensory qualities of botanical drugs and their versatility ( number of categories of therapeutic use a botanical drug is recommended for ) provide insights into the development of empirical pharmacological knowledge and therapeutic behaviour . The perception of taste and flavour ( a combination of taste , smell , and chemesthesis ) , here also referred to as chemosensation , has evolved to meet nutritional requirements and is particularly important in omnivores for seeking out nutrients and avoiding toxins
[RESULTS] On the other hand , chemosensory complexity ( the number of taste and flavour qualities a botanical drug is scored for , Figure 2b ; see Methods ) is negatively associated with how many different out of the 25 categories of therapeutic use botanical drugs are used for ( e. g. cardiac , gynaecological , humoral , henceforth referred to as 'therapeutic versatility ' ; px = 0 . All therapeutic uses ( with the exception of 'gynaecology - other ' ) are significantly associated with at least one specific chemosensory quality , whether positively ( 99 instances ) or negatively ( 50 instances ) and often with high magnitude of effect ( Figure 3 ; Supplementary file 5 )
[DISCUSSION] While we are aware that the limitation of this study is the impossibility to address all associations found and the dependence on published pharmacological data for the explanatory part , our approach demonstrates the power of phylogenetic methods applied to human behaviour and assessment of plant properties . The therapeutic versatility of drugs perceived as sweet ( 13 positive associations ) and starchy ( 12 positive associations ) ( Figure 3 ; Supplementary files 5 and 6 ) is influenced by the many staples and edible fruits that are also used for medicine ( e. g. protein-rich Fabaceae seeds were often perceived as having starchy tastes ) . 002 ) is explained by uses intended to purge and resolve bitter bile and seems to include what we call choleretics and cholekinetics today , such as the roots of the great yellow gentian ( Gentiana lutea ) or the herb of the common vervain ( Verbena officinalis
[METHODS] The inclusion of plant part and the phylogenetic matrix allowed for the fact that in some cases , multiple drugs were extracted from different parts of the same plant ( e. g. Vitis vinifera ; fruit , leaf , herb , seeds ) whilst still accounting for the overall underlying evolutionary relationships .

[ABSTRACT] Lastly , we find that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions . We define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum , colonization of hemorrhagic lesions , and the consumption of serum nutrients as 'bacterial vampirism ' , which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections . To simulate GI bleeding , we utilized an injection-based microfluidics device and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source . We report the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues . Herein , we report that clinical isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars , Escherichia coli , and Citrobacter koseri are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum . Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae are associated with gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death , from sepsis , for individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases . This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine , an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr . We find Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections . The bacterial behaviors and mechanisms underlying why these bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry remain poorly understood .
[INTRODUCTION] Although severe GI bleeding is not a typical outcome of enteric infection , it is a substantial burden on human health , affecting around 40-150 out of every 100 , 000 individuals annually , with a fatality rate ranging from 6 % to 30 % . These include multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae pathogens of the gut such as Salmonella enterica , Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EHEC ) , Citrobacter koseri , and Enterobacter cloacae , which present major challenges for nosocomial infections and global health . Previously , we determined that most bacterial genera classified by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as 'priority pathogens ' employ chemotaxis systems for efficient infection and exert precise control over their colonization topography . Many enteric pathogens and pathobionts use a form of chemosensing known as chemotaxis to colonize specific tissues , whereby bacteria swim toward or away from sources of exogenous nutrients , toxins , and host-emitted cues . Investigating how chemosensing controls the responses of pathogen populations to chemical features associated with dysbiosis presents an opportunity to gain deeper insights into the critical juncture between infection resolution and exacerbation . Responding to such transient and shifting stimuli is enabled by chemosensing that allows bacteria to rapidly restructure their populations , within seconds , through taxis toward or away from effector sources . Mapping the chemosensing signals enteric bacteria perceive within the host can provide insight into pathogenesis and perhaps be a source of drug targets for inhibiting pathogen navigation and colonization . To address this open question , we elucidated how Enterobacteriaceae species use chemosensing to respond to serum , the molecular mechanism of this response , and how chemosensing is employed to enter and migrate into enterohemorrhagic lesions . Gut dysbiosis-a diseased host state induced by pathologies , inflammation , and infections-exposes enteric bacteria to chemical stimuli distinct from that of a healthy gut that could encourage opportunistic pathogenesis . These findings suggest that environmental stimuli unique to the dysbiotic gut , sensed through bacterial chemosensory systems , can encourage pathogenic behaviors and adverse consequences for the host . Enterobacteriaceae are prone to bloodstream entry and are a leading cause of sepsis-related deaths in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBDs ) that
[RESULTS] Consequently , we can conclude that the correct serine pose and ligand-binding site positions for both models are those we determined using the higher resolution SeTsr structure , in which the L-serine side chain hydroxyl faces outward from the pocket , toward the solvent , and every hydrogen bonding group of the ligand is satisfied by the residues of the binding site ( Figure 7F and J ) . The system and methodology , which we refer to herein as the CIRA , offer several advantages for studying bacterial chemosensing and localization in response to serum : ( 1 ) we can use bona fide human serum , ( 2 ) the readouts are direct measurements
[DISCUSSION] Although the host-derived metabolites NE and DHMA have been reported to be chemoattractants for E. coli sensed directly through Tsr , we were unable to corroborate these results in S. Typhimurium in chemotaxis experiments , nor binding assays with the purified recombinant LBD , despite the high-sequence conservation between the two orthologues ( Figure 4-figure supplement 1 , Figures 7L and M and 8A , https : //public . The specific nutrients responsible for the growth benefits derived from serum remain undefined ; however , one potential candidate is the presence of energy-rich glycoconjugates , which were previously implicated as nutrients for bacteria within the inflamed intestine based on the upregulation of galactose utilization operons and the prevalence of lectin-positive stained tissue . An unanticipated result from obtaining the first structures of SeTsr LBD ( PDB : 8FYV ) is that the well-resolved ligand-binding site contradicts key interactions as they
[METHODS] The sequence of the periplasmic portion of the ligand-binding domain of S. enterica Typhimurium Tsr , corresponding to residues 32-187 of the full-length protein , was encoded into a pet-30a ( + ) vector ( Tsr-LBD-pet-30a ( + ) ) , at the NdeI and HindIII sites , with a short N-terminal TEV cleavage tag ( MENLYFQ",,986,98,None,"Bacteria in the gut are able to colonize specific tissues , such as the intestines and stomach . This allows bacteria to rapidly restructure their populations , which can lead to severe infections . However , it is not clear how these bacteria can be used to invade the body , and how they do so . The bacteria that cause gastrointestinal bleeding are known as Enterobacteriaceae . These bacteria are known to cause severe bowel bleeding , but they are also known to be a leading cause of death for individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases . One of the most common bacteria in the human gut is Salmonella enterica , a family of bacteria that causes severe gastrointestinal hemorrhagic lesions . Infections with Salmonella are caused by a group of bacteria called Enterobacilli , including Escherichia coli and Citrobacter koseri .

[ABSTRACT] We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10 , 000 protein-coding genes , a third of which defines a genetic scaffold of deeply conserved genes that has been retained throughout evolution . These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies . By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity , we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility . However , the unique evolutionary dynamics of male germ cells coupled with their widespread leaky transcription pose significant obstacles to the identification of the core spermatogenic program . Such scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis . Through network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species , we describe the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level . Male germ cells share a common origin across animal species , therefore they likely retain a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity .
[INTRODUCTION] Since the capability to undergo both sexual reproduction and gametogenesis were already present in the unicellular ancestor of all Metazoa , the split between germ line and soma presumably provided early multicellular organisms increased robustness against mutations while minimizing genetic conflict between different cell lineages . At the molecular level , this variation can be mainly traced back to rapid evolutionary changes in gene expression in the testis - likely facilitated by widespread transcriptional leakage in male germ cells - and to the preferential emergence of new genes in this organ , where they often acquire functions in spermatogenesis . This led us to explore the possibility that , despite the rapid evolution of reproductive protein genes , the functional basis of metazoan male germ cell identity relies on an old , evolutionarily conserved genetic program that can provide relevant insight into spermatogenesis and human infertility . First , we determined , through comparison of genome sequences , the age of the gene expression program of male germ cells from three evolutionarily distant metazoan species : humans ( Homo sapiens ) , mice ( Mus musculus ) , and fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ) . Although the rapid divergence of genes directly involved in reproduction has traditionally been interpreted from an adaptationist stance , relaxed selection and drift have been recently proposed to account for this pattern . The fact that transcriptomes tend to cluster by tissue type rather than by species clearly indicates that gene expression identity can be maintained across many million years of evolutionary divergence . Such observation finds parallel in the concept of a metazoan germ line multipotency program , and is supported by transcriptional similarities between equivalent spermatogenic cell types across mammalian species . Overall , we show that deeply conserved genes play a prominent role in male germ cell regulation and that the disruption of this ancient genetic program leads to human reproductive disease . Yet , reproductive protein genes are some of the most rapidly evolving across the tree of life , leading to substantial variation in male reproductive tissues even between closely related species . This echoes the modular nature of eukaryotic biological processes , whose intervening macromolecular complexes are typically built by the addition of younger components to a core block of ancient subunits . Through
[RESULTS] We centered our analysis on three evolutionarily distant gonochoric species with excellent genome annotations - humans , mice , and fruit flies ( the last two also being well-established animal models for the functional study of human spermatogenesis ) - and observed that , as previously reported , male germ cells have a generally more diversified transcriptome than their somatic counterparts ( as measured by the percentage of the entire genome that each cell type expresses ) . To understand to what extent male germ cell transcription quantitatively differs from that of somatic lineages , we collected previously published high-quality RNA-Seq datasets from pre-meiotic , meiotic , and post-meiotic germ cell populations , and compared them with representative somatic cell
[DISCUSSION] Also , this information can potentially be harnessed in other clinically relevant contexts : the spermatocyte orthoBackbone can be further explored to pinpoint key pathways that may facilitate the reconstitution of meiotic entry in vitro , as well as to maximize the effectiveness of exome sequencing approaches in infertile men through the inclusion of the orthoBackbone genes in prioritization lists for disease-causing variants . The latter led to the exclusion of established animal models such as C. elegans ( hermaphrodites ) and zebrafish ( juvenile hermaphrodites ) since it is largely unknown to what extent their male germ cell transcriptome may deviate from the gonochoric program ( by retaining oogenesis-related characteristics , for example ) . The assumed autosomal dominant inheritance of HSPA2 and KPNA2 awaits further confirmation by additional data from independent cohorts and segregation analyses , but stands in line with other well-established male infertility genes such as DMRT1 , NR5A1 , and SYCP2
[METHODS] Phenotypes of all silenced genes associated with decreased reproductive fitness ( 250 in total ) were assigned to one of five classes , based on the earliest stage in which the cytological defects were detected : 1- pre-meiotic ( evidence of increased cell death and/or clear morphological defects in late spermatogonia ) ; 2- meiotic ( failure to progress",,965,97,None,"Male germ cells are a group of cells in the reproductive organs of animals . They are able to reproduce by producing a protein called sperm , which is produced by a cell called a testis . The testis is a part of the body that contains a set of proteins that are used to produce eggs . However , it is not clear how these proteins are produced . In mammals , male germ cells have a similar genetic program to that of females , but they have different levels of genes that are required for the production of eggs and for the reproduction of males . These genes are known as spermatogenesis genes , and they have been linked to human infertility , a condition that affects women and children . To understand how these genes are produced and how they are maintained , Weiss et al . studied the genomes of three different species of mammals . Using a technique called RNA sequencing , we show that the genes that make up male germ cell genes are very similar to those found in other animals , including humans , mice and fruit flies . Weiss 's analysis revealed that the gene that makes up male Germ Cells has been conserved for millions of years . This suggests that the evolution of the genes in male germs may have been influenced by the changes in gene expression in the testis and that this may have contributed to the development of infertile individuals ."

[ABSTRACT] With a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum , we show that the coordinated beating essentially only responds to load exerted on the cis flagellum ; and that such asymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two flagella . The model organism for studying flagellate motility , Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , employs synchronous , breaststroke-like flagellar beating to swim , and it modulates the beating amplitudes differentially to steer . In C. reinhardtii , the synchrony of beating is known to be supported by a mechanical connection between flagella ; however , how flagellar asymmetries persist in the synchrony remains elusive . This strategy hinges on both inherent flagellar asymmetries ( e. g. different response to chemical messengers ) and such asymmetries being effectively coordinated in the synchronous beating . For example , it has been speculated for decades that one flagellum leads the beating , as its dynamic properties ( i. e. frequency , waveform , etc . ) In this study , we combine experiments , computations , and modeling efforts to elucidate the roles played by each flagellum in synchronous beating . Our results highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in coordination and have implication for biflagellates ' tactic behaviors . Eukaryotes swim with coordinated flagellar ( ciliary ) beating and steer by fine-tuning the coordination . appear to be copied by the other one .
[INTRODUCTION] Our numerical approach uses boundary element methods ( BEM ) and slender-body theory ( SBT ) , from which we can directly deduce the total drag force F on each flagellum as well as the associated power P of the viscous forces on each flagellum . By programming the sinusoidal oscillations of the stage , we generate flows of desired amplitude U0 and frequency f0 and impose these flows along different directions θ to differentially load the two flagella , see Figure 1A . However , for flows with θ = 45° , the loads on the cis-flagellum ( red ) are ~2 times stronger than those on the trans ( blue ) ( Figure 1E , FFlowc≈2FFlowt ) , whereas flows with θ = 135° do the opposite ( Figure 1G ) . We use numerical simulations to quantify the differential loads exerted by flows along different angles θ = 45° , 90° , and 135° , on the cis- and the trans flagellum , see Figure 1A . Differential external loads are selectively exerted on the cis- and the trans-flagellum by imposing oscillatory background flows at an angle with respect to the cell 's symmetry axis . Then , we extract the mean pixel values over time within two sampling windows ( Figure 1C ) , and convert the two signals into observable-invariant flagellar phases ϕc , t , see Figure 1D . We do notice that flows along θ = 135° are able to entrain the flagella with PFlow < 0 , meaning that the flagella are working against the flows , and this shall be discussed in later sections . Our computations provide the loads on the flagella throughout the entire experiment , from the time the captured cell is gradually entrained by the external flow , see Appendix 1 : Hydrodynamic computation for asymmetric loading for the entire time series . Our computations demonstrate that flows along θ = 45° impose stronger loads on the cis flagellum , and we will refer to these as cis-flows , hereon forward . The variations of the loads are presented for one period of the power-recovery stroke , and have been obtained by phase averaging over N≈30 periods . While the cell is captured by a glass pipette fixed in the laboratory frame , the fluid moves with the flow chamber - which is fixed on an oscillating piezoelectric stage . Hereafter , we refer to the synchronization of the
[DISCUSSION] Exploiting the observation that the coordination between flagella can not be broken by external flows up to the strongest ones tested ( εmax∼10 Hz , Figure 2B ) , we quantify the lower limit of the total basal coupling , λct+λtc , to be approximately 40 Hz ( deduced in Appendix 1 : Monte-Carlo simulations ) , which is an order magnitude larger than the hydrodynamic inter-flagellar coupling . In contrast to the speculation that calcium is involved in the dynamic modulation of ciliary dominance in synchronous beating , our results indicate that the leading role of cis ( i. e. , λct≫λtc ) is an inherent property , which does not require active influx of external calcium , and possibly reflects an intrinsic mechanical asymmetry of the cellular mesh that anchors the two flagella into the cell body . Moreover , this point is further highlighted by an unexpected finding : when trans-flows are applied , the trans flagellum always beats against the external flow
[METHODS] The sum of inter-flagellar coupling λ=λct+λtc is set to be large enough , i. e. , λ=3|ft−fc| , to account for the fact that : ( 1 ) the coordinated beating is approximated in-phase , and ( 2 ) up until the strongest flow applied , the inter-flagellar synchronization can not be broken ( quantitative evaluation is detailed in Appendix 1 : Monte-Carlo",,899,93,None,"The cilia of a cell are made up of two specialized structures called flagella . These are called ciliar cells , and they are able to beat each other , which is important for the cell to maintain its shape . However , it is not clear how the ciliary cells work together to beat . To study this , researchers have been using a model organism called Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to study how a single flagellar cell beats . The model organism uses a technique called synchrony , where the two flagella are pushed together by a force called a flow of water . This causes the cis-flagellum to beat faster than the trans-flagellum , while the trans flagelum beats slower . During the beating , the flagella move in a coordinated fashion , allowing the cell’s movements to be controlled by the flow of air . It is also possible that the biflagella is a copy of the other flagella; however , there is no evidence that this is the case . Now , Wang et al . have used a mathematical approach to investigate how the two flying flagellas work together . They used the same technique to measure the force exerted on the slender-body flagella of the cell , but the results were different . In the experiments , they simulated a series of movements , with each flagella moving at a different speed . Each flagella was pushed by the same force , so the force on the trans flagellum was more powerful than the force that was on the"

[ABSTRACT] These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue , suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting . Here , we reported that intermittent fasting promoted interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) production by type 3 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC3s ) and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue . Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages . Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s . Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice . Deficiency of IL-22 receptor ( IL-22R ) attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting . Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue . Mechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown .
[INTRODUCTION] On the other hand , studies by Li et al. , 2017 , have indicated that alternate day fasting induces white adipose tissue beigeing by shaping the gut microbiota and elevating the fermentation products acetate and lactate . All intermittent fasting schemes including alternate day fasting , 5:2 intermittent fasting , and daily time-restricted feeding have shown the health benefits such as delaying aging , improving metabolism , and enhancing cognition . ILC3s-derived IL-22 can enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier function , reduce endotoxemia and inflammation , ameliorate insulin sensitivity , and improve the metabolic disorder of polycystic ovary syndrome . Studies by Kim et al. , 2017 , have shown that intermittent fasting induces white adipose beigeing via stimulation of angiogenesis and macrophage M2 polarization . Recent studies have indicated an alternative mechanism involving beigeing of white adipose tissue , which accounts for the major plasticity of energy expenditure . Although gut microbiota is closely related to immune response , it remains unclear whether intestinal immune cells contribute to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting . Our study demonstrates that intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis is actively involved in the regulation of adipose tissue beigeing . Obesity is defined as an epidemic metabolic disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation as the consequence of long-term energy surplus . Thus , therapeutic management of obesity has been focused on the restoration of energy balance , either by decreasing energy intake or by increasing energy expenditure . Therefore , the role of ILC3s in metabolic disease seems complex and the role of ILC3s in intermittent fasting and beigeing of adipose tissue is not known . Adipose-resident type 1 ILCs can promote adipose tissue fibrosis and obesity-associated insulin resistance while type 2 ILCs promote beiging of white adipose tissue and limit obesity . However , ILC3s are also reported to be involved in the induction of obesity , contributing to the metabolic disease . Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing of white adipose tissue induced by intermittent fasting . Based on developmental trajectories , ILCs are divided into five groups : natural killer cells , type 1 ILCs , type 2 ILCs , type 3 ILCs ( ILC3s ) , and lymphoid tissue-inducing cells . Here , we showed that alternate day fasting promoted the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s . Our findings thus reveal a novel pathway in the dialog between the gut and adipose tissue . Further
[RESULTS] To explore the mechanism by which intermittent fasting promotes the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s , live CD45+ lineage ( CD3 , CD5 , B220 , CD19 , Gr1 ) - cells isolated from the siLP of mice fed NCD , HFD , or HFD-IF were subjected for single-cell sequencing ( Figure 6-figure supplement 1A ) . In order to examine the role of promoting beigeing of white adipose tissue of IL-22 in the context of NCD and HFD mice , we intraperitoneally administrated IL-22 at the dose of 4µg/kg body weight/every other day for 6weeks into mice fed NCD or HFD . Furthermore , differentiated stromal vascular fraction ( SVF ) cells co-cultured with intestinal ILC3s in vitro ( Figure 2I ) demonstrated a significant
[DISCUSSION] Consistently , previous studies have shown that secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s changes between active and quiescent periods throughout the day which is regulated by the cycle patterns of food intake . IL-22 activates IL-22 receptor , which then regulates the expression of downstream inflammatory factors , tissue repair molecules , chemokines , antimicrobial peptides , and other molecules via Jak-1- and Tyk-2-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3 . In addition to directly promoting the beigeing of white adipose tissue through IL-22 , intestinal ILC3s may enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier , reducing serum LPS and peptidoglycan , thus reducing the inhibitory effect of LPS and peptidoglycan on the beigeing of white adipose tissue . Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s isolated from lean mice was sufficient to improve the metabolic dysfunctions in DIO mice , including increase of white adipose tissue beigeing and glucose tolerance . Second , a comprehensive set of in vivo and in vitro experiments shows that intermittent fasting promotes adipose tissue beigeing

It is caused by the accumulation of excess fat in the body , which can lead to obesity . In addition , it can cause a variety of health problems , including diabetes , heart disease , and cancer . However , the mechanisms by which obesity is caused are not well understood . For example , intermittent fasting has been shown to reduce the amount of fat that is stored in the bloodstream , reducing the risk of heart disease and obesity-related diseases such as diabetes . The immune system is also involved in regulating the production of a protein called interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) . This protein is found in the gut , but it is not clear how this protein is produced . To investigate this question , Wang et al . studied mice that had been fed a diet that included a low-fat diet . These mice were then fed an adipose-free diet , where they ate a lot of fat . They were then given a high-fat meal , followed by a short period of fasting . During this time , they were exposed to a chemical called aryl hydrocarbon . When the mice were fed the same diet for a week , their white adipocytes were beiged . Wang flies a mouse with a normal diet and eats a small amount of white fat every day . If the mice had eaten a large amount of food , this would help them to lose weight . But if the mice did not eat the same amount of foods , these mice would have been more likely to be beigered than normal mice . Therefore , we need to understand how the immune system regulates"

[ABSTRACT] To thoroughly investigate defensive ethograms , we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that paired footshock with a serial compound stimulus ( SCS ) consisting of distinct tone and white noise ( WN ) stimulus periods . To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses , we compared this paired SCS-footshock group with four control groups that were conditioned with either pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock , shock only , or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order , with paired or unpaired presentations . These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness , but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression . However , most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms focus only on freezing behavior , obscuring the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses . During extinction , the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group , and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting . Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity , proximity , and context of exposure , and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival . Comparatively , the unpaired and both reverse SCS groups expressed less tone-induced freezing and rarely showed jumping or darting during WN . On day 2 of conditioning , the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period . The unpaired , unpaired reverse , and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS , with minimal freezing and jumping . Interestingly , the paired reverse group did not jump to WN , and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction . Following the second day of conditioning , we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions .
[INTRODUCTION] Understanding the mechanisms underlying adaptive defensive behavior may grant insight into the pathophysiology of post-traumatic stress and panic disorders , wherein heightened responses to external stimuli are observed , yet neuroscientists need more tractable methods with which to investigate how the nervous system controls complex experience-dependent behavior . All groups went through two extinction sessions with SCS presentations alone to elucidate the extent to which prior associative pairing affects de-escalating response strategies , as well as to identify defensive behaviors that are expressed in the absence of a strict threat-signaling association . Others claim that the immediate transition from freezing to flight behavior is a result of the rapid change and relative increase in stimulus intensity from tone to WN that is caused by non-associative sensitization , or by inherent stimulus properties , akin to an acoustic startle response . To address this critical need , we developed a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that elicits both freezing and flight behaviors in response to conditioned stimuli , findings that have been replicated by others in both mice and rats . In standard Pavlovian conditioning paradigms , freezing is the dominant defensive behavior evoked by contexts and learned cues that are paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus ( US ) , like footshock . To test the importance of the SCS-shock contingency , we utilized an unpaired control procedure in which the US and the SCS were presented in a separated , pseudorandom , and non-predictive fashion . Defensive responses have evolved to maximize survival , and animals rapidly switch behaviors depending on threat imminence , the context of exposure , and previous experience with stimuli . It has been suggested that the inherent salience of the WN stimulus contributes more to WN-evoked flight response than its predictive association with the US . We compared these four control groups against a paired SCS-shock conditioning group to determine the effects of associative learning on SCS-evoked fear behavior . In addition , sensitization and stimulus salience are known to intensify freezing responses to auditory stimuli , and mice show increased reactivity to a WN stimulus after experiencing
[RESULTS] Altering the contingency between WN and shock in the unpaired or reversed SCS conditions profoundly reduced these defensive behaviors , but the increased activity in all groups during WN suggests that inherent properties of the WN interact with non-associative processes to induce locomotor responses . An activity index was calculated for each mouse as a combined measurement of cue-induced locomotion with escape jumping ( see Methods ) , and a two-way ANOVA was used to analyze tone- and WN-evoked activity indices ( Figure 2C and D ) . Overall , these data show that the respective changes in defensive behavior during tone and WN were significantly affected by the explicit
[DISCUSSION] Non-associative elements such as cue salience , change in stimulus intensity , and shock-induced sensitization elicit stress-associated behaviors like tail rattling and activity bursts , as hypothesized before , but the addition of the WN-threat associative pairing contributes significantly to eliciting high-intensity defensive responses like escape jumping . Given that the PA-R group did not display consistent jumping behavior to WN or tone , this suggests that a robust jumping response to WN in the SCS paradigm is not due to the non-associative salience of the WN as others have suggested but is instead due to its association with imminent threat . Overall , darting behaviors during conditioning contribute to the higher activity score observed during WN in the PA group , and our data suggests that these contributions are the result of associative learning and threat imminence , rather than non-associative stimulus
[METHODS] To generate this model , top-down footage ( 640×480 pixel resolution , 30 frames per second ) of 16 male and female C57BL/6 J mice that underwent SCS fear conditioning in Context B was collected and analyzed in DeepLabCut ( DLC ) to assign 8 tracking points ( Nose , L Ear , R",,1000,98,None,"When a person is exposed to a threat , the nervous system responds to the threat with a series of cues , such as footshock , which are combined with an aversive unconditioned stimulus , like white noise . This triggers the animal’s response to the averting threat . However , it is not clear how the animal responds in response to this cue , or how it responds when it encounters a threatening situation . In fact , many studies have shown that animals respond differently to different stimuli . For example , some animals respond to the sound of a loud noise by jumping and darting , while others respond to an unpleasant noise by throwing their tails . These behaviors are known as “defensive responses” , and it is unclear how these behaviors are regulated . To address this question , Wang et al . used a technique called Pavlovian conditioning to study mice that had been trained to respond to alternating sounds and a specific stimulus . The experiments showed that the mice responded to the same sound , but that they were more likely to respond quickly to the noise , rather than to freeze or jump . During the second day of the training , they jumped and rattled , whereas the mice stayed in the same position . Wang , Zhang ed . also found that the animals’ response to both sounds and white noise was more likely influenced by the presence of contrasting sounds . Thus , these findings suggest that the brain is able to adapt to different situations , even if it does not know exactly what the noise is ."

[ABSTRACT] Finally , we illustrate that in our theory , the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles . Furthermore , we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity , implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development . To address this question , we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits , all with different activity patterns . We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly , finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence . Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure . Among these activity patterns , we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient , but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons . However , it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage . To navigate their environment , insects need to keep track of their orientation .
[INTRODUCTION] Theoretical work has speculated that this recurring motif of sinusoidal activity patterns might be so prevalent because it enables easy elementwise vector addition , where vectors encoded as sinusoidal activity waveforms can be added together to give a sinusoidal waveform encoding the sum of the vectors . This finding led us to question whether the sinusoidal activation patterns seen in insect navigation circuits are a coincidence , or if they might offer a particular functional advantage that was selected for during evolution . Here , we show that enabling easy vector addition can not be the unique driving factor for the presence of sinusoidal heading encodings , as many other circuits with different activity patterns can perform vector addition in the same way . Finally , we combine ideas from replication dynamics with our theory , which leads us to the conclusion that the eight-column structure is a consequence of basic theoretical principles , rather than an evolutionary coincidence . Insects exhibit an impressive ability to navigate the world , travelling long distances to migrate , find food or reach places of interest before returning to their nests , a feat that requires them to keep track of their orientation across long journeys . This orientation tracking is achieved by the use of visual cues as well as integrating angular velocity signals over time to maintain a heading estimate relative to a starting angle , known as heading integration . We compare our predicted circuit with connectivity data for the desert locust ( Schistocerca gregaria ) and fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) using network analysis tools , showing a strong agreement . Further studies have shown that models closely aligned with biological data can indeed implement heading integration using sinusoidal activity patterns , and that such circuits can be learned . Electrophysiological and calcium imaging studies have shown that the neural population encoding the head direction in insects has a sinusoid-shaped activation pattern . We then ask how an insect brain might develop such a circuit , finding that a simple Hebbian learning rule is sufficient . Of all the circuits fulfilling these requirements , the sinusoidal activity pattern offers the best resilience to noise for the encoded information . This allows the encoded heading to be
[RESULTS] We thus analyse the effects of incorporating a modified Oja 's rule into our model , a classical variant of Hebbian learning where the synaptic strength between 2 neurons grows when both neurons are active simultaneously , and the total synaptic strength is regularised to prevent exploding weight growth , ( 19 ) dWn , mdt=ηdθdt ( am ( t ) an ( t ) −an2 ( t ) Wn , m ) , where Wn , m is the synaptic connection strength from neuron m to neuron n , am and an are the pre- and post-synaptic activities , respectively , and ηdθdt is an adaptive learning rate where the plasticity is proportional to the rotational speed
[DISCUSSION] This would be particularly relevant for foraging insects such as bees or ants , whose ability to remember their position with respect to their nest has been the subject of many experimental and computational studies . Insects often rely on a reference system that is globally anchored to a certain point or phenomenon , whether it is their nests for ants and bees , the sunlight polarisation pattern for locusts , or the milky way for dung beetles . We argue that even if these insects live in a 3D environment , the third dimension ( up-down ) is different from the other two due to gravity and the existence of a hard boundary ( the ground ) . Finally , another interesting avenue for future work is to compare the encoding of direction in insects with that of mammals , which encode heading in a fundamentally different way that uses many more

[ABSTRACT] Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin , both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control . Our results suggest that Cisd , probably iron-depleted Cisd , operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target . Complete loss of Cisd , in contrast , rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability , wing posture , dopamine levels , lifespan , and mitochondrial ultrastructure . We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients . Overexpressing Cisd , the Drosophila ortholog of CISD1 , and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan . Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain . CISD1 , a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein , is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination . The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge . This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies . In this conformation CISD1 can not coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor .
[INTRODUCTION] While most cases are sporadic , familial forms of PD are linked to mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in mitochondrial quality control like PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and Parkin ( PRKN ) , providing valuable insights into the pathophysiology of PD . Much of this mechanistic understanding has been elucidated in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster where Pink1 and Prkn loss of function results in profound changes of the mitochondrial ultrastructure causing mitochondrial dysfunction , impaired flight and climbing ability , and a shortened lifespan . In support of this hypothesis , it has been demonstrated that the oxidized 2Fe/2S cluster of CISD1 can be transferred to iron regulatory protein 1 ( IRP1 ) , a bifunctional protein that can switch between two distinct enzymatic activities based on the availability of iron . Overexpression of Cisd2 ( this publication used the alternative name Dosmit ) in fly muscles is detrimental and results in mitochondrial enlargement and the formation of double-membraned vesicles containing cytosolic proteins within mitochondria , implicating Cisd2 in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology . Based on the involvement of mammalian CISD1 in mitochondrial bioenergetics and quality control , iron metabolism and defense against oxidative distress - all hallmarks of PD - we aimed to investigate CISD1 's role in PD using both fly and mammalian model systems . In this state , known as the 'apo ' form , IRP1 functions as an RNA-binding protein and binds to specific RNA sequences called iron-responsive elements ( IREs ) located in the untranslated regions of target mRNAs . Cardiac myocytes from Cisd1 knockout ( KO ) mice exhibit a reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity , akin to KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) where this dysfunction is attributed to a reduction in the total cellular mitochondrial volume . Functionally , CISD1 exists as a homodimer , and each monomer of CISD1 harbors an 2Fe/2S ( 2 iron/2 sulfur ) cluster coordinated by three cysteines ( Cys72 , 74 , 83 ) and one histidine ( His87 ) . In our study , we identified CISD1 , particularly its iron-depleted apo form , as a downstream mediator of the PD pathology induced by the loss of Pink1 and Prkn function . It was thus proposed that the transfer of the iron-sulfur
[RESULTS] To investigate potential detrimental effects of apo-Cisd and whether these would be more pronounced in the absence of functional Pink1 , we next overexpressed either Cisd or a mutated Cisd C/S where we mutated all cysteine residues that coordinate the Fe/S cluster to serines ( C100S , C102S , and C/S ) in WT w1118 and Pink1B9 mutant flies using the mild ubiquitous Gal4 driver daughterless ( da ) . To investigate this , we conducted our dimerization assay in cells subjected to a 2 hr treatment with the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone ( FCCP ) , a combination of the complex V inhibitor oligomycin and the complex III inhibitor antimycin A ( A/O ) , or the iron
[DISCUSSION] In line with a toxic function of Cisd and apo-Cisd , removing fly Cisd by KO of the coding sequence completely protected flies against Pink1 depletion-induced changes in climbing ability , abnormal wing posture , dopamine levels , and lifespan but ameliorated only the climbing ability and wing posture in Prkn mutant flies . However , CISD1 C83S , a genetically engineered CISD1 incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster and probably also incapable of forming a disulfide bond , has a higher propensity for dimer formation when analyzed in a cellular assay based on complementation of split luciferase ( Figure 2A ) . While our study suggests a role in redox imbalance and iron dysregulation , particularly implicating the iron-depleted form of CISD1 , Ham et al. , 2023 , describe its impact on ER calcium release , and Martinez et al. , 2024 , propose interference with autophagy/mitophagy .

These proteins are known as iron-responsive elements , and they are found in many different types of cells , including the brain , spinal cord and spinal cord . In PD patients , the iron-sensitive elements can be found in the mitochondria , which are made up of two proteins called CISD1 and IRP1 . The resulting protein is known as a dimer , but it is not known how this dimer is formed . It is thought that the dimer forms when a protein called Cisd1 binds to a group of proteins called iron-sulfur binders . However , it was not clear whether CisD1 is involved in this process . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a fruit fly called Drosophila melanogaster to study the role of Cisde1 in PD and found that it forms dimers in flies that have been affected by a mutation in a gene called PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and Parkin , both of which are essential for maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial structure . Using this model organism , Zhang , Chen ed . found that Cisdes , a member of the family of iron-regulatory proteins , also forms dimer structures in fungi . This suggests that a genetic mutation in Cisdie , or a mutant version of CISDE , could be a potential therapeutic target for PD in humans ."

[ABSTRACT] This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes , but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions . Critically , the host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase ( SVP ) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males , with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP . Here , we made the surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype , suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54 . Importantly , we clarify how SAP54 , by targeting SVP , heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males , thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects . The molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes - where genetic information of one organism is manifested as traits in another - remain largely unclear . Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle . SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular 'matchmaker ' , helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves . This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54 , produced by parasitic phytoplasmas , in attracting leafhopper vectors . This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed svp null mutant plants over those not exposed to males . However , we previously demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves and the leaf-like flowers were not required . We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males . SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants . Obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts . In contrast , this phytoplasma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization .
[INTRODUCTION] The effector protein secreted AY-WB protein ( SAP ) 11 binds to and destabilizes class II TCP transcription factors - this action leads to changes in leaf shapes and stem proliferation , reminiscent of witches ' brooms , and altered root architecture resembling the hairy roots found in infected plants . Nonetheless , factors like suppressor of overexpression of CO 1 ( SOC1 ) and short vegetative phase ( SVP ) are also expressed in leaves and other organs during the A. thaliana vegetative developmental phase , and regulate processes other than orchestrating the flowering process , such as plant defence responses , as has been shown for SOC1 . This concept is especially evident in obligate parasites that depend on alternate hosts for transmission , as they often do not only alter the conditions of their immediate hosts but also have far-reaching effects on other organisms in the ecosystem . Leafhoppers prefer plants that stably produce SAP54 for reproduction and this preference phenotype requires the presence of RAD23 , which is essential for both breaking down MADS-box transcription factors and inducing leaf-like flowers . These effectors target and disrupt MADS-box transcription factors , akin to animal HOX genes , leading to a transformation of flowers into leaf-like structures , alterations that mirror the phyllody and virescence symptoms of phytoplasma infection . For instance , the protozoan parasite Taxoplasma gondii changes the behavior of their intermediate rodent hosts by reducing their innate fear for cats , which are the definite hosts where the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction to produce oocysts . The responsible phytoplasma genes encode for effector molecules that , once inside the plant cell cytoplasm , target and typically disrupt or degrade essential plant transcription factors involved in growth , development , and defence . Although advancements have been made in identifying parasite virulence factors , our understanding of the specific host processes that are commandeered to produce these extended phenotypes is still developing . As obligate bacterial parasites , phytoplasmas frequently trigger the emergence of unusual plant structures such as leaf-like floral parts (
[RESULTS] Interestingly , female leafhoppers were equally likely captured on GFP and SAP54 plants when both of these plants were placed in an odour and sound permeable black container , equipped with either transparent or green sticky traps ( Figure 1-figure supplement 3A choice tests 1 and 2 ) , suggesting that volatile or acoustic cues emitted from male-exposed GFP or SAP54 plants do not bias female landing choice at a distance when identical visual cues are present . Among the biotic stress response genes , those that are significantly enriched and display the greatest fold-change among male-specific DEGs in leaves of SAP54 plants encode cell surface receptors of
[DISCUSSION] However , emerging research has begun to shed light on the roles of SVP outside of flowering : for instance , it acts as a positive regulator of age-related resistance against bacterial pathogens in Arabidopsis thaliana and serves as a negative regulator of various Jasmonate Zim-domain ( JAZ ) genes during the vegetative growth phase . However , given that the removal of males from SAP54 leaves prior to female choice does not enhance female colonization ( comparison of Figure 1 treatment 4 with treatment 5 ) , we can not exclude that male produced volatiles or mating calls can enhance or supplement SAP54-dependent changes in biotic stress responses to males for enhanced female attraction . The observation that female leafhoppers prefer to reproduce on both SAP54 and svp mutant plants exclusively in the presence of leafhopper males underscores a
[METHODS] cDNA library construction for SAP54 and GFP was performed according to the IlluminaTruSeq protocol , followed by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and pooling four randomized libraries per lane , with 50 bp single-end reads and 25 M read coverage per sample , whereas svp null mutant and wild-type libraries were prepared with",,1009,99,None,"Insects , such as the protozoan parasite Taxoplasma gondii , can infect plants and animals . The parasites can also infect other animals , including humans , animals and plants . However , it is not clear how the parasite can cause these changes in their hosts . For example , the parasitic phytoplasmas can cause the leaves of plants to turn green , which can lead to the development of leaf-like flowers . This process is called the ‘matchmaker’ , and it is important to understand how this process is carried out . In the plant , a protein called SAP54 is produced by a parasite called A . thaliana . SAP54 binds to and disrupts the transcription factor short vegetative phase ( SVP ) in the leaves , making it more vulnerable to the male leafhoppers . It is thought that SAP54 helps the female leafhopper to find a mate by degrading the SVP-containing complexes in leaves exposed to males and thereby allowing them to colonise the plant with the males themselves . Now , Liu et al . have discovered that the effector SAP54 acts as a matchmaker , helping the females to locate a partner . These results suggest that SAP 54 is a key factor in the attraction of female leaf-hoppers to plants exposed to females and that it is also involved in promoting the growth of the leaf . Further experiments revealed that SAP55 is required for the attraction phenotype to occur , suggesting that the role of SAP54 in this process may be more complex than previously thought . Furthermore , this study provides new insights into how SAP54 affects the behaviour of the plant and how it influences the behavior of other organisms"

[ABSTRACT] At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure ( a time when tolerance is measurable ) , surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations : one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins , rRNA processing machinery , and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity , termed the Ribo-dominant ( Rd ) state ; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes , termed the Stress-dominant ( Sd ) state . To better characterize this cytoprotective tolerance program at the molecular single-cell level , we used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish their subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs . Current antifungal treatments fail , at least in part , because C. albicans can initiate a strong drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration . We provide evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response ( RASTR ) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival . Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage with distinct metabolic and stress responses . Candida albicans , an opportunistic human pathogen , poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with significant socio-economic burden . This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment .
[INTRODUCTION] The work also identifies interesting variability in the temporal response to acute drug exposure but does not address molecular heterogeneity in the subsequent emergence from cell cycle arrest that can only be observed as tolerance after longer times ( days 2-3 ) , the focus of this study . For a tolerant fungal isolate , a proportion of cells ( typically 5-95 % of the population ) can grow , albeit slowly , at concentrations surpassing the population average MIC ; tolerance is detectable only 48 hr after drug exposure , which is longer than most clinical assays are performed . Approaches for predicting patient response to an infection , based solely on the average response of cells to a drug challenge across a population after 24 hr , can overlook such subpopulations with behaviors that have the potential to significantly impact the evolution of drug resistance . While single-cell ( sc ) transcriptomic assays have been applied extensively to mammalian systems , their use in fungal contexts remains limited due to the challenges of disrupting the rigid cell wall , lysing the membrane , and the small overall amount of RNA per cell . Most previous studies of drug tolerance , ranging from classic growth assays to omics profiling , have treated surviving fungal subpopulations as a homogenous whole , mainly due to a lack of technology to efficiently study large numbers of individual fungal cells . Resistance usually results from mutations that directly influence interaction of the drug with its target , while tolerance is thought to stem from phenotypic heterogeneity or cell-to-cell variations in phenotypic responses within an isogenic cell population . We detect a heterogeneous response to FCZ within isogenic populations , supporting the idea that different cells exhibit distinct survival strategies , including some with increased expression of genes related to drug tolerance . A resistant fungal isolate can thrive in the presence of an antifungal drug at concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of that species , with detectable growth within 24 hr of drug exposure . In our preliminary pre-printed study , we profiled C. albicans using a fungal nanoliter droplet-based assay ( DROP-seq ) , modified from the original system presented by Macosko et al. , 2015 . We profiled the
[RESULTS] To further investigate the hypothesis that UT cells differentially express genes involved in specific stress responses , we chose gene pairs predicted to have mutually exclusive expression in any given cell based on the sc transcriptomics profiles ; for example , heat-shock protein 70 ( HSP70 ) and dithiol glutaredoxin ( TTR1 ) , which is involved in the oxidative stress response ( Figure 2C ; McNemar test , p-value < 0 . The analysis first uses a deep generative neural network ( scVI ) to transform the high-dimensional expression profiles down to lower dimensions , followed by Leiden clustering to identify groups of cells that have similar expression profiles ( Materials and methods , 'Quality control , basic
[DISCUSSION] Here , by examining cellular trajectories across populations in a high-throughput manner , we obtained new insights into time-sensitive processes , such as the emergence of drug tolerance during 2-3 days of drug exposure and the existence of cells with Rd and Sd states , which reflect two different cellular states within the RASTR response described as a molecular signature of an S. cerevisiae stress response . Specifically , this study refines published bulk transcriptome studies by differentiating between genes , pathways , and responses that are expressed universally in all cells , and those that are restricted to specific subpopulations . The use of a nanoliter droplet-based assay adapted for fungal cells enabled a detailed sc analysis of C. albicans in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs over a period of days . If the Rd response proves generalizable to other drug treatments , disrupting the Rd to Sd tolerance transition or
[METHODS] To investigate the key sources of variability across cell subpopulations , we curated 43 gene signatures related to microbial phenotypic diversity and drug tolerance including the cell cycle , TCA cycle , specific and general stress responses , metabolic pathways , amino acid biosynthesis , efflux pumps , and specific drug responses among others .

In this study , researchers used a technique called DROP-seq to study thousands of fungal cell types .

These genes were found to be involved in a number of different aspects of the cell’s survival . For example , some of the genes involved in stress responses were activated in the cells , while others were not . Some of these genes were also involved in other processes , like cellular respiration , that are important for the cell to survive . Another gene , called RASTR , was also activated , suggesting that the cells may be more sensitive to the drugs they are exposed to . Further experiments showed that a group of cells that had been treated with the drug had a different response to the antifungal drug , with some cells growing at higher concentrations than others . Other cells that were treated with another drug tended to grow at higher levels , although some of them were more resistant to the antibiotic ."

[ABSTRACT] In an idealized model , the census population size determines both this minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged , and the amount of neutral diversity . We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations , as well as the Effective Number of Codons , to show that the protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder . Empirically , an 'effective population size ' is often estimated from the amount of putatively neutral genetic diversity and is assumed to also capture a species ' effectiveness of selection . However , past metrics that compare codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in % GC content and/or amino acid composition . Here , we propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ) , based on Kullback-Leibler divergence , that corrects for both confounders . A potentially more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons . The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits variation among species in the effectiveness of selection .
[INTRODUCTION] However , the property of most relevance to nearly neutral theory is instead the inflection point s at which non-preferred alleles become common enough to matter ( Figure 1 ) , and hence the degree to which highly exquisite adaptation can be maintained in the face of ongoing mutation and genetic drift . Our purpose is to find an accessible metric that can quantify the limits to weak selection important to nearly neutral theory ; this differs from past evaluations focused on comparing different genes of the same species and recapitulating 'ground truth ' simulations thereof . In an idealized population of constant population size and no selection at linked sites , a mutation-selection-drift model describes how this ratio of fixation probabilities depends on the census population size N , and hence gives the fraction of sites expected to be found in preferred vs. non-preferred states ( Figure 1 ) . Specifically , species that make more use of an amino acid for which there is stronger selection among codons would have higher codon bias , even if each amino acid considered on its own had identical codon bias irrespective of which species it is in . Here , we extend the CAI , using the information-theory-based Kullback-Leibler divergence , so that it corrects for both GC and amino acid composition ( see Methods ) to create a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ) . Here , we control for % GC , capturing species differences both in mutation and in gene conversion , by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the observed codon frequencies away from the codon frequencies that we would expect to see given the genomic % GC content of the species . While genetic diversity has been found to reflect some aspects of life history strategy , there remain concerns about whether neutral genetic diversity and the limits to weak selection always remain closely coupled in non-equilibrium settings . While this works well for comparing genes within the same species , it unfortunately means that the species-wide strength of codon bias appears in the normalizing denominator ( see Equation 4 and Figure 3-figure supplement 1A ) . In the absence of a clear species definition , polymorphism is sometimes calculated across too broad a range of genomes , substantially inflating Ne ; a poor sampling scheme can have
[RESULTS] To test this , we analyze two subsets of our data : those that emerged prior to the last eukaryotic common ancestor ( LECA ) , here referred to as 'old ' protein domains , and 'young ' protein domains that emerged after the divergence of animals and fungi from plants . Many vertebrates have higher recombination rates and hence GC-biased gene conversion near genes ; in this case genome-wide GC content would misestimate the codon usage expected from the combination of mutation bias and GC-biased gene conversion in the vicinity of genes . Instead , they might be driven by the recent birth of ISD-rich proteins in animals , and/or by differences among sequences in their subsequent tendency to proliferate into many
[DISCUSSION] However , we have not ruled out a role for selection for higher % GC in ways that are general rather than restricted to coding regions , whether in shaping mutational biases or the extent of gene conversion , or even at the single-nucleotide level in a manner shared between coding regions and intergenic regions . A direct effect of ISD on fitness agrees with studies of random Open Reading Frames ( ORFs ) in Escherichia coli , where fitness was driven more by amino acid composition than % GC content , after controlling for the intrinsic correlation between the two . Note that if a species were to experience a sudden reduction in census population size , for example due to habitat loss , leading to less effective selection , it would take some multiple of the neutral coalescent time for CAIS to fully adjust . Both CAIS and ENC can also be estimated for far more species
[METHODS] Past measures of ENC do not contain stop or start codons , but as we did for CAI and CAIS above , we include stop codons as an 'amino acid ' and therefore amend Equation 14 to ( 15 ) ENC=2+9F′^2+2F′^3+5F′^4+3F′^6 . Of the 170 vertebrates meeting the quality criteria of James et al. , 2021 , 118 had annotated intergenic",,954,96,None,"The genetic diversity of a species depends on how many genes are present in the genome . This is known as the “effective population size” , and it is often assumed that the population size determines the amount of neutral genetic diversity . However , recent studies have shown that the effective population size is not always the same across species . For example , some species have more than one gene in their genome , while others have less than one . In contrast , others have fewer genes , which means that they have more mutations than others . One way to measure the effectiveness of selection is to compare the number of genes in a population . To do this , we use a method called the Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ) . The CAIS measures how many different genes are found in the population , but it does not measure how many of the genes are in the same species , or how many are in different species compared to each other . Instead , it measures how much diversity there is in the populations of different organisms . CAIS is based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence , a theory that describes how the population sizes of different species are influenced by the number and quality of genetic diversity in the species surveyed . It also measures how well a particular gene is adapted to its environment , such as when it is mutated or when it becomes common with other genes . As a result , the CAIS can be used to measure how much genetic diversity exists in the organisms studied . Now , Wang et al . have developed a new CAIS that can measure the extent to which genetic diversity can be maintained in the presence of mutations , mutations and other changes . By comparing the results of CAIS with those of other species"

[ABSTRACT] In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis , local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed E. coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released . An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) that is released by inflamed host cells and tissues , and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner . ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils , potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity . Using genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) , we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane . In addition , impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane notably contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death . Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses , resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival . Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation . Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO . This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis . In addition , bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ) . Here , we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP .
[INTRODUCTION] In colonized compartments such as the intestine , it has been shown that ATP released by mutualistic bacteria modulates local cellular and secretory immune responses and in the mouth , bacterial ATP release leads to biofilm dispersal and periodontitis . In particular , we have described that the connexin-dependent release of ATP by macrophages initiates an autocrine loop of over-activation , resulting in altered local and systemic cytokine secretion , which exacerbates abdominal sepsis . It has been shown that adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , as soon as it is released into the extracellular space , critically modulates inflammatory and immune responses by activating ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y receptors . However , the role of ATP released by bacteria invading non-colonized compartments , such as the abdominal cavity or the blood in the context of local and systemic infections , remains to be determined . ATP release has been shown for a variety of bacteria including the sepsis-associated Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Klebsiella pneumoniae ( K. pneumoniae ) from the Proteobacteria phylum or Enterococcus faecalis ( E. faecalis ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) from the Firmicutes phylum . The mechanisms by which inflammatory and immune responses in the host are modulated by such released bacterial ATP have just begun to be elucidated . Until recently however , most trials inhibiting cytokine responses or Toll-like receptors failed , indicating that alternative approaches for immunomodulation are required . Second , we analyzed the function of the inner bacterial membrane on ATP release over time in E. coli and in E. coli with mutations in integral respiratory chain proteins . Lastly , based on the finding that bacteria secrete outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ) , we investigated systemic consequences of released bacterial ATP . Immune-modulating strategies are an additional approach to antibiotics to curb excessive inflammation and to support an effective defense against the infectious agents . Given its high incidence and immense socio-economic burden , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has declared sepsis as a global health priority . Antibiotic treatment remains the main approach to treat sepsis ; however , despite the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics , lethality remains high . Sepsis is
[RESULTS] In the lysosomal pathway , transcripts for proteins involved in autophagosome-lysosome fusion ( Gabarap ) , endosome to lysosome transport ( Hgsnat , Laptm5 ) , or enzymatic cleavage ( Capn1 , Fuca1 , Ctsb , Ctsd , Gba ) were significantly higher expressed in response to ATP-loaded OMV when compared to empty OMV ( Figure 6F and G ) . Therefore , ATP release of the E. coli parental strain ( PS ) was compared to all available mutants of ATP synthase subunits ( ΔatpA , ΔatpB , ΔatpC , ΔatpD , ΔatpE , ΔatpF , ΔatpH ) and cytochrome bo3 oxidase subunits ( ΔcyoA , ΔcyoB , ΔcyoC , ΔcyoD ) from the Keio
[DISCUSSION] As we focused on the laboratory BW25113 E. coli strain , it remains to be elucidated if impaired outer membrane integrity and bacterial death are also of such importance in other gramneg or also grampos bacteria . These findings have the potential to lead to the development of novel treatments for abdominal sepsis , e. g. , by in vitro generated OMV that modulate neutrophil function via delivery of inhibitors to intracellular purinergic receptors during sepsis . Despite low rates of bacterial death during exponential growth , and a low ratio of dead to live bacteria , the high gradient between intra- and extracellular ATP might be sufficient to explain the amount of released ATP measured . Activation of neutrophils in response to ATP-loaded OMV resulted in upregulation of inflammatory , lysosomal , and neutrophil degranulation pathways as well as an upregulation of the apoptosis pathway and genes involved in NETosis
[METHODS] After washing , a MidiMACS separator ( Miltenyi Biotec , cat # 130-042-302 ) together with an LS column ( Miltenyi Biotec , cat # 130-042-401 ) was used to isolate neutrophils and purity of positively selected neutrophils as well as unlabeled cells was assessed by flow cytometry ( Key resources table : Ly-6C PE-Cy7 , CD11b",,980,97,None,"The bacteria that cause sepsis are known as bacteria , and they can cause a variety of diseases , including cancer , heart disease , diabetes and cancer . Infections with bacteria can lead to severe symptoms , such as abdominal pain , fever , rash , diarrhea , vomiting and diarrhea . However , it is not clear how bacteria release a substance called extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , which is released into the bloodstream . This is a chemical that is released by bacteria in the body , but it is unclear how it is released . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used genetically modified Escherichia coli strains to study the release of ATP from bacteria . The experiments show that ATP is released from the inside of the bacteria’s outer membrane , where it is produced by a enzyme called ATP synthase . It is also found in the outer membrane of bacteria that contains a protein called apyrasin . When the bacteria were grown in a laboratory , the bacteria released ATP into the inner membrane . These ATP-releasing cells were then able to produce a new protein called OMV . Using a mouse model of abdominal sepses , Zhang , Chen ed . found that bacterial ATP release is dependent on a bacterial protein called an ATP enzyme . A protein called P2X and metabotropic P2Y receptors are involved in releasing ATP and causing inflammation in the host . Furthermore , these receptors help to activate the immune system , making it more likely that the bacteria will die . Zhang e"

[ABSTRACT] Linear mixed model and a novel structural equation modeling ( SEM ) method that allows estimation of both components and factors were used to estimate the joint effects of cognitive phenotypes polygenic scores ( PGSs ) , familial and neighborhood socioeconomic status ( SES ) , and supportive environment on NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence and PLEs . Using large-scale longitudinal data , we tested the relationships of genetic and environmental factors ( such as familial and neighborhood environment ) with cognitive intelligence and their relationships with current and future PLEs in children . Our findings have policy implications in that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children . Specifically , cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs , with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs . Maladaptive cognitive functioning , influenced by genetic and environmental factors , is hypothesized to mediate the relationship between these factors and childhood PLEs . In children , psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ) are related to risk of psychosis , schizophrenia , and other mental disorders . We leveraged large-scale multimodal data of 6 , 602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study . Our findings indicate that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs are significantly associated with lower PGSs for cognitive phenotypes , lower familial SES , lower neighborhood SES , and less supportive environments . We adjusted for ethnicity ( genetically defined ) , schizophrenia PGS , and additionally unobserved confounders ( using computational confound modeling ) . This study underscores the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through their effects on cognitive intelligence .
[INTRODUCTION] Furthermore , the PGS for EA is associated with a wide range of biological and social outcomes , including brain morphometry , psychopathologies such as PLEs , autism , depression , Alzheimer 's disease , neuroticism , cognitive decline , body mass index ( BMI ) , time spent watching television , geographic residence , and wealth inequality . Recent advances in genetics have led to the development of the polygenic score ( PGS ) approach : a computational method to estimate the genetic loading for a complex trait using statistical associations of each single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) identified by genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) . Our investigation traces these effects from the baseline and through the 1- and 2-year follow-ups , providing a nuanced understanding on the role of cognitive phenotype PGSs , family SES , neighborhood SES , and positive family and school environments in shaping PLEs in children aged 9-10 years . PLEs also point toward the potential for other psychopathologies including mood , anxiety , and substance disorders , are linked to deficits in cognitive intelligence and show a stronger association with environmental risk factors during childhood than other internalizing/externalizing symptoms . Adverse neighborhood environment , such as the percent of families below poverty line , low education levels , and exposure to violence , is associated with lower cognitive performance ( CP ) and a greater risk for psychosis in children . An important gap in the literature is the lack of integrated assessment of the effects of genetic and environmental factors at multiple levels ( e. g. , familial vs neighborhood ) to dissect the genetic and environmental effects underlying abnormal cognitive intelligence and the PLEs . Abnormal neurodevelopment , influenced by genetic factors , combined with disrupted cognitive processes resulting from socioenvironmental adversity , may eventually give rise to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia , relevant to PLEs . As the two most frequently used proxies of cognitive intelligence in genetic studies , PGSs for CP and EA are positively correlated with intelligence , EA , income , self-rated health , and height . Conversely , as protective factors against familial and neighborhood
[RESULTS] Our linear mixed model and IGSCA analyses were adjusted using sex , age , marital status , BMI , family history of psychiatric disorders , and ABCD research sites as covariates . Positive school environment was associated positively with total intelligence and fluid intelligence and negatively with all three measures of baseline year PLEs , 1-year follow-up PLEs , and 2-year follow-up PLEs ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Children of European ancestry showed significantly different marital status , lower BMI , and family history of psychiatric disorders compared to children of other genetic ancestries . For all observed years , positive environment had largest total effects on PLEs , followed by family
[DISCUSSION] Genetic variants associated with CP and EA are related to complex traits across the life span , including neuroticism , depressive symptoms , smoking in adulthood , cognitive decline at a later age , risk for Alzheimer 's disease , brain volume , area , and thickness , as well as psychotic disorders . While policy implications in observational studies like ours might be limited , our findings show the importance of comprehensive approaches considering the entire ecosystem of children 's lives-including residential , family , and school environment-for future research aimed to enhance children 's intelligence and mental health . Although the ABCD Study aimed to achieve its representativeness by recruiting from an array of school systems located around each of the 21 research sites , chosen for their diversity in geography , demographics , and SES , it is not fully representative of the
[METHODS] We used the multimodal genetic and environmental data of 11 , 878 preadolescent children aged 9-10 years old collected from 21 research sites of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development ( ABCD ) Study , one of the largest longitudinal studies for children 's neurodevelopment in the United States . Considering that the observed variables of the",,990,98,None,"In children , psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ) are linked to risk of psychosis , schizophrenia , and other mental disorders . These experiences are also linked to depression , Alzheimer’s disease , neuroticism , anxiety , depression and substance abuse . The genetic and environmental factors that influence these phenotypes are thought to play a role in the development of these psychiatric disorders in children . However , it is not clear how these factors affect the development and development of PLE symptoms in children and how they affect their mental health . To investigate this question , Weidman et al . used large-scale data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study ( ABCD ) to study the effects of genetic and environment factors on PLE in children aged 9–10 years . This included a combination of statistical methods , such as structural equation modeling , to estimate the effects on cognitive intelligence , family socioeconomic status ( SES ) and supportive environment ( SEM ) . Weiderman & Cox compared the results of 6 , 602 children from the ABCD study to find that lower cognitive intelligence was associated with lower PGSs for cognitive , lower familial and neighborhood socioeconomic levels , higher neighborhood SES and less supportive environment . Moreover , we found that supportive parenting and positive school environments showed the strongest impact on reducing PLE . Our findings suggest that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children by improving school or family environments . Overall , our findings highlight the importance of improving the education and social environment for children and improve the quality of life ."

Within telencephalic regions , FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons , thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity . We used hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro platform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation . We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity , leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids . The roles of FGF signaling and its effector genes remain poorly characterized in human experimental models mimicking early fetal telencephalic development . The morphogen FGF8 establishes graded positional cues imparting regional cellular responses via modulation of early target genes . Moreover , FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders .
[INTRODUCTION] FGFs exert their functions by binding to four highly conserved FGF receptors ; among those , FGFR3 plays a specific role in regulating brain size by influencing progenitor proliferation and apoptosis and is essential for the correct formation and regionalization of the occipitotemporal cortex . By building upon previous methods , we optimized a hybrid 2D/3D in vitro culture system that facilitates the efficient formation of telencephalic FOXG1+ tissue and allows for the assessment of FGF8-mediated effects on neural cell differentiation and identity acquisition . Collectively , our data redefine the role of FGF8 as a crucial morphogen for regional patterning and the establishment of distinct D/V and A/P telencephalic identities in human cells , thus highlighting its significance in modulating the expression of key developmental and NDD-related genes during the organization of the human brain . Previous studies utilizing 2D neural protocols , followed by adaptations for 3D organoid protocols , demonstrated that pluripotent cells adopt a dorsal/anterior ( i. e. telencephalic ) neural fate when shielded from posteriorizing factors such as TGFβ , BMPs , retinoic acid , and WNTs . Given their multiple roles during embryonic and adult age , it is not surprising that FGF factors have been implicated in the onset of several NDDs , and adult psychiatric conditions , such as anxiety , depression , and schizophrenia . The anterior FGF8 telencephalic gradient negatively regulates Nr2f1 during early mouse development , allowing its expression to follow an anterior-low to posterior-high gradient , which is crucial for specifying areal identities in the dorsal telencephalon . During the development of telencephalic vesicles , FGF8 diffuses from the anterior neural ridge , located at the most anterior pole , creating a gradient that regulates proliferation , apoptosis , regionalization , and identity acquisition along cortical axes . FGF8 efficiently modulates NR2F1 and other genes associated with brain disorders in human FOXG1+ telencephalic cells , underscoring its critical role in the fine-tuning of key neurodevelopmental and pathogenic pathways . These morphogens instruct neural progenitors with spatial and temporal 'coordinates ' along the dorsoventral ( D/V ) and anteroposterior ( A/P ) brain axes , modulating early expression gradients of key developmental genes in a dose-dependent manner . During early development , FGF8 is essential in establishing the midbrain-hindbrain boundary - a region known as the isthmus , which acts as a brain organizer - where the FGF8 diffusing gradient controls
[RESULTS] While widespread FOXG1 expression supported the general telencephalic identity of both WNTi and WNTi + FGF8 treated organoids ( Figure 3-figure supplement 2A and B ) , qRT-PCR showed a partial reduction of the anterior marker SIX3 , induction of OTX2 a telencephalic marker at early stages before becoming restricted to more posterior regions at later stages , and induction of the mesencephalic marker EN2 in WNTi + FGF8 organoids ( Figure 3-figure supplement 2C ) , suggesting that long-term FGF8 treatment might induce the formation of regions other than the forebrain . Interestingly , ventral medial ganglionic eminence ( MGE ) transcripts ( SHH , LHX8 , and NKX2-1 ) were not induced in WNTi + FGF8 organoids , whereas lateral ganglionic eminence (
[DISCUSSION] It is important to note that the use of a ROCK inhibitor was necessary during early NP dissociation , as significant cell death occurred within 24 hr in its absence , indicating that early human progenitor cells are susceptible to apoptosis when cell contacts are lost , similar to undifferentiated hiPSCs . In this study , we demonstrate that the addition of patterning cues ( FGF8 in this case ) to the culture medium - even when applied in a non-polarized manner - is sufficient to instruct the development of additional regional fates that co-exist and co-develop within the same organoid while maintaining spatial segregation . While dual SMAD inhibition in 2D allows rapid neural induction in just 7 days , subsequent steps in 3D culture promote the formation of reproducible brain-like cellular architectures , including rosettes and neural epithelia , which gradually mature into neurons organized in a cortical plate-like structure . In mice , reduced Fgf8 levels cause progressive telencephalic
[METHODS] After a pre-incubation with LTSM medium ( minimum 2 hr , maximum O/N at 37 °C ; pre-conditioning medium was prepared as detailed in Neural differentiation into telencephalic organoids and supplemented with additional 5 µl Matrigel per 1 ml of medium ) to pre-condition the chip surface , organoids were transferred on MEA chips ( n=3/5 organoids per chip ) and let",,940,95,None,"The brain is made up of a series of cells called neurons . Each cell has a specific type of cell called a telencephalon , which is shaped like a circle . The telencyphalon is made of specialized cells called vesicles . These veses are made of proteins called FGFs , and they help to shape the brain . However , it is not clear how these proteins work . For example , the FGF8 protein is thought to be involved in regulating the growth and development of neurons in the uterus . In humans , this protein is known as FGF1 . This protein is found in the brains of mice , but it has not been shown to affect the development of the brain in humans . Now , Wang et al . have used a technique called in vitro culture to study the effects of FGF18 on the formation of human telentencephalic cells . To do this , they used X-ray crystallography to create a model of the human brain , where the cells were grown in a laboratory . They found that the cells in the model brain had a different shape than the ones in the normal brains . Furthermore , when the cells grown in the laboratory were treated with a drug called retinoic acid , these cells were more likely to develop in the same way as the normal cells , resulting in fewer cells forming in the adult brain compared to the normal ones .

[ABSTRACT] We find that in the 2nd instar larval period ( L2 ) , sleep and feeding are spread across the day ; these behaviors become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage ( L3 ) . In Drosophila , circadian sleep patterns are initiated with formation of a circuit connecting the central clock to arousal output neurons ; emergence of circadian sleep also enables long-term memory ( LTM ) . Finally , we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms . Together , our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors . Forcing mature ( L3 ) animals to adopt immature ( L2 ) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit LTM . In addition , the development of the clock ( DN1a ) -arousal ( Dh44 ) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment . Here , we identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosophila larvae . However , the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown . As diurnal animals mature , feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night . Sleep and feeding patterns lack strong daily rhythms during early life .
[INTRODUCTION] These changes in nutritional storage capacity are likely conserved as mammalian body composition and nutritional capacity change over infant development and Drosophila show rapid increases in overall larval body size including the size of the fat body ( used for nutrient storage ) across development . Additionally , we demonstrate that DN1a-Dh44 circuit formation is developmentally plastic , as rearing on an insufficient nutritional environment prevents establishment of this neural connection . While endogenous deeper sleep in L3 facilitates LTM , we find that experimentally inducing deep sleep prematurely in L2 is detrimental to development and does not improve LTM performance . Finally , we find that Dh44 neurons require glucose metabolic genes to promote sleep-wake rhythm development , suggesting that these neurons sense the nutritional environment to promote circadian-sleep crosstalk . Development of this circuit promotes deeper sleep in L3 resulting in the emergence of long-term memory ( LTM ) capabilities at the L3 stage but not before . We demonstrate that developmental changes to energetic demands drive consolidation of periods of sleep and feeding across the day as animals mature . In adult Drosophila , sleep and feeding behaviors are consolidated to specific times of day with flies eating more in the day than the night . As development proceeds , nutritional intake and storage capacity increase , allowing for the consolidation of feeding and sleep to specific times of day . We previously determined that sleep-wake rhythms are initiated in early 3rd instar Drosophila larvae ( L3 ) ( 72 hr AEL ) . Here , we identify the cues that trigger the emergence of the DN1a-Dh44 circuit and the consolidation of sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae . Although mechanisms encoding the molecular clock are well understood , little is known about how rhythmic behaviors first emerge . However , the role that developmental change in metabolic drive plays in regulating the consolidation of behavioral rhythms is not known . Likewise , in humans , disruptions in sleep and rhythms during development are a common co-morbidity in neurodevelopmental disorders including ADHD and autism . A key potential factor in the maturation of sleep patterns is the coincident change in feeding and metabolism during development . DN1a clock neurons anatomically and functionally connect to Dh44 arousal output neurons to
[RESULTS] To determine if the absence of rhythmic sleep-wake patterns in L2 might be related to feeding patterns , we examined larval feeding rate ( # mouth hook contractions in a 5-min period ) under constant conditions at 4 times across the day ( Circadian Time [ CT ] 1 , CT7 , CT13 , and CT19 ) in developmentally age-matched 2nd ( L2 ) and early 3rd instar ( L3 ; 72 hr AEL ) larvae . In contrast to their role in adult Dh44 neurons , knockdown of amino acid sensing genes , Gcn2 and crc , in Dh44 neurons did not disrupt rhythmic changes in sleep duration and bout number in L3 ( Figure 5H and I
[DISCUSSION] Our CCHa1 peptide data suggest that Dh44 neurons may undergo changes in CCHa1-R expression or subcellular localization between the L2 and L3 stages : we only observed an increase in Dh44 neural activity in response to the bath application of CCHa1 peptide at the L3 stage ( Figure 4E and F ) . In this model , changes in CCHa1-R subcellular localization allow Dh44 neurons to become competent to receive clock-driven cues , while this or other Dh44-derived signals promote circuit connectivity with DN1as to drive consolidation of sleep at the L3 stage . Additionally , while our study focuses on presumed CCHa1 synaptic signaling between DN1a and Dh44 neurons , we can not rule out the possibility of CCHa1 volume transmission from DN1as or other sources as contributors to sleep-wake regulation . Maintaining energy homeostasis and sensing of the nutritional environment are likely conserved regulators of sleep-wake rhythm development , as young mice
[METHODS] Early second or third instar larvae were starved for 1 hr and then fed 75 µl of 25 mg/mL Gaboxadol ( hydrochloride ) ( Thomas Scientific , Cat No : C817P41 ) in diluted yeast solution for 1 hr prior to loading in LarvaLodge containing 120 µl of 3 % agar and 2 % sucrose media covered with a",,968,97,None,"Sleep is a process in which the body adjusts to its environment . It is important to understand how the body responds to changes in the environment , such as changes in temperature , or changes in food . In the fruit fly Drosophila , sleep and feeding are consolidated to specific times of day , with flies eating more in the day than the night . However , the timing of these changes is not known . The development of the circadian clock is based on changes in energy consumption , and it is not clear how this changes affect sleep and eating patterns . To investigate this question , Wang et al . studied larvae of fruit fly larvae in the 3rd instar phase of fruit fly development . These larvae ate more during the day compared to the night when they were young . They also ate less during the night than they did during the morning . When larvae were grown , they ate a lot more during their sleep , but not during the evening . This suggests that changes in feeding and sleeping patterns are a key factor in the development of sleep-circadian rhythms . Wang and Wang found that larvae that ate too much in the morning were more likely to have a deeper sleep than larvae who ate at the same time . Further experiments showed that larval arousal neurons in the larvae’s brain communicate with the neurons in their brains to drive the formation of the sleep-wake rhythm . Furthermore , larvae with higher levels of glucose metabolism were more able to develop sleep-related behaviors . Thus , these findings suggest that changes to the nutritional demands of developing organisms may play a role in regulating sleep-regulation ."

[ABSTRACT] When reaching their maximum sustained swimming speed , fish swimming in schools had a 44 % higher maximum aerobic performance and used 65 % less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary individuals , which lowered the TEE and total cost of transport by up to 53 % , near the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism . The non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance which is likely to be beneficial for evading predators . By characterizing both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools of giant danio ( Devario aequipinnatus ) , we discovered that fish schools have a concave upward shaped metabolism-speed curve , with a minimum metabolic cost at ~1 body length s-1 . Many animals moving through fluids exhibit highly coordinated group movement that is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion . We demonstrate that fish schools reduce total energy expenditure ( TEE ) per tail beat by up to 56 % compared to solitary fish . However , direct energetic measurements demonstrating the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements remain elusive . These energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes . Fish in schools also recovered from exercise 43 % faster than solitary fish .
[INTRODUCTION] Our current understanding of energy saving mechanisms during collective locomotion in fishes is largely based on computational fluid dynamic models with a few analyses using robotic systems at low speed , but the link between such models and fish metabolic energy saving over a wide speed range is not yet established . This enabled us to simultaneously measure energetics , 3-D dynamics of fish schools ( n=5 replicate schools ) , and the kinematics of solitary fish ( n=5 ) of a model species , giant danio ( Devario aequipinnatus ) , that exhibits an active directional group swimming from near still water to maximum sustained speeds ( equivalent to a Reynolds number range of 6 . We hypothesize that fish in schools can reduce the total cost of high-speed locomotion relative to solitary movement , leading to reduced non-aerobic energetic costs and time of recovery for schooling fish swimming at speeds occupying the majority ( > 50 % ) of their aerobic capacity . Fish schools in nature swim over a wide range of speeds ( Appendix 1-figure 1 ) but no study has directly characterized the total energy expenditure ( TEE ) , and accounted for the potentially substantial anaerobic metabolic costs involved in higher speed locomotion . For swimming fish , fluid dynamic experiments have shown how collective movement can improve swimming efficiency due to interactions among deforming bodies and through interactions between moving animals and the local fluid environment ( these energy-saving mechanisms are summarized in Figure 1 ) . To overcome gravitational or fluid dynamic resistance to forward motion , animals use both aerobic and glycolytic metabolism ( oxidative and substrate-level phosphorylation at the cellular level ) to generate energy and sustain movement in the air , on land , and in the water . In water , a fluid that is 50 times more viscous than air and contains much less O2 per Kg than air , the need for aquatic animals to reduce fluid dynamic drag for energy conservation is even greater than for aerial or terrestrial locomotion . Another factor of importance in the experimental evaluation of the energetic cost of collective locomotion in fishes is that endurance and efficiency are often key to achieving lifetime fitness , especially in fish species that undergo significant
[RESULTS] Notably , the energetic benefits during active directional schooling occur when fish schools become more streamlined , as the length of fish school increased with speed and plateaued beyond 2 BL s-1 ( Figure 3F ) , while the 3-D distance among individuals stayed relatively constant at ~1 . To answer the question of how schooling dynamics reduces TEE , we combine video analysis of fish tail beat kinematics with simultaneous aerobic and anaerobic measurements to compute energy expended per tail beat ( TEE•beat-1 ) , and compared values for fish in schools to those for solitary fish . To estimate the relative proportions of aerobic and anaerobic energy contributions for locomotion at each swimming speed , we modeled
[DISCUSSION] The direct link between higher energetic costs caused by a higher 3-D body angle and higher turning frequency at the lowest speeds in solitary danio ( Figure 4D , E ) supports previous results in skates where energetic costs are high at the very low swimming speeds due to the increased energetic cost involved in maintaining body stability and generating lift in negatively buoyant fishes . While we can not completely preclude the possibility that elongation of danio fish school might be due to the weaker individuals falling behind , the fact that the school maintained a stable 3-D distance as speed increased and that fish continued to change position within the school suggests that the elongated school volume at higher speeds may reflect changing hydrodynamic interactions among individuals ( Figure 1 ) . We expect more species that move in the fluid to show a higher postural cost in near-still fluid but careful measurements

This can be achieved by moving their bodies at high speeds , or by moving at a slower speed . However , it is not clear how these movements are able to reduce the energy required to move . One way to reduce energy consumption is to use more energy , such as oxygen , than is needed to move in the air . In aquatic animals , this is called collective movement , and it is thought that collective movement can reduce the amount of energy that is needed for movement . But it is unclear how this can be done . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called X-ray crystallography to measure the energy expenditure of fish swimming in schools . The experiments showed that fish swimming at high speed had a higher aerobic capacity than solitary fish , which is the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism . Wang , etting , Kim ed . also found that fish in schools had fewer non-aerobic energy compared to secluded fish . These results suggest that collective group movement can be beneficial for avoiding predators by reducing energy consumption . For example , when fish in schooling swim at speeds occupying the majority of their aerobic capacity , they use less energy than those in sandflies . Furthermore , fish in classes also recovered from exercise 43 times faster than a sledfish . Overall , these findings suggest that coordinated group movement is a common feature of aquatic animals and may help them to avoid extinction ."

[ABSTRACT] We examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ; as a model of blood derived macrophages ) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung . Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ driven cytokine production in AM , indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM , which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis . Airway macrophages ( AM ) are the predominant immune cell in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection , making them a target for host directed therapy . Directly comparing responses between macrophages , AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM . A knowledge gap remains in understanding metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations , especially in lung resident AM . These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM . Upon stimulation , AM do not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM which shift to 'Warburg'-like metabolism . These data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases . Human macrophages , regardless of origin , had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or upon stimulation . MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40 , whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis . Interestingly , TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM . IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation . Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism . IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM .
[INTRODUCTION] Despite a large body of evidence indicating that these tissue resident AM have a distinct phenotype and function to peripherally derived macrophages , there remains a significant lack of data regarding human AM function and plasticity in response to infection and their ability to change under the influence of Th1 or Th2 environments . There is a paucity of data on the role of metabolism in response to Th1 or Th2 microenvironments induced by cytokines such as IFN-γ or IL-4 respectively , in human macrophages , especially in tissue resident macrophages , such as AM . To further examine the function of IFN-γ or IL-4 primed macrophages , we stimulated cells with the gram-negative bacterial component , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , or whole bacteria , irradiated Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ; iH37Rv ) . Herein the functional plasticity is defined as the ability of primed macrophages to differentially alter cytokine production in response to bacterial stimuli whereas the phenotypic plasticity is defined by alterations in surface expression of activation markers . A knowledge gap remains as to whether the tissue resident AM is metabolically and functionally plastic and therefore capable of mounting effective pro-inflammatory responses despite its homeostatic , regulatory tissue resident phenotype . Since AM play a key role in directing and propagating immune responses and inflammation in the lung , we sought to determine the plasticity of AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ) . Therefore , using the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose ( 2DG ) we then examined the mechanistic role of glycolysis in the phenotypic and functional plasticity of both AM and MDM . Furthermore , these data address a knowledge gap in human respiratory innate immunology and provide evidence that the AM is a tractable target to support human respiratory health . Macrophage function exists on a spectrum of activation states based on tissue residency , ontogeny , cytokine milieu and the plasticity of the macrophage in response to environmental factors . Much of the research has focused on the contribution of metabolic pathways to polarising macrophages into distinct pro-inflammatory or regulatory phenotypes . Furthermore , subsequent stimulation led to an increase in the extracellular
[RESULTS] Having established that energetic responses are plastic in response to IFN-γ in the AM and that post stimulation energetic responses are different in human macrophage types under Th1 or Th2 priming conditions , we next sought to determine the effect on the plasticity of the macrophage phenotype by examining expression of activation markers associated with antigen presentation function . These data indicate that whilst the peak of glycolysis is elevated in IFN-γ primed AM ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1A ) , all AM have a similar capacity to increase glycolysis upon stimulation when baseline differences in metabolism were adjusted for the effects of cytokine priming ( Figure 1C ) . Since IFN-γ
[DISCUSSION] While we have established herein that the human AM is plastic in response to IFN-γ , since the AM is yolk-sac derived and long-lived , this raises the question of whether the plasticity of the AM can allow multiple sequential changes to respond and adapt to changing microenvironments in the lung . Our data demonstrates that cytokine production in human AM can be promoted by supporting cellular metabolism , thus providing evidence that human tissue resident AM are a tractable target for host-directed immuno-supportive adjunctive therapies . Future experiments should examine how virulent respiratory pathogens such as gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Mtb affect human AM in Th1 or Th2 environments , to determine infection-specific effects . Our data supports the hypothesis that there may be distinct roles for AM and infiltrating MDM during infection since IFN-γ increased metabolic responses are mechanistically
[METHODS] Human AM were retrieved with informed consent from patients ( aged between 42-72 , 50 % Female ) undergoing bronchoscopy , ( ethical approval , St. James ' Hospital ( SJH ) / Tallaght University Hospital ( TUH ) Joint Research Ethics Committee ) previously as reported and outlined below . Exclusion criteria included age",,994,98,None,"Airway macrophages ( AMs ) are the most important immune cells in the body , and they are responsible for preventing infections . They also help to control inflammation in the airways , which can lead to lung cancer . However , it is not clear how AMs respond to a variety of stimuli , such as a bacterial infection , or if they are able to produce a specific type of cytokine . In particular , AMs can be found in the bloodstream , where they are known to act as inflammatory mediators . These cells are called macrophagoids , but they are also known to be involved in a number of other processes . One of these processes is called glycolysis . This process is thought to be responsible for the production of a protein called TNF . During this process , the molecules that are produced by the macrophagocytes are oxidized , causing them to become more active . The oxidation of the oxidative phosphorylation of TNF is regulated by a chemical called IFN- . It is thought that this chemical is responsible for how the cytokines produced by AMs change . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called 2-deoxyglucose to study the effects of IFN on AM and monocyte-derived macrophagoids ( MDM ) in the lung .

[ABSTRACT] We demonstrate that these bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night , by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants , who alter their headings in response . Finally , we show the long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants ' path integration system throughout the night for homing , as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day . Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere , and solar polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals . Furthermore , these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month , even under crescent moons , when polarised light levels are at their lowest . For the first time in any animal , we show that nocturnal bull ants use the exceedingly dim polarisation pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation . The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position ; however , they can often be obstructed by clouds , canopy , or the horizon . Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate . Despite being hidden , these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect . Here , we show evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants . Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun can not guide them . Moonlight produces an analogous pattern , albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight .
[INTRODUCTION] While it has been theorised that this ability to detect the much dimmer polarisation pattern produced by the moon may be present across nocturnal insects more broadly , including nocturnal bees and crickets , there is currently no behavioural evidence for its use in goal-directed navigation . Finally , we characterised changes in weighting that these ant navigators give polarised moonlight , as a function of the moon 's overnight consistency in the sky ( waxing vs. waning ) and the length of their accumulated path integrator , which should increase the weight given to celestial compass portion of the path integrator when in conflict with terrestrial visual cues . Given that the moon creates a much dimmer version of the polarisation pattern formed around the sun , only night-navigating insects with eyes highly specialised for low-light detection may be able to rely on this pattern to orient and navigate to goals . We also explored whether these navigators weigh their attendance to polarised moonlight across the lunar cycle , since during quarter-moon and crescent-moon nights , smaller portions of the moon 's surface reflect sunlight ( as well as moonless nights when no ambient e-vector is present ) . Yet these celestial bodies are not always directly visible , often obscured by clouds , the canopy , or after passing below the horizon , resulting in gaps for navigation relying solely upon direct visual detection . We know that two well-studied nocturnal ant species , Myrmecia pyriformis , and Myrmecia midas , use the overhead solar polarised light pattern , which is still visible during the twilight period to derive compass information . In the current study , we studied foraging ants ' ability to orient during lunar twilight , by placing and rotating a linear polarising filter over them as they returned to the nest ( Figure 1A ) . The scattering of this light creates an e-vector pattern in the sky , which is arranged in concentric circles around the sun or moon 's position with the maximum degree of polarisation located 90° from the source . Yet interestingly , these beetles do not use moonlight to navigate , instead relying on this pattern to keep moving
[RESULTS] Under a ( waxing ) Full Moon with lunar illumination above 80 % , when the linear polariser was rotated clockwise ( +45° ) , exit orientations were shifted to the right of initial headings ( mean ± s. e. m. Nest 1 : 38 . When no ambient lunar e-vector was present ( No Moon ) and the polariser was rotated either clockwise ( +45° ) or counter-clockwise ( -45° ) , foragers did not significantly alter their paths under the filter ( +45° : Moore 's Paired Test , R=0 . Under a Waning Quarter Moon ( lunar illumination ~50 % ) , when the e-vector was rotated clockwise ( +45° ) ,
[DISCUSSION] These findings suggest that under the filter , foragers use any available celestial and terrestrial cues that are still visible , yet the weighting of the polarisation pattern appears to change in accordance with the vector state and not its test location close to the nest tree , which could be a potentially highly salient landmark . However , the shift reductions on nights where there was no access to the lunar polarisation cue until just prior to tests ( lunar twilight before moonrise ) , suggests these foragers may need some set period of exposure to the moon 's polarisation pattern to employ it fully during inbound homing . This means that even if the ant fully shifts its heading , the delay will cause our measurements at the filter exit to slightly underestimate each individual 's position since we measure the angle from where the lunar cue
[METHODS] In the first test ( called Halfway Collect & Release ) , outbound foragers were only allowed to travel half the distance ( ~3 m ) to their foraging tree before being collected and were then released back at this spot to be tested under the ±45° filter rotations at ~2 m from the nest with a",,979,97,None,"During the day , the sun or moon can provide directional information to animals . However , they can often be obscured by clouds , canopy , or the horizon , resulting in gaps for navigation relying solely on direct visual cues .

This polarisation pattern is a million times dimer than sunlight , but it is still visible during the night , even under crescent moons , where it is reflected by the sun . Yet , many foraging ants do not use this pattern to navigate . Instead , instead rely on a pattern of light that is much less dim than the sun’s light . Now , Wang et al . have used a new technique to study the ability of nocturnal ants to navigate during night . The experiments show that the ant species , Myrmecia pyriformis , use a polarising filter over them as they return home from the nest , and rotate the filter to make it more visible . These ants change their headings in response to the light , changing their direction in response . In addition , these ants can also use polarized moonlight to guide them to their destination .

[ABSTRACT] Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight , but how this was achieved has been unclear , especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats . These tails ended in a tall , thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight . The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness , allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure . Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass , potentially benefiting flight control . Here , we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs . Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight .
[INTRODUCTION] These structures are presumed to have minimised fluttering and prevented buckling in the same way that spars , ribs , stringers , and longerons do in airplane wings and tail-fins , but others have proposed that they were flexible and cartilaginous , especially since their preserved appearance varies . A primary role in display has also been suggested , given ontogenetic shape changes in the vane and the fact that , unlike most aircraft , flying animals do not need vertical control surfaces to be yaw-stable during turns . Here , we use laser-simulated fluorescence ( LSF ) imaging of Rhamphorhynchus specimens from the Upper Jurassic Solnhofen Limestones to investigate the vane 's structural properties , explore its usage , its evolutionary origins and the context for its disappearance in later pterodactyloids . The length and stiffening of the tails suggest that they might have been important in early pterosaurs for control based on mass shifting or inertial control , as purported for terrestrial theropods with convergent tails . Tail vanes feature thick , evenly spaced , internal structures roughly perpendicular to the caudal series , that are said to resemble neural spines and haemal arches . The first pterosaurs , the non-pterodactyloids , had long , stiff tails with a mobile base , similar to some dinosaurs like Velociraptor . Many of these tails end in a soft tissue 'vane ' , which may have contributed to passive stability in flight .

Such dynamic control could greatly improve maneuverability and/or stability . Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight . The vanes have been interpreted as steering aids .

To our knowledge , in NHMUK PV OR 37003 alone , there is a second layer of thinner and more numerous fibres that run across the thick vertical structures , subparallel to the long axis of the tail and become more and more closely spaced as they reach the tail tip . At its widest point , about two-thirds along its length , the vane is 41
[DISCUSSION] Over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch at the Bayerische Staatssamlung für Paläontologie ( Munich ) , Museum für Naturkunde ( Berlin ) , Jura Museum ( Eichstätt ) , Natural History Museum ( London ) , National Museum of Scotland ( Edinburgh ) , and Royal Ontario Museum ( Toronto ) representing the pterosaur inventories in their care . The skull is partially preserved but severely deformed and eroded , with an outline of the paired ramus ( 70 mm rami length ) and upper crania , retaining anterior dentition with larger teeth ( 14 mm ) displaced anteriorly to the preserved jaws . Out of this significant sample , only four specimens were found to preserve tail vane soft tissues , which were then imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence at the Natural History Museum , National Museum of Scotland , and the Royal Ontario Museum .

They had long , stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass . These tails ended in a tall , thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight , which would be extremely costly and destabilising if the vane was tensioned while under aerodynamic load . The tail vanes have been interpreted as steering aids , but how they were achieved has been unclear . In the early Jurassic pterosaurus , the tails of the ptersaur Rhamphorhynchus were long stiff tail-like structures . Many of these tails had a flat , flexible base that would shift their centre of mass and could shift its center of gravity . However , if they fluttered too much , it would be very costly and unusable . This is because the tail vane was lost in later psterosars and is absent in birds and bats . Now , Wang et al . have used laser-stimulated fluorescence imaging to investigate the structure of the tail vane of the RHAMphorhyes . Using a technique called laser-simulated fluoresceinescence , they show that the tail of Rhamphosaur had long stiff legs , similar to those of some dinosaurs and birds . It was thought that these legs were important for flight control , as they could shift the center of their mass , potentially benefiting flight control and vane to function as a display structure .

[ABSTRACT] Here , we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine differences in dopamine release as well as mechanisms that underlie differential dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of adolescent ( P28-35 ) and adult ( P70-90 ) male rats . Results herein suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence , involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release . We show baseline differences between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in male rats , as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) on modulating dopamine release . Strikingly , blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that this α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur . These behavioral changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood , but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders . The α6-selective blocker , α-conotoxin , increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats , but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood . Major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie , in part , the associated behavioral changes and increased vulnerability . We confirm the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo using microdialysis . Adolescence is characterized by changes in reward-related behaviors , social behaviors , and decision-making .
[INTRODUCTION] Thus , the relationship between adolescent and adult dopamine release is opposite in females , and , therefore , either ( 1 ) the mechanisms explored here will likely not be the same for females as males , or ( 2 ) there is a secondary effect that masks this mechanism in females by altering the relationship we observe at baseline . Our lab has previously shown that the maximum concentration of evoked dopamine release is decreased in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of early adolescent male rats , though the mechanism responsible for differentially regulating dopamine release in adolescent and adult rats remains unclear . Since previous research from our lab revealed that the NAc core has the largest difference in stimulated dopamine release between adult and adolescent male rats , we focused this report on understanding the mechanisms mediating dopamine release in that region . This local control over terminal dopamine release has important implications for how dopamine encodes salient information and drives behavior , and one or more of the regulatory mechanisms that mediate terminal dopamine release may change between adolescence and adulthood . Therefore , the purpose of this study is to investigate the role of local modulators on presynaptic NAc dopamine release of adult and adolescent male rats is the mechanism responsible for driving such developmental changes . Since these mechanisms are more than likely sexually dimorphic , we focus here on parsing out the mechanism involved in the changes seen within the adolescent and adult male dopaminergic system . Here , we use ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry ( FSCV ) to compare stimulated dopamine release and local circuitry regulation in the NAc core of adult and adolescent male rats . While reports examining extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum show both lower and higher levels of dopamine during adolescence , sub-second stimulated dopamine release is consistently found to be decreased in the striatum of adolescent rats . Reorganization of the dopamine system is hypothesized to underlie many of the changes in adolescent behavior , particularly in reward-related learning and decision-making , and the increased vulnerability to developing psychiatric disorders . This may be , in part , because the brain is still developing during
[RESULTS] When we compared dopamine release and the impact of α-Ctx on dopamine release in mid-adolescent rats ( P39-42 ) and adults ( P70-90 ) , there was no age-related difference in raw dopamine release ( main effects of age and age X frequency interaction : F < 1 ) ( Figure 3A , C ) or in α-Ctx modulation of dopamine release ( expressed as a percentage of pre-α-Ctx , single-pulse release ) in the NAc core ( Figure 3B , C ) . To investigate whether the differential modulation of dopamine release by α-Ctx in early adolescent and adult rats is mediated through a multi-synaptic mechanism mediated by GABA , we antagonized GABAA and GABAB receptors
[DISCUSSION] Although prior research has found no difference in the density of α6-containing nAChRs in the NAc of early adolescents and adults , differences in localization or functionality of either α6-containing nAChRs or GABA receptors may underlie changes that create this novel multisynaptic mechanism of dopamine regulation in adolescent males . Interestingly , one report using adult mice found that antagonizing GABAB receptors increased dopamine release when β2-containing nAChRs were antagonized , indicating that GABA and nAChRs have a potentially complex and reciprocal regulation of dopamine release that we suggest here may be age/developmental stage dependent . A previous study from our lab using adult rats found that those rats most vulnerable to sensation seeking and markers of SUD display a similar pattern of dopamine release to adolescent rats in the present study , particularly with respect to how α6-containing nAChRs modulated dopamine release . We examined CIN influence on dopamine release

[ABSTRACT] Thus , our studies demonstrate that genetically distinct ASD subtypes have common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration which are driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation . 2 deletion , have common reductions in neural precursor cell ( NPC ) neurite outgrowth and migration even though whole genome sequencing demonstrates no genetic overlap between the datasets . mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in all NPCs across both ASD subtypes , and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism NPC-associated phenotypes in control NPCs . Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is defined by common behavioral characteristics , raising the possibility of shared pathogenic mechanisms . Surprisingly despite the genetic heterogeneity , hundreds of shared p-peptides were identified between autism subtypes including the mTOR pathway . To identify signaling differences that may contribute to these developmental defects , an unbiased phospho- ( p ) -proteome screen was performed . Surprisingly , our iPSC studies find that six individuals from two distinct ASD subtypes , idiopathic and 16p11 . Yet , vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity suggests personalized phenotypes .
[INTRODUCTION] However , many of these studies focused on terminally differentiated neurons , with very few examining developmental events that correspond to mid-fetal cortical development that precede synapse formation , such as neurite outgrowth and cell migration . Surprisingly , our EF studies revealed that all unaffected NPCs responded to selected EFs with increases in neurite outgrowth and migration while I-ASD NPCs failed to respond to any of the tested EFs , suggesting the possibility of impaired signaling pathways . To begin addressing these questions , we studied early neurite development and cell migration using human iPSC-derived NPCs from two different autism subtypes - an idiopathic cohort ( I-ASD ) and a genetically defined CNV 16p11 . Furthermore , to expand our understanding of NPC response to mid-fetal environmental stimuli , we stimulated NPCs with extracellular factors ( EFs : growth factors , neuropeptides , neurotransmitters ) that are expressed in the mid-fetal period and are known to regulate neurodevelopment . Now , with the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) technology , we can study human neural development in cells derived from individuals with both genetic and idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders . About 10-15 % of autism cases are genetically defined and caused by single gene mutations or copy number variants ( CNVs ) while most of ASD etiology remains undefined or idiopathic . Overall , our studies indicate that despite the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity , two distinct ASD subtypes have dysregulation of mTOR signaling which mediates the surprisingly uniform neurodevelopmental phenotypes . Thus , to identify mediating signaling pathways , an unbiased p-proteome analysis was conducted , which showed significant overlap in p-peptides between I-ASD and 16pDel datasets with less overlap in the total proteome . Moreover , there is little insight into whether and how extracellular factors ( EFs ) , which coordinate neurodevelopment by regulating signaling , contribute to ASD pathogenesis in human NPCs . Consequently , our insight into a majority of ASD pathophysiology has been limited and we have little knowledge of the similarities and differences between idiopathic and genetically defined autisms . Several studies have uncovered the convergence of both rare and common variant ASD risk genes onto the developing mid-fetal cerebral cortex ( 8-24 weeks ) . Moreover , modulation of the mTOR pathway with small molecules rescued and reproduced ASD NPC phenotypes indicating that mTOR
[RESULTS] Thus , to further investigate if this failure to respond to EFs is due to mTOR signaling defects , we treated the I-ASD NPCs with 'subthreshold ' amounts of mTOR agonist and inhibitor which did not maximally increase p-S6 or elicit neurite outgrowth on its own . Given the common neurite impairment in all I-ASD NPCs , we then extended our studies to another critical cytoskeleton-dependent mid-fetal developmental process , NPC migration , which occurs concurrently with neurite outgrowth and is similarly regulated during development . We analyzed these 12 individuals ( six I-ASD-Sib and six 16pDel-NIH ) extensively for developmental phenotypes utilizing two to five clones per individual ( except for NIH ) and two to five independent neural inductions to ensure
[DISCUSSION] Response to EFs could also have implications for the treatment of individuals with ASD , for example , SSRI are commonly used to treat comorbid depression/anxiety in ASD , but if these individuals have neural cells that are less responsive to 5-HT , this treatment could be less effective , though further research is needed to understand whether NPC responses to EFs/drugs correlate with drug responses in the individual . In our study , we selected three EFs , PACAP , NGF , and 5-HT , known to be expressed during the 'critical window ' of mid-fetal development , with well-established roles in regulation of early neurodevelopmental phenotypes to stimulate I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs in both our neurite outgrowth and neurosphere assays to assess for ASD-specific response differences . Given that the non-overlapping variants could potentially converge onto the mTOR pathway , we subsequently ran IPA on WGS data which did not uncover convergence onto the mTOR pathway or any
[METHODS] After annotation , variants were selected based on the following criteria : ( 1 ) have a 'PASS ' value in the FILTER field ; ( 2 ) have an AF < 5 % in database gnomAD_genome_ALL ; ( 3 ) exonic variants with the functional categories of 'non-synonymous ' , 'frameshift_deletion ' , 'frameshift_insertion ' , 'nonframeshift_deletion ' , 'nonframeshift_",,950,96,None,"Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is a genetic disorder that affects about a third of people in the world . It is caused by a mutation in a gene called mTOR , which controls the development of neurons in the brain . However , it is not clear how this gene affects how neurons develop and develop . To investigate this question , a team of scientists from the University of California , Berkeley , and the University at Buffalo used a technique called induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) to study human neurons from two different ASD subtypes . The experiments showed that the genes that cause ASD are common , but that the differences between the two subtype groups are not known . This suggests that the genetic differences may be due to differences in the signaling pathways that control the growth and development of the neurons . Moreover , the differences in how the genes are expressed in the neurons are not clear . In addition , there is no evidence that a single gene is responsible for the differences . Now , Liu et al . have used iPSCs to study the development and growth of neurons from individuals with both genetic and idiopathic autism . These experiments show that , although the genes involved in ASD have been identified , they are not the same . Furthermore , these studies show that the gene that causes ASD has been found to be a common molecule , called p-peptide , that is found in all neurons in both ASDs , even though whole genome sequencing reveals no genetic overlap between the datasets"

[ABSTRACT] These high SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous EPSCs , lower voltage thresholds , tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites , shorter response latencies , and higher initial release rates . Here , we aimed at bridging this gap by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization . A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells ( IHCs ) and spiral ganglion neurons ( SGNs ) in the cochlea . While a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity seems likely , experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has remained difficult to obtain . This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs . Presynaptic active zones at the pillar IHC side activate at lower IHC potentials than those of the modiolar side that have more presynaptic Ca2+ channels . Synapses with high spontaneous rate of release ( SR ) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC . The postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates , sound thresholds , and operating ranges . Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry .
[INTRODUCTION] Using the rate of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents ( rate of sEPSCs , SR ) as a surrogate for SGN SR , we demonstrate that high SR synapses have larger and more compact sEPSCs as well as lower voltage thresholds , shorter latencies of evoked EPSCs ( eEPSCs ) , tighter Ca2+ channel coupling to vesicle release , and higher initial release rates . One common approach has been to capitalize on a pioneering study that employed in vivo labeling of physiologically characterized SGNs in cats and proposed that synapses formed by low and high SR SGNs segregate on the basal IHC pole . For example , the cochlea might use heterogeneous afferent synapses to break down sound intensity information into complementary spike rate codes of SGNs that have been reported along the tonotopic axis of the cochlea for several species . Decades of in vivo recordings from single SGNs have demonstrated functional diversity of SGNs with comparable frequency tuning , i. e. , receiving input from IHCs at a given tonotopic place or potentially even the same IHC . The low voltage of activation of release at pillar synapses shown ex vivo could underly the high SR and low sound threshold of firing of SGNs found in vivo but direct demonstration of such a link has been missing . Beyond the diversity across synapses formed by different neurons and at different places , heterogeneity exists even among auditory synapses formed by an individual presynaptic inner hair cell ( IHC ) with its 5-30 postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons . We performed paired IHC and SGN bouton recordings in acutely explanted organs of Corti from hearing mice with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic in vivo SGN characterization . Pillar synapses are preferentially formed by type Ia SGNs , have smaller IHC active zones ( AZs ) , and activate at voltages as low as the IHC resting potential . Synaptic diversity occurs at various levels : from synapse shape and size , to the ultrastructure of pre- and postsynaptic specializations , to their molecular composition . Synaptic heterogeneity has been found at different tonotopic positions of the cochlea and is a candidate mechanism for how the cochlea decomposes acoustic information . In response to increasing sound pressure , SGNs with high SR
[RESULTS] Under our experimental conditions , spontaneous , i. e. , excitatory postsynaptic currents in the absence of IHC stimulation ( sEPSCs ) were observed in 23 of 33 pairs ( Figure 1B , Figure 2 , 20 recordings were targeted to the pillar side and 13 to the modiolar side ) . Following the spontaneous firing rate classification of mouse SGNs by Taberner and Liberman , 2005 , we classified the synapses into low ( < 1 sEPSC/s , ~70 % ) or high ( ≥1 sEPSC/s , ~30 % ) SR synapses ( see Figure 2A for examples ) . We used step depolarizations to emulate physiological receptor potentials given that mature IHCs of the 'high-frequency ' mouse
[DISCUSSION] Other important factors might explain the higher SR reported in vivo : ( i ) The intrinsic biophysical properties of SGNs which could further expand the firing rate distribution , for instance , due to spikes initiated intrinsically and not activated by an EPSP ; ( ii ) a sampling bias of synapses with SR above 20 sEPSC/s given that they constitute less than 35 % of SGNs from 8- to 17-week-old mice ; and ( iii ) the developmental recruitment of high SR SGNs with age . This might reflect two important technical differences : ( i ) single synapse imaging assessed the presynaptic Ca2+ influx of the specific synapse , while in paired recordings we related release to the whole-cell Ca2+ influx , and ( ii ) the temporal resolution of paired recordings allowed to study the initial release rate using shorter stimuli than in imaging , which avoids an impact of
[METHODS] Single AZ pool dynamics were determined by fitting an exponential plus line function to the first 50 ms of the average QEPSC trace in response to the masker stimulus for each ISI , y0+A1 ( 1−exp { − ( x−x0 ) τ } ) + ( x−x0 ) slope where A1 is the amplitude of the exponential component ,",,965,97,None,"The cochlea is a large organ that contains many different types of neurons , including the inner hair cells ( IHCs ) and spiral ganglion neurons ( SGNs for short ) .

In addition , they are found at different locations in the brain , such as in the lungs , the heart , or the brain’s eardrums . The brain uses these connections to encode information about sounds , but it is not clear how these connections work . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called afferent synapses to record the activity of the SGN neurons in the inner and outer hair cells of mice . Using this technique , a group of mice were given a stimulus and conditions that allowed them to listen to the sounds of their environment . When the mice were exposed to these conditions , their brains recorded a series of recordings of the signals that they received from the IHC and SGN cells . This revealed that the signaling activity of these neurons varied between the two groups of neurons: the high-frequency , low-frequency and high-amplitude signals . However , when the mice had been exposed to the same stimuli , these signals were different , with the higher-frequency signals being more likely to be more intense than the low- frequency signals , which were less likely to have been more intense .

[ABSTRACT] In this study , using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches , we demonstrate that PfMORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle , but is also essential to the parasite survival . Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) experiments suggests that PfMORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but may also play a role in modulating stage transition . Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture ( Hi-C ) studies indicate that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death . The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite , Plasmodium falciparum , faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation . All together these findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation , validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies . Accumulating evidence has shed light on the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites . Microrchidia ( MORC ) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms .
[INTRODUCTION] Immunofluorescence-based assays and ChIP-seq experiments show that PfMORC localizes to heterochromatin clusters at or near var genes with significant overlap with well-known signatures of the parasite heterochromatin post-translational modification ( PTM ) H3K9-trimethylation ( H3K9me3 ) marks . PfMORC was also detected at a relatively high level throughout the parasite life cycle , including sporozoites and liver stages , and has been identified in several protein pull-down experiments as targeting both AP2 TFs and epigenetic factors . However , with the advent of sensitive technologies capable of capturing important chromatin associated regulatory complexes such as ChIP , chromatin conformation capture ( Hi-C ) technologies , and chromatin enrichment for proteomics ( ChEP ) , we can now solve important facets of molecular components controlling epigenetics and chromatin structure . To adapt to extreme environmental challenges , P. falciparum possesses unique strategies that direct the tightly coordinated changes in gene expression and control transcriptional switching in genes encoded by multigene families to ensure antigenic variation and immune evasion . All together our work provides significant insight into the role of PfMORC in the maintenance of the pathogens ' epigenetics and chromosomal architectural integrity and validates this protein as a promising target for novel therapeutic interventions . MORC belongs to a highly conserved nuclear protein superfamily with widespread domain architectures that link MORCs with signaling-dependent chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation across plant and animal kingdoms , including the apicomplexan parasites . It is believed that , to offset the relatively low TF range , Plasmodium has evolved additional mechanisms regulating gene expression including mechanisms that use epigenetics factors , RNA binding proteins , or regulate chromatin structure . The 27 apicomplexan APETALA2 ( ApiAP2 ) DNA-binding proteins are the only well-documented parasite TFs known to contribute to the modulation of gene expression throughout various stages of the parasite 's development . Recently , ChEP experiments done in P. falciparum identified PfMORC as one of the highest enriched chromatin-bound proteins at different stages of the parasite intraerythrocytic development cycle ( IDC ) . TgMORC-depleted cells also resulted in change in a gene expression with up regulation of secondary AP2 factors and a significant shift from asexual to sexual differentiation . All together these components work in combination to regulate the dynamic organization of DNA , and the
[RESULTS] ICED normalized intrachromosomal heatmaps displayed a high proportion of interactions at distances less than 10 % the length of each chromosome as well as strong subtelomeric interactions and internal regions containing genes involved in antigenic variation ( Figure 6a-b , Figure 6-figure supplements 2-5 ) This pattern was similar to those observed previously at various stages of the life cycle and confirm that genes involved in antigenic variation are usually confined within dense heterochromatin rich regions to aid the tight control of var genes necessary for their mutually exclusive expression and immune evasion . Although these results are compelling , the small overlap observed between the ChIP-seq signals and RNA-seq results indicates that major changes observed in gene expression
[DISCUSSION] While we were unable to confirm a direct role of PfMORC in the sexual conversion due to a nonsense mutation in AP2-G gene in our transfected lines , its strong interaction with AP2-G during the asexual cell cycle indicates that PfMORC in combination with other epigenetic factors may most likely control AP2-G expression and sexual differentiation . We now have powerful evidence demonstrating that PfMORC is not only critical for parasite cell cycle progression and its survival but also has a direct role in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing , including regulating immune evasion through antigenic variation . All together our work-demonstrated that in addition to its direct role in heterochromatin formation and antigenic variation , PfMORC may act as a potential repressor to control a set of parasite-specific genes including genes involved in parasite egress and invasion , and antigenic variation between the trophozoite to schizont stage transition .

The parasite is able to survive in a range of environments , including the environment , but it also has a unique ability to adapt to different environmental conditions . In particular , the parasite has evolved new strategies to control the changes in gene expression that occur during its life cycle . This includes a strategy called chromatin remodeling , which involves a protein called microrchidia , that is found in the chromosomes of many different plants and animals . However , it is not clear how this protein works . It has been suggested that microrchydia are involved in regulating the structure of the cytoplasm , a part of the DNA that is used to make proteins .

[ABSTRACT] While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors , it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts . Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts . Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health , prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions . Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing , we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas . The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors ( decreased nest-building , increased latency to eat a cookie , and reduced wheel running ) . Unraveling the interaction between the tumor , infiltrating nerves , and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer . The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor .
[INTRODUCTION] While the intensity and prevalence of psychological symptoms in cancer patients fluctuate before , during , and after treatment for a given type of cancer , and between cancer types , it remains higher than in the general population . The association of cancer with impaired mental health is directly mediated by the disease , its treatment or both ; these findings suggest that the development of a tumor alters brain functions . For instance , decade-long cancer survivors maintain an increased incidence of depression ( approximately 12 % , depending on the cancer type ) as compared to the population at large . While these and other studies establish that solid peripheral tumors engage with the peripheral nervous system , it raises the possibility of a direct neuronal connection from the tumor to the brain . The presence of cancer introduces many stressors ( physical , financial , relational ) into the lives of patients , thus a negative impact on mental health may not be surprising . A recent study used pseudorabies virus and mapped a connection from tumor-infiltrating nerves in an orthotopic model of murine lung cancer to areas in the brain . We have demonstrated the presence of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas , melanoma , cervical , and ovarian cancers . We expand these findings and demonstrate that HNSCC-associated nerves are transcriptionally and functionally altered and project to discrete regions in the brain . Nerve recruitment to the tumor bed is an active process that involves the release of soluble factors , including neurotrophins and neuropeptides . Our findings suggest that , in addition to pain , tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain that lead to cancer-associated changes in behavior . While pain treatment restored normal function at the tumor site , such as nesting behavior , it only partially restored normal voluntary running wheel behavior . The brain neurons connected to the tumor manifest increased activity , which is associated with behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing animals . The prevalence of mental health disorders ( e. g. depression , anxiety , suicide ) in cancer patients is significantly greater than in the general population . Consistent with this , newly diagnosed HNSCC patients suffer high rates of depression and anxiety and lower quality of life . For those patients with no prior psychiatric history
[RESULTS] Since HNSCC tumors cause oral pain and both nesting and the cookie test require the use of the mouth , we also evaluated the effect of nociceptor ablation on voluntary wheel running to gain additional insights into cancer-associated fatigue , a surrogate for depressive-like behaviors in tumor-bearing mice . To map the origin of tumor-infiltrating nerves and define the circuits they converge upon , mice with palpable oral MOC2-7 tumors ( approximately day 15 post-tumor implantation ) were intra-tumorally injected with wheat germ agglutinin , WGA , a neural tracer conjugated to a fluorophore ( n=10 mice ) . To evaluate the effects of this disruption on cancer-induced behavioral changes , we assessed the animals ' general well-being through nesting behavior and anhedonia
[DISCUSSION] Moreover , given that carprofen and buprenorphine decrease inflammation , their ability to restore normal nesting and cookie test behaviors ( which require the use of the oral cavity where the tumor is located ) suggests that inflammation at the tumor site contributed to the decline in these behaviors in vehicle-treated animals . These data show that the constraint imposed by the tumor on behavioral activities that require the use of the oral cavity is mainly due to pain and not to the physical interference of the tumor mass with the pattern of oral activities that need to take place for mice to perform the corresponding behavior . This revelation paves the way for in-depth exploration into the mechanistic underpinnings of cancer-associated alterations in well-being and mental health , shedding light on potential therapeutic interventions to alleviate these profound effects .

The majority of cancer patients have a mental health problem , which is often caused by the presence of a tumor . However , it is not clear how the tumor affects the mental health of those who have the disease .

In addition , the brain can also be affected by other factors , such as stress , including the amount of food they eat , and the size of their mouth . To understand how the brain interacts with the brain and how it affects mental health , Gupta et al . used a mouse model of head and neck cancer to study how nerves infiltrating tumors connect to different areas of the brain . Using a technique called neuronal tracing , these mice were injected with a drug called aglutinin . When the mice were given a dose of pain medication , their brain cells were able to detect the nerves that are connected to the tumor and , in turn , responded to the pain , making them more likely to respond to a cookie . These changes in behavior were also observed in the mice that had been treated with analgesics , but not for the mice whose brains were not affected by the pain treatment . Instead , when the tumor was removed , nociceptor neurons were activated , suggesting that the tumor-infiltrated nerves communicated signals to the brain that lead to mental health problems ."

[ABSTRACT] In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants , we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability , secondary structure , protein oligomeric state , particle formation , and liquid-liquid phase separation . In the Omicron variant , distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties , and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation . We find variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) sufficient to allow local plasticity , but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses . Taking advantage of the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2 , we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein . A picture emerges where genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species , in particular in the IDRs . Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success .
[INTRODUCTION] It proceeds via nucleic acid ( NA ) binding-induced conformational changes and oligomerization , leading to the formation of ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) particles with as-of-yet unknown molecular architecture , ≈38 of which are arranged like beads-on-a-string in the viral particle , and are anchored through binding of N-protein to viral M-protein . Biophysical fitness landscapes have been studied with regard to observables such as thermal stability of globular proteins , solvent accessibility , catalytic activity , or binding affinity of protein-protein interfaces , which has led to significant advances in understanding relationship between molecular properties , population fitness , and evolutionary processes . N-protein is the most abundant viral protein in the infected cell , and as we reported previously , it is also the most diverse structural protein with approximately 86 % of its 419 residues capable of assuming on average four to five different amino acids evidently without impairment of viability . With currently ≈15 million entries , this unprecedented large database has provided the basis for phylogenetic analyses that have identified critical amino acid mutations associated with immune evasion , infectivity , and disease severity , and allowed the rapid identification of variants of concern . Beyond this structural role , N-protein is highly multifunctional and binds to multiple host proteins to modulate or exploit different pathways , including stress granules , the type 1 interferon signaling pathway , the NLRP3 inflammasome , and others , as recently reviewed . In complementary biophysical experiments with several representative N-protein mutants derived from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern , we characterize their variation in thermodynamic stability , secondary structure , oligomeric state , energetics of NA binding , assembly , and LLPS propensity . Generally , intrinsic disorder and loose packing is a common characteristic of many RNA virus proteins , which is thought to promote functional promiscuity , permit greater diversity , and enhance evolvability to adopt new functions with few mutations . This diversity is also reflected in the ensemble of consensus sequences sampled across the infected host population , as is apparent in the GISAID ( Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data ) repository of SARS-CoV-2 genomes . In the present work we computationally evaluate the range of several biophysical traits resulting from diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein folded domains and IDRs across the
[RESULTS] We similarly subdivided the N-protein into different regions ( Figure 1A ) and grouped unique sets of mutations in each region : For the folded domains we found 720 distinct NTD ( N:45-179 ) and 399 distinct CTD ( N:248-363 ) sequences , while for the IDRs there are 512 N-arm ( N:1-44 ) , 1039 linker ( N:175-247 ) , and 556 C-arm ( N:364-419 ) sequences . It was found to modulate phosphorylation of cytosolic N-protein , enhance assembly in a VLP assay , and increase viral fitness ; ( 2 ) N : P13L/Δ31-33 carrying the mutation P13L and the deletion Δ31-33 that are part of the defining mutations of all Omicron variants , with P13L epidemiologically ranked
[DISCUSSION] It is interesting to note that the R203K/G204R mutation , the P13L mutation , and the P13L/Δ31-33 combination each can occur independently of each other in viable virus species , with 261 genomes in the database carrying only the P13L mutation , 9548 only the combination P13L/Δ31-33 , and > 50 , 000 genomes exclusively the double mutation R203K/G204R , even though their more frequent coexistence ( by approximately 10-fold , in all of Omicron variants ) might suggest epistatic interactions and a fitness advantage . Besides traditional sequence-based structure prediction and structure/function relationships , and more recent recognition of structural dynamics , new paradigms have emerged with increased understanding of the role of IDRs , their mimicry of SLiMs , nonlocal physicochemical properties of sequence regions , and the ability of IDRs to promote macroscopic phase separation to generate or usurp condensates with virus-related functions . It may seem as a paradox that despite this conservation

It is transmitted by a virus called RNA viruses , which can infect humans and other animals . Infection with the virus can lead to severe illness and death , but it is not known how the virus causes the disease . The virus has a large number of mutations that affect the structure of the virus , and it is thought that these mutations can cause the virus to become more resistant to the immune system . However , it is unclear how the viruses are able to adapt to the new environment , or how they can survive in the environment .

[ABSTRACT] Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation , whilst in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus , changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor unexpectedly led to higher levels in energy expenditure of type II , fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures ( 20 °C ) . Upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8 °C ( near the body temperature of torpid animals ) , we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77-107 % during torpor compared to active periods . As the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood , our study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization . Additionally , we observe that it is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potentially contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis . This may act as a potential molecular mechanism mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure . Altogether , we demonstrate that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals , contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle . Hibernation is a period of metabolic suppression utilized by many small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods . We then conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand . Additionally , we observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemilineatus , which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule . We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators , Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus and larger hibernators , Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus . In parallel , we performed multiple proteomics analyses .
[INTRODUCTION] In contrast , either medium ( 10-20 kg , e. g. European badger , Meles meles ) or large ( > 20 kg , e. g. Eurasian brown bear , Ursus arctos , and American black bear , Ursus americanus ) hibernating mammals exhibit a pronounced hypo-metabolic state ( as low as 25 % of their basal metabolic rate in the case of bears ) , but only experience a mild decline in body temperature ( to 32-35°C depending on body size ) that lasts for several winter months . For instance , small ( < 8 kg ) fat-storing hibernating mammals such as 13-lined ground squirrels ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ) or garden dormice ( Eliomys quercinus ) experience extended bouts of a hypo-metabolic state ( torpor ) , punctuated by spontaneous periods of interbout euthermic arousals ( IBA ) , during which metabolic activity transiently increases back to basal levels . Hibernation is an adaptive strategy employed by many animals aiming to decrease their metabolic rate and improve survival , particularly during harsh , winter conditions where food supply is limited , and thermogenic demands are high . What remains to be determined is whether , across mammals , increasing the proportions of myosin in the DRX or SRX states serves as a physiological molecular mechanism to fine-tune metabolic demands and thermogenesis . We employed a multifaceted approach : loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments to assess myosin conformation and ATP turnover time , X-ray diffraction for sarcomere structure evaluation , and proteomic analyses to quantify differential PTMs . Hence , in the present study , we hypothesized that a remodeling of the proportions of myosin DRX and SRX conformations within skeletal muscles occurs and is a major suppressor of ATP/metabolic demand during hibernation . In the 'disordered-relaxed ' ( DRX ) state , myosin heads are generally not bound to actin and structurally exist in a conformation ( so-called ON state ) where they primarily exist freely within the interfilamentous space in the sarcomere . Previous work has demonstrated that ground squirrels require an optimal dietary ratio of monounsaturated to polyunsaturated fats , approximately 2:1 , during
[RESULTS] To investigate whether resting myosin DRX and SRX states and their respective ATP consumption rates were altered during hibernation , we utilized the loaded Mant-ATP chase assay in isolated permeabilized muscle fibers from U. arctos obtained during either summer ( active period ) or winter ( hibernating period ) . We calculated the ATP consumed by myosin molecules by using the following equation based on the assumption that the concentration of myosin heads within single muscle fibers is 220 μM : MyosinATPconsumption ( fiber×min ) = ( P1/100 ) ×220× ( 60/T1 ) + ( P2/100 ) ×220× ( 60/T2 ) the ATP consumed by myosin molecules was not different between
[DISCUSSION] Our findings demonstrate that in small hibernators such as I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus , the ATP turnover time of relaxed myosin molecules ( in both DRX and SRX conformations ) is faster during torpor ( and IBA ) , especially in type II muscle fibers , leading to an unexpected overall increased ATP consumption . A study from Aydin et al. , 2008 , demonstrated in mice that when a shivering muscle , soleus , was prevented from undergoing non-shivering thermogenesis via knock-out of UCP1 and were subsequently exposed to cold temperatures , the force production of these muscles was significantly reduced due to prolonged shivering . It would furthermore ideally be possible to increase the biological sample size of all the species analysed in this study to further confirm the results which we report , particularly as modest differences are seen in
[METHODS] Precursors were filtered by charge state of 2-5 and multiple sequencing of peptides was minimized by excluding the selected peptide candidates for 60 s.

However , it is not clear how this is achieved . In some species , such as ground squirrels and garden dormice , the amount of fat in their muscles is reduced . This is because the body temperature is lower than normal , which means that the muscles are less active , and therefore less efficient . Hibernation is an adaptive strategy used by many animals to reduce their metabolic rate . For example , small mammals such as the 13-lined ground squirrel ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ) and large mammals ( Ursus arctos and Eliomys quercinus , respectively ) experience periods of a hypo-metabolic state ( torpor ) , punctuated by spontaneous periods of interbout euthermic arousals ( IBA ) that last for several winter months in order to improve survival . These periods are known as ‘shivering periods’ , when the body temperatures are low , but they are also known to increase in response to cold exposure . To investigate this question , Xu et al . used a technique called loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments to measure the levels of myosin in muscle fibers from small hibernators . The experiments showed that the levels in the muscle were reduced by 77–107% , while the levels increased in the resting state , suggesting that the activity of the muscle is regulated . Moreover , these changes were observed in the presence of cold , so that it is possible that a protein called Myh2 is involved in this process . Therefore , this could be a potential mechanism to reduce the amount and quantity of my"

[ABSTRACT] Overall , our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns , a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth . Surprisingly , analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation , implying incomplete rotation of the division plane . In this work , we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis . Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns , composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks , and small , disorganized clusters located in the outer edges . Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane , resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction . Broadly , this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development . Finally , correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion , whereas columns support elongation . Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated , they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction . Chondrocyte columns , which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture , play a central role in bone elongation .
[INTRODUCTION] The presence of clusters and columns correlated temporally with the rates of growth plate elongation and expansion , suggesting that these structures support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development , while highlighting the imperative role of 3D analysis when studying complex cellular arrangements . The growth plate , which is located at both ends of developing long bones , drives bone elongation by a tightly regulated process of cell proliferation and differentiation , which involves increase in cell size and their organization along the proximal-distal ( P-D ) axis . Originally , analyses of two-dimensional static images suggested that in the embryonic growth plate , columns form through a process akin to convergent extension , an evolutionarily conserved tissue elongation mechanism involving cell intercalation . Furthermore , studies in embryonic chick and mouse limbs have shown that cell surface signaling through the Fz/Vangl/PCP pathway plays a major role in regulating chondrocyte polarity and rearrangement and that GDF5 is involved in chondrocyte orientation . However , in the postnatal growth plate clones , the rate of complete cell rotations increases , leading to the formation of complex columns through a combination of stereotypical and non-stereotypic cell stacking , as well as of small , orthogonally oriented clusters . Instead , successive incomplete rotations during cell division result in non-stereotypic cell stacking that , in turn , give rise to elongated clusters oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal bone axis . Finally , studies in paralyzed mice and muscle-less mouse embryos Shwartz et al. , 2012 ; Pierantoni et al. , 2021 have uncovered the important role of muscle load in regulating cell polarity and column formation . Columnar arrangement of chondrocytes has been a subject of study for nearly a century , gaining attention due to the remarkable emergence of cellular order from the highly disordered RZ . This columnar arrangement facilitates bone elongation by maximizing cell density in the longitudinal axis while limiting it laterally , thereby constraining hypertrophic cell growth to the P-D axis . Over the years , numerous studies have been dedicated to deciphering the molecular and cellular processes underpinning the formation of columns and their involvement in bone elongation . These studies have identified beta 1 and
[RESULTS] For that , we used the same pipeline to analyze proximal tibia and distal femur growth plates from clonally labeled Col2a1-CreER : R26R-Confetti mice ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1A ) at P40 , 10 days after Cre induction . To examine this possibility , we allowed neighboring clones to join ( see 'Materials and methods ' ) and then performed orientation analysis , measuring the angle between the long axis of the multiclone with the P-D bone axis as before ( Figure 2H ) . For that , we measured the elevation angle between all neighboring pairs of cells ( doublets ) within a given clone , similar to what was done previously ( see details
[DISCUSSION] One limitation of our rotation analysis is that in order to calculate the relative position between neighboring cells , we assumed that chondrocyte rotation and orientation are correlated and that chondrocytes do not move after rotating , as was previously suggested . One plausible explanation is that earlier studies focused on the mechanism of division plane rotation in column formation , but they either analyzed small subsets of clonal doublets without tracking their contributions to columns or examined non-clonal doublets . In line with this idea , disruption of cell polarity , which leads to more incomplete division plane rotations , causes bone widening , whereas recent simulation of the growth plate predicted that lack of rotation during cell division causes the bone to expand in width . Our 3D analyses reveal the temporal dynamics of division plane rotations and their effect on the formation of columns and clusters in the
[METHODS] For genetic labeling of chondrocyte clones in embryonic and postnatal growth plates , Col2a1-CreER : R26R-Confetti heterozygous mice were generated by crossing mice homozygous for Col2-CreERT ( Jackson Laboratories , FVB-Tg ( Col2a1-cre/ERT ) KA3Smac/J ; Nakamura et al. , 2006 ) with R26R-Confetti homozygotes ( Jackson Laboratories , B6 . The proximal tibia and distal femur",,982,97,None,"Bones are made up of cells called chondrocytes , which are arranged in a row along the proximal-distal ( P-D ) axis . These cells are able to grow and divide at the same time , allowing the cells to move along the longitudinal axes of the bone . The growth plate is located at the ends of the P-S axi , and it is thought that this arrangement is a key factor in bone elongation . However , it is not clear how this arrangement works . To investigate this , Wang et al . used a technique called 3D imaging to study hundreds of cells in the growth plate of mice . This revealed that the cells were arranged on a plane that rotates during cell division . In the embryo , the cells stacked on the plane , while in the postnatal growth plate , they stacked . Interestingly , these cells did not have the same pattern of stacking , suggesting that they were not rotating . Wang also found that , although the cells had been arranged correctly , most of the cells in these cells were not stacked correctly . Thus , this suggests that cells are not arranged properly , but rather that they are stacked incorrectly . Furthermore , in the pre- and postnatal stages of bone development , cells tended to be stacked unevenly , with the cells being stacked evenly . Therefore , our findings suggest that cells arranged incorrectly in the division plane may be a part of a complex structure that regulates bone growth ."

[ABSTRACT] This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability . Our results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy ( ABFE ) calculations also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition , revealing key details underpining secondary active transport in POTs . By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate , we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access . Nevertheless , these studies leave open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling , while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations . Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters ( POTs ) are of great pharmaceutical interest owing to their promiscuous substrate binding site that has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs . These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs , which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays . Cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have recently provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs , SLC15A1 , and SLC15A2 . Here , we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces . Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient .
[INTRODUCTION] Several residues have been suggested to be involved in proton transfer , including a partially conserved histidine on TM2 ( H87 ; residue numbers refer to PepT2 , if not specified otherwise ) and two conserved glutamates on TM1 ( E53 and E56 ) , while simulations have helped our understanding of proton-transfer processes and conformational changes . Since the first structure of a POT family member was published , many procaryotic and plant homologues have been structurally and biochemically characterised , all in IF states with varying degrees of occlusion ( see Figure 1a for an overview of available POT structures and their conformational states ) . As for the intracellular gating mechanism , an involvement of the D170-K642 salt bridge has been suggested , and the OF structure shows close-packing of several hydrophobic residues ( F184 , Y183 , F187 , L630 , and Y634 ) that constrict access to the binding site from the intracellular side . Tri-peptides may adopt a similar orientation as di-peptides , or sit vertically in the transporter binding pocket , although it has been suggested that this vertical electron density could alternatively be explained by a bound HEPES molecule . In this study , we use extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD simulations ( totalling close to 1 ms of sampling ) to show how changes in protonation states of H87 and D342 control the OCC↔OF transition as an extracellular gate . From these structures emerges a picture where the intracellular gate is constituted by broad close-packing of hydrophobic residues on TM 4 , 5 , 10 , and 11 , with possible stabilisation from the conserved D170-K642 salt-bridge . Here , we work under the assumption of a 2:1 stoichiometry for neutral di-peptides , motivated also by our computational results that indicate distinct and additive roles played by two protons in the conformational cycle mechanism . We also elucidate the role of E53xxER glutamates and the substrate-engaging E622 in controlling the OCC↔IF transition , thereby identifying a clear molecular basis for the directionality of proton movement coupling to conformational changes . Understanding the processes by which small molecules cross membranes is of key pharmacological interest owing to their role
[RESULTS] Since , however , significant differences between replicates remained , we used principal component analysis ( PCA , see Materials and methods for details ) on the sampling collected of the standard protonation state transitions to derive sets of 2-dimensional CVs ( Figure 2-figure supplement 5 and Videos 1-4 ) that capture the main gate-opening motions in the first PC , and the direction along which the differing replicates can be best separated out as the second PC ( these correspond to cleft sliding and twisting motions ) . We found that the extracellular gate remains stably closed in triplicates of 1 μs-long MD when H87 or D342 are protonated individually , but the
[DISCUSSION] Taking together our 2D-PMFs and ABFE simulations , it is also clear that E622 , in addition to being essential for peptide recognition , plays two further roles : its protonation both facilitates substrate release and makes an additive contribution to the IF-directed bias exerted by the intracellular gate triggers ( whether E622 forms 'part ' of the intracellular gate remains then as a merely linguistic question ) . It would , therefore , not be meaningful to interpret the shape of a single PMF in this way ; only responses of the PMF to protonation-state or substrate-binding changes should be used to inform our view of the conformational cycle , since these are likely to benefit from error cancellation with respect to factors that act on the overall protein conformations ( which are conserved between the different conditions in which the PMFs were sampled ) . ]

This interaction is called proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter ( POT ) . POTs have been shown to be important for the development of drugs , but they are also important for other organs and tissues , such as the heart , liver , and kidneys . In mammals , the POT is made up of two proteins , one of which binds to a molecule called a salt . The salt is then transported to the surface of the cell by a pair of protons , known as a proton . When the peptide is taken into the cell it is bound to the salt , which is then released into the environment , where it can be used to make drugs . However , it is not clear how these two proteins interact with each other . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called molecular dynamics ( MD ) to study the structure of two mammalian POT proteins: SLC15A1 and SLC-15A2 . These proteins are found in the cytoplasm of the intestines , a part of the body that contains a protein called TM1 . They are also found in other tissues and organs – including the heart and liver – and are thought to be involved in the transport of a drug called acetylcholine . Wang "

[ABSTRACT] Further , we found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback , posterior STG was selectively activated if participants were engaged in a DAF paradigm , suggesting that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity . Importantly , there was a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity , suggesting suppression might be a key mechanism that underlies speech monitoring . This hypothesis has been previously confirmed in non-human primates , however a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring remains elusive . Next , we performed a delayed auditory feedback ( DAF ) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations . To address this issue , we obtained intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production . Across the animal kingdom , neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization , and humans are no exception . We first characterized the detailed topography of auditory suppression , which varied across superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) . A common hypothesis is that suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback , enabling the detection of vocalization errors . Indeed , overlapping sites showed enhanced responses to feedback , indicating sensitivity .
[INTRODUCTION] While auditory responses are largely suppressed during speech production , detailed investigations using neurosurgical recordings revealed that the degree of suppression was variable across cortical sites , and auditory cortex also exhibited non-suppressed and enhanced responses ( albeit less common ) , mirroring results from non-human primate studies using single-unit recordings . Our results revealed that overlapping sites in the superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) exhibited both speech-induced auditory suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback with a strong correlation between the two measures , supporting the hypothesis that auditory suppression predicts sensitivity to speech errors in humans . To address these aims , we used intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) recordings in neurosurgical participants , which offers a level of spatial detail and temporal precision that would not be possible to achieve using non-invasive techniques . Based on this finding , we predicted that if speech-induced suppression enables detection and correction of speech errors , suppressed auditory sites should be sensitive to auditory feedback , thus exhibit enhanced neural responses to feedback perturbations . We predicted that increased attention to auditory feedback under adverse speaking conditions , such as during an auditory feedback perturbation task , should increase feedback sensitivity and elicit larger responses in the auditory cortex compared to normal speech production . In support of speech production models , these studies have repeatedly reported suppressed responses in auditory cortex during speaking compared with passive listening to speech , as well as enhanced responses when auditory feedback was perturbed indicating sensitivity to auditory feedback . Auditory feedback perturbations are usually applied either by delaying auditory feedback ( DAF ) , which disrupts speech fluency , or by shifting voice pitch and formants , which result in compensatory vocal changes in the opposite direction of the shift . Further , we showed that auditory responses in the posterior STG are enhanced in a DAF task compared to normal speech production , even for trials in which participants receive simultaneous auditory feedback ( no-delay condition ) . Further , we aimed to investigate the role of attention in auditory feedback sensitivity by comparing auditory responses during an auditory feedback perturbation task compared with normal speech production . It is well known that selective attention enhances auditory responses and improves speech perception under noisy listening conditions
[RESULTS] Our neural analysis revealed that response magnitudes in auditory cortex were much larger when participants heard their simultaneous voice feedback in a DAF paradigm compared with producing speech without any feedback ( DAF0 : no-delay trials ) ( average % signal change in 0-500 ms ; DAF0 : 113±14 , VWR : 41±7 , compare gray lines in Figure 3A and C with black lines in Figure 3B and D , respectively ) . To ensure that our observed suppression of neural activity in auditory regions was not due to repetition suppression , but rather was induced by speech production , we performed a visual word reading ( VWR ) task , in which participants hear the auditory stimulus only
[DISCUSSION] While remaining cautious about this interpretation and our study 's limitation in attentional controls , we believe that this response enhancement represents an increased neural gain driven by attention to auditory feedback , and highlights the critical role of the posterior STG in auditory-motor integration during speech monitoring , with its close proximity to the human ventral attention network comprising temporoparietal junction . In our study , we found that neural responses in the posterior STG were larger for DAF0 ( randomly presented simultaneous feedback condition in the DAF task ) as compared with the VWR-AF condition ( consistent simultaneous feedback throughout standard word reading task ) , even though participants displayed similar vocal behavior in these two conditions . More recent EEG studies demonstrated that dividing attention between auditory feedback and additional visual stimuli or increasing the attentional load of the task affected vocal responses as well as the magnitude of ERP components , suggesting
[METHODS] The high gamma broadband response ( 70-150 Hz ) at each time point following stimulus onset was measured as the percent signal change from baseline , with the baseline calculated over all trials in a time window from -500 to -100 ms before stimulus onset ( data files containing high gamma activity recordings are available in GitHub ) .",,960,96,None,"The brains of animals and humans are able to detect and correct speech errors , which are often caused by a variety of factors . For example , if a person is speaking in a noisy environment , the brains in the auditory cortex of the brain are more sensitive to hearing noises . However , it is not clear whether this is the case in humans , or if it is a result of an increase in the amount of noise . The brain also has a role in detecting and correcting speech mistakes , but it is unclear whether this role is linked to the ability to detect speech errors in humans or other animals . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) to record the brain activity of 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production . This technique allowed Wang to examine the brain's response to noises and found that a number of areas in the brain were suppressed during speech . These areas were also more sensitive than normal , suggesting that the brain may be a key component of speech monitoring . Wang enlisted the help of a neurosurgery team to investigate the role of attention in speech sensitivity . Using this technique , they found that participants were more sensitive when they heard their voices being sounded . In addition , participants were less likely to hear their voices if they were sung with simultaneous voice feedback . Furthermore , when the participants were asked to produce a speech with simultaneous speech feedback , their brains responded more strongly to the feedback compared to normal . Overall , these findings suggest that if the brain is stimulated to produce speech , this could help to detect if speech errors are detected . Further research is needed to understand how the brain responds to"

[ABSTRACT] We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs , together with the ancillary restriction factors , employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems , in which an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first , but then , if it fails , an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over . All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components , such as OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein that binds bacterial transfer-messenger RNA ( tmRNA ) , YTH-like domains that might recognize methylated tmRNA , tRNA , or rRNA , and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs , along with RNases , such as HEPN domains , all suggesting that the CoCoNuTs target RNA . A comprehensive census of McrBC systems , among the most common forms of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems , followed by phylogenetic analysis , reveals their enormous abundance in diverse prokaryotes and a plethora of genomic associations . In many of these superoperons , CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides , possibly , RNA fragments with cyclic termini , that bind associated CARF ( CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold ) domains . We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch , which we denote coiled-coil nuclease tandems ( CoCoNuTs ) for their salient features : the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases . Additional restriction systems , such as Type I RM , BREX , and Druantia Type III , are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons . The CoCoNuTs alone show extraordinary variety , with three distinct types and multiple subtypes . Many CoCoNuTs might additionally target DNA , via McrC nuclease homologs .
[INTRODUCTION] These observations motivated us to conduct a comprehensive computational search for McrBC systems , followed by a census of all associated domains , to chart the vast and diverse population of antiviral specificity modules , vital for prokaryotic defense , that also provided important source material during the evolution of central signature features of eukaryotic cells . Historically , the two-component McrBC ( modified cytosine restriction ) system was the first form of restriction to be described , although the mechanism remained obscure for decades , and for a time , this system was referred to as RglB ( restriction of glucoseless phages ) due to its ability to restrict T-even phage DNA which contained hydroxymethylcytosine , but not glucosylated bases . Our recent analysis of the modified base-binding EVE ( named for Protein Data Bank PDB structural identifier 2eve ) domain superfamily demonstrated how the distribution of the EVE-like domains connects the elaborate eukaryotic RNA regulation and RNA interference-related epigenetic silencing pathways to largely uncharacterized prokaryotic antiphage restriction systems . Characterization of the most prominent of these systems , such as restriction-modification ( RM ) , RNA interference ( RNAi ) , and CRISPR-Cas ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated genes ) , has led to the development of a profusion of highly effective experimental and therapeutic techniques , in particular , genome editing and engineering . In particular , in the last few years , targeted searches for defense systems in prokaryotes , typically capitalizing on the presence of variable genomic defense islands , have dramatically expanded their known diversity and led to the discovery of a plethora of biological conflict strategies and mechanisms . EVE superfamily domains , which in eukaryotes recognize modified DNA or RNA as part of mRNA maturation or epigenetic silencing functions , are often fused to McrB-like GTPases in prokaryotes , and indeed , these are the most frequently occurring EVE-containing fusion proteins . Today , the prototypical McrBC system , native to Escherichia coil K-12 , is considered a Type IV ( modification-dependent ) restriction system that degrades DNA containing methylcytosine ( 5mC ) or hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5hmC ) , with a degree of sequence context specificity . McrC , encoded by a separate gene in the same operon , contains an N-terminal DUF2357 domain , which interacts with the GTPase domain in McrB and stimulates
[DISCUSSION] One of the two outcomes can result from this cascade : infection is either eradicated quickly by restriction of the virus DNA , which inhibits cOA signaling via the depletion of viral RNA , along with the activity of RING nucleases , thus averting PCD , or else , the continued presence of viral RNA stimulates cOA signaling until PCD or dormancy occurs , limiting the spread of viruses to neighboring cells in the bacterial population . Under this scenario , the virus is either destroyed by the activity of the DNA restriction systems , which would inhibit signal production ( likely RNA fragments with cyclic phosphate ends rather than cOA ) and drive down CoCoNuT transcription , thereby preventing PCD , or as the virus replicates , signaling and CoCoNuT transcription would continue until the infection is aborted by PCD or dormancy caused by the degradation of host mRNA by the HEPN RNase ( s ) of the CoCoNuT
[METHODS] The alignments of each cluster resulting from this protocol , which included some false-positive clusters consisting of other members of the AAA_5 family , were analyzed with HHpred to remove the false positives , after which the GTPase domain sequences were extracted manually using HHpred , and the alignments were used as queries for a second round of PSI-BLAST against the",,926,95,None,"Bacteria are able to evade a variety of threats , including viruses , bacteria , and other pathogens . In some cases , the bacterial genome can be modified in order to prevent the infection . However , it is not clear how these changes are carried out . For example , a bacterial bacterium called Druantia , which is a protozoan , has a system called McrBC that restricts the amount of cytosine in its DNA . This restriction system is known as Type IV restriction , but it has not been fully understood how it works . It is thought that , in eukaryotes , this restriction system was first described in the 1950s , when the two-component system was referred to as RglB .

These two types of restriction systems are similar to those of CRISPR-Cas systems , where the immune response eliminates virus DNA and/or RNA first , then if it fails , an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy takes over . Interestingly , many of these systems are likely to be regulated by cyclic nucleotides , possibly RNA fragments that bind associated CARF proteins , as well as RNases that may also recognize methylated tmRNA ,"

[ABSTRACT] Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity , we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ) in C. elegans . Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP , resulting in intestinal bloating , rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria , and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection . Finally , we show that the nuclear hormone receptor , NHR-8 , is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan . We demonstrate that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction , resulting in enhanced lifespan . Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the C. elegans DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension . Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through multiple signaling pathways . Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions . The TFEB ortholog , HLH-30 , is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition .
[INTRODUCTION] Calcineurin , a conserved protein from yeast to humans , is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is involved in diverse cellular processes and signal transduction pathways . Knockdown of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin , tax-6 , is known to enhance C. elegans lifespan via multiple pathways , including autophagy and CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators . The knockdown of tax-6 resulted in intestinal bloating due to defects in the DMP , which enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection by increasing gut colonization by bacteria . Indeed , the positive correlation between improved stress resistance and enhanced lifespan has been exploited to identify long-lived mutants . Because C. elegans lacks the NFAT transcription factors , it will be intriguing to study how calcineurin inhibition impacts C. elegans innate immunity . Moreover , we found that the nuclear hormone receptor , NHR-8 , is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for increased lifespan . Moreover , the genetic pathways for lifespan and immunity could be uncoupled in mutants exhibiting enhanced lifespan and improved immune responses . Surprisingly , we found that the knockdown of tax-6 enhanced the susceptibility of C. elegans to bacterial infection despite enhancing lifespan . Intestinal bloating resulted in calorie restriction-like phenotypes , including reduced lipid levels , and led to increased lifespan . However , the role of calcineurin in regulating C. elegans response to pathogen infections has not been studied . We discovered that the TFEB ortholog , HLH-30 , is required for calcineurin inhibition-mediated lifespan extension . Dephosphorylation of NFATs by calcineurin triggers their nuclear localization and activates immune responses in vertebrates . These studies could also shed some light on the complex interplay between lifespan and immunity . Therefore , the relationship between lifespan and innate immunity appears to be complex and remains to be fully understood . Dephosphorylation of substrate proteins by calcineurin affects several cellular pathways , including transcriptional signaling programs . In this study , we examined the effect of calcineurin inhibition on C. elegans innate immunity . Conversely , mutants with enhanced lifespans but declined immune responses have also been discovered . We discovered that tax-6 is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ) . Among stress responses , innate immunity appears to be a crucial factor for enhanced lifespan . Calcineurin regulates the activity of the transcription factors of the nuclear factor of activated T
[RESULTS] These findings suggested that the reduced survival on P. aeruginosa following calcineurin inhibition is independent of HLH-30 and NHR-8 and is more likely due to increased gut colonization by P. aeruginosa resulting from DMP defects ( Figure 6C ) . We then explored whether the increased susceptibility to bacterial infection following tax-6 knockdown was mediated by any known C. elegans innate immunity pathways , including the MAP kinase pathway mediated by NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1 , the MLK-1/MEK-1/KGB-1 c-Jun kinase pathway , the TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway , and the bZIP transcription factor ZIP-2 pathway . Specifically , we analyzed the interactions of the AMP-activated kinase , aak-2 , the mTOR pathway , raga-1 , ribosomal S6 kinase , rsks-1 , the FOXO transcription factor , daf-16 , and
[DISCUSSION] Several C. elegans mutants with defects in the DMP and bloated intestinal lumens are known to have dampened nutrient absorption , leading to reduced lipid deposition in the gut , mimicking calorie restriction . It remains to be studied whether NHR-8 and HLH-30 work in the same or different pathways downstream of calcineurin inhibition ( Figure 6C ) . We found that tax-6 knockdown enhanced lifespan independent of multiple dietary restriction pathways , including raga-1 , rsks-1 , daf-16 , and nhr-49 . The complete characterization of the physiological changes downstream of gut bloating may provide broad insights into the effects of gut physiology on behaviors , immunity , and lifespan . Recent studies in different organisms have shown that gut bloating has profound effects on food-seeking behaviors , immunity , and lifespan . Therefore , it is likely that reduced lipid levels because of intestinal bloating result in the activation of autophagy upon calcineurin inhibition . We identified that tax-6

Serial dilutions of the lysates ( 101 , 102 , 103 , 104 ) were seeded onto LB plates containing 50 μg/mL of kanamycin to",,948,96,None,"The ability of a living organism to survive and thrive in a stressful environment is crucial for survival . In order to survive , the organism must be able to survive without the help of other organisms . This is achieved by a process called the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ) . The DMP is a system of cellular processes that regulates the activity of several genes , including a protein called calcineurin , which is found in yeast and humans . DMPs are also important for preventing bacteria from infecting the body . However , it is not clear how DMP functions in C . elegans , or how it affects the ability of the organism to live .

[ABSTRACT] Both human performance and fMRI activity patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex support that different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity , thus suggesting cognitive space as a principle for representing conflicts . Based on the cognitive space theory , different conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a ( low-dimensional ) cognitive space , which can then be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes working along the dimensions . As conflicts can arise from different sources ( e. g. , sensory input , internal representations ) , how a limited set of cognitive control processes can effectively address diverse conflicts remains a major challenge . It leads to a hypothesis that conflicts similar in their sources are also represented similarly in the cognitive space . Cognitive control resolves conflicts between task-relevant and -irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior . We designed a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized .
[INTRODUCTION] Even within the same brain area ( e. g. , medial frontal cortex ) , Fu et al. , 2022 found that the neural population activity can be factorized into orthogonal dimensions encoding both domain-general and domain-specific conflict information , which can be selectively read out by downstream brain regions . Our recent work showed that it is possible to manipulate continuous conflict similarity by using a mixture of two independent conflict types with varying ratios , which can be used to further examine the behavioral and neural evidence for the cognitive space view . Our data from two experiments using this experimental design support both predictions : using behavioral data , we found that the influence of congruency ( i. e. , whether the task-relevant and task-irrelevant information indicate the same response ) from the previous trial to the next trial increases with the conflict similarity between the two trials . For instance , Freitas and Clark , 2015 found that trial-by-trial adjustment of control can generalize across two conflict domains to different degrees , leading to domain-general ( strong generalization ) or domain-specific ( weak or no generalization ) conclusions depending on the task settings of the consecutive conflicts . However , since domain-general processes are by definition likely shared by different tasks , when we need to handle multiple task demands at the same time , the efficiency of both tasks would be impaired due to resource competition or interference . For example , Fu et al. , 2022 mapped different conflict conditions to locations in a low-/high-dimensional cognitive space to demonstrate the domain-general/domain-specific problems ; Grahek et al. , 2022 used a cognitive space model of cognitive control settings to explain behavioral changes in the speed-accuracy tradeoff . It is also unclear how the cognitive space of cognitive control is encoded in the brain , although that of spatial locations and non-spatial abstract knowledge has been relatively well investigated in the medial temporal lobe , medial prefrontal , and orbitofrontal system . While the mixture view provides an explanation for the contradictory findings , it suffers the same criticism as domain-specific cognitive control theories as it still requires many cognitive control processes to fully cover all possible conflicts . In this study , we adjusted the paradigm from our previous study by including transitions of trials from five different conflict types , which enabled us to test
[RESULTS] To test this prediction , we computed the representational similarity matrix ( RSM ) that encoded correlations of blood-oxygen-level dependent ( BOLD ) signal patterns between each pair of conflict type ( Stroop , StHSmL , StMSmM , StLSmH , and Simon , with H , M , and L indicating high , medium , and low , respectively , see also Figure 1B ) × congruency ( congruent , incongruent ) × arrow direction ( up , down ) × run × subject combinations for each of the 360 cortical regions from the multi-modal parcellation ( MMP ) cortical atlas . To explore the relation between conflict type and orientation representations , we conducted representational connectivity ( i. e. , the similarity between two
[DISCUSSION] This finding suggests that different cognitive control states may be encoded in an abstract cognitive space , which reconciles the long-standing debate between the domain-general and domain-specific views of cognitive control and provides a parsimonious and more broadly applicable framework for understanding how our brains efficiently and flexibly represents multiple task settings . A possible improvement to our current design would be to include left , right , up , and down arrows represented in a grid formation across four spatially separate quadrants , with each arrow mapped to its own response button . However , since this paradigm is a two-alternative forced choice design , the behavioral CSE is not a pure measure of adjusted control but could be partly confounded by bottom-up factors such as feature integration . However , this appears unlikely as it would imply that our manipulation of conflict types merely represented varying levels of a single conflict , akin to manipulating task difficulty when everything else
[METHODS] Importantly , conflict similarity was based on how Simon and spatial Stroop conflicts are combined and hence was calculated by first rotating all subject 's stimulus location to the top-right and bottom-left quadrants , whereas orientation was calculated using original stimulus locations . GLM1 aimed to validate the design of our study by replicating the engagement of frontoparietal activities in conflict processing",,943,96,None,"The brain is made up of a number of different regions , including the frontal cortex , the medial temporal lobe , and the orbitofrontal cortex ( a part of the brain called the dorsolateral prefrontal ) . These regions are known as the “brain regions” , which are responsible for determining which areas of the body are affected by a particular conflict . The brain region that controls the activity of the fMRI brain region is known as a “computational space” . In the brain , there are five types of conflict , each of which can be represented as distinct points in a low-dimensional space . For example , if a conflict is related to a sensory input , it can be referred to as the conflict type . However , this is not always the case , because the conflict types can arise from different sources , such as sensory input and internal representations . To address this problem , researchers have developed a task with five different types of conflicts . Using a computer simulation , Wang et al . used a technique called a combination of brain regions to study how the brain is organized . This revealed that the brain area that controls a single conflict type can be divided into five different regions that can be controlled by varying amounts of cognitive control . Wang , Zhao ed . also showed that the differences between the two conflict types could be explained by the presence of similar brain regions . Thus , these findings suggest that a limited set of cognitive controls can be used to resolve a variety of conflict types . It is also possible to use this approach to study the brain regions that are involved in resolving conflict types in the future ."

[ABSTRACT] This research was conducted by the Perinatology Research Branch , Division of Obstetrics and Maternal-Fetal Medicine , Division of Intramural Research , Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , National Institutes of Health , U. S. Department of Health and Human Services ( NICHD/NIH/DHHS ) under contract HHSN275201300006C . Thus , we conducted the largest longitudinal investigation targeting vaginal immune mediators , referred to herein as the immunoproteome , in a population at high risk for sPTB . The prediction of spontaneous preterm birth ( sPTB ) remains underpowered due to its syndromic nature and the dearth of independent analyses of the vaginal host immune response . Furthermore , the vaginal immunoproteome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early sPTB , a subset of sPTB associated with extremely adverse neonatal outcomes . Such an inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants , cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation , and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides . The vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk for early ( < 34 weeks ) sPTB . Yet , the vaginal immunoproteome is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory state in pregnant women who ultimately experience sPTL and PPROM . Vaginal swabs were collected across gestation from pregnant women who ultimately underwent term birth , sPTL , or PPROM . Most cases of preterm birth occur spontaneously and result from preterm labor with intact ( spontaneous preterm labor [ sPTL ] ) or ruptured ( preterm prelabor rupture of membranes [ PPROM ] ) membranes . The vaginal immunoproteome undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations from this shift are associated with sPTB . Cytokines , chemokines , growth factors , and antimicrobial peptides in the samples were quantified via specific and sensitive immunoassays . ALT , KRT , and NGL were supported by the Wayne State University Perinatal Initiative in Maternal , Perinatal and Child Health . Throughout uncomplicated gestation , the vaginal immunoproteome harbors a cytokine network with a homeostatic profile . Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide . Predictive models were constructed from immune mediator concentrations .
[INTRODUCTION] Yet , to date , assessment of cervical length remains the strongest and most cost-effective predictor of sPTB : women with a sonographic short cervix ( ≤ 25 mm ) are sixfold more likely to deliver a preterm neonate , and tailored treatment with natural progesterone reduces such risk by half . Two-thirds of preterm births occur spontaneously ( i. e. , spontaneous preterm birth [ sPTB ] ) , while the remainder are due to evident clinical conditions ( e. g. , preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction ) that jeopardize maternal-fetal well-being and require medically indicated delivery ( i. e. , iatrogenic preterm birth ) . Importantly , our determinations were performed in vaginal samples collected during all three trimesters and considered sPTB , including its two subsets ( i. e. , sPTL and PPROM ) , as well as the timing of delivery ( i. e. , early and late sPTB ) . Indeed , personalized cervical length assessment that accounts for maternal characteristics and obstetrical history was shown to improve prediction relative to raw cervical length data ; however , additional biomarkers are still needed to further increase prediction performance . However , models utilizing vaginal microbiome data alone have displayed weak predictive power , potentially due to sample size , sequencing depth , and ethnicity-driven differences in microbial community profile . The pathogenesis of sPTL and PPROM can include local inflammatory processes ; yet , each is considered a syndrome with distinct underlying mechanisms of disease and thus requiring different clinical managements . Herein , we conducted the largest assessment , based on the study 's scale , longitudinal nature , and depth of immunological mediators evaluated , of the vaginal immunoproteome during uncomplicated and complicated pregnancies . Nonetheless , an extensive interrogation of the vaginal soluble immune response ( i. e. , the vaginal immunoproteome ) , with consideration of the distinction between sPTL and PPROM cases , has not been undertaken . Multiple attempts have been made to predict sPTB using data from noninvasive sampling coupled with omics platforms such as genomics , transcriptomics , and proteomics . Additionally , we used machine learning approaches and cross-validation to generate and assess predictive models for sPTL and PPROM in our high-risk population . Recent models
[RESULTS] Given that the immunobiology of preterm birth is syndromic in nature , in this study we classified the immune mediators measured in the vaginal fluid into six categories based on their established role and/or their potential cellular source : pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 , IL-1β , IL-16 , CXCL8 , TNF , IFN-γ , IL-1α , and LT-α ) , chemoattractants of monocytes ( herein referred to as monocyte chemokines ; CCL2 , CCL3 , and CCL4 ) , macrophage cytokines ( IL-12/IL-23p40 , IL-12p70 , and IL-15 ) , T-cell cytokines and chemokines ( IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-17A , IL-10 , IL-13 , IL-5 , CXCL10 , and CCL17 ) , antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ;

Differences between cases and controls were assessed using linear mixed effects models with adjustment for gestational age at sampling , maternal",,945,86,Missing discussion section,"Preterm birth is the most common cause of premature birth in the United States , and it is the leading cause of death in the world . However , it is not clear how the immune system responds to preterm birth . The vaginal immune system is made up of a large number of molecules , including cytokines , chemokines and growth factors . These molecules are found in the vagina , but they are also found in other parts of the body , such as the cervix , which is a part of the uterus . During pregnancy , many women develop a condition called preterm labor . This is referred to as spontaneous birth , or spontaneous preterm contraction . In this case , the vaginus is surrounded by a layer of cells called the immunoproteome . It is thought that this layer is responsible for the immune response to the vagus . But , there is no evidence that this is the case for spontaneous birth in pregnant women . To investigate this question , Wong et al . collected samples from pregnant women who underwent a period of gestation that included a total of 34 weeks of pregnancy . They collected the samples from women who had been pregnant for at least three weeks , with the results of the study published in the journal Perinatology . We found that , in women who were pregnant for more than three weeks and who had a vagina that was swollen or ruptured , these samples were more likely to have spontaneous pre-term birth than those who were not .

[ABSTRACT] Here , we describe an in silico model , which we call the 'Hernandez-Hernandez model ' , of electrical and Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes based on new experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries . We also show that in an idealized computational model of a vessel , female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca2+ channel blockers compared to male . Over the physiological range of membrane potentials , the gating of a small number of voltage-gated K+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels are predicted to drive sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and excitability . The model suggests the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial blood vessels . The function of the smooth muscle cells lining the walls of mammalian systemic arteries and arterioles is to regulate the diameter of the vessels to control blood flow and blood pressure . 1 channel expression and longer time constants for activation than male myocytes , predictions from simulated female myocytes suggest that KV2 . 5 channel currents have similar amplitudes , kinetics , and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes , simulations suggest that the KV1 . In summary , we present a new model framework to investigate the potential sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs . 1 plays a primary role in the control of membrane potential . 5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes . In female cells , which have larger KV2 . Although experimental data suggest that KV1 .
[INTRODUCTION] Previous mathematical models of vascular smooth muscle myocytes generated to describe the membrane potential and Ca2+ signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells have described the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) by endogenous or pharmacological vasoactive agents activating inositol 1 , 4 , 5-trisphosphate ( IP3 ) and ryanodine ( RyR ) receptors , resulting in the initiation of calcium waves . Based on work largely done using cerebral arterial smooth muscle , a model has been proposed in which this myogenic response is initiated when membrane stretch activates Na+-permeable canonical TRPC6 and melastatin-type TRPM4 . Together , these studies point to an elaborate multiprotein complex that plays a critical role in sensing pressure and initiating the myogenic response by inducing membrane depolarization and activating voltage-gated , dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type CaV1 . In a major step forward , the Karlin model incorporated new cell structure data and electrophysiology experimental data in a computational model that predicted the essential behavior of membrane potential and Ca2+ signaling arising from intracellular domains found in arterial myocytes . BKCa channels are organized into clusters along the sarcolemma of arterial myocytes and are activated by Ca2+ sparks resulting from the simultaneous opening of ryanodine receptors type 2 ( RyR2 ) located in a specialized junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) . A recent study in smooth muscle from mesenteric arteries identified two additional TRP channels to the chain of events that link increases in intravascular pressure to arterial myocyte depolarization : TRPP1 ( PKD1 ) and TRPP2 ( PKD2 ) channels . Because the input resistance of arterial myocytes is high ( about 2-10 GΩ ) , even relatively small currents ( 10-30 pA ) produced by the activation of a small cluster of 6-12 BKCa channels by a Ca2+ spark can transiently hyperpolarize the membrane potential of these cells by 10-30 mV . It is worth noting that this computational framework can be expanded to predict the consequences of antihypertensive drugs and other perturbations , transitioning seamlessly from single-cell to tissue-level simulations . Here , we describe a new model , which we call the 'Hernandez-Hernandez model ' , of mesenteric smooth muscle myocytes that incorporates new electrophysiological and Ca2+ signaling
[RESULTS] In addition , we also included models for leak currents of ion i calculated as ( 10 ) Ii , b=Gi , b ( V−Ei ) where the Nernst potential of ion i with valance zi is given by ( 11 ) Ei=RT/ziFln ( [ i ] out/ [ i ] in ) , i=Na+ , K+andCa2+ where R is the gas constant , F is the Faraday 's constant , T is the temperature , and [ i ] out denotes the extracellular concentration of ion i . The mathematical formulation of the BKCa with αβ1 current ( IBKαβ1 ) was optimized to fit the experimental whole-cell electrophysiological data from Bao and Cox
[DISCUSSION] The model presented here describes the necessary and sufficient ion channels , pumps , and transporters to describe the electrical activity and Ca2+ signaling of an isolated mesenteric smooth muscle cell in the absence of complex signaling pathways . Although mouse arteries do present numerous parallels with human arteries , including analogous intravascular pressure-myogenic tone relationships , resting membrane potentials , and the expression of typical ionic channels like CaV1 . Excitation-contraction coupling refers to an electrical stimulus that drives the release of calcium from the SR and results in the physical translocation of fibers that underlie muscle contraction . In doing so , we predicted that very few channels are needed to contribute to and sustain the oscillatory behavior of the membrane potential and calcium signaling . Such an approach enabled us to perform a component dissection to analyze the sex-specific differences observed in the fundamental electrophysiology
[METHODS] Here , the open probability Po of each voltage-dependent gating variable 'n ' was defined by opening- and closing-rate voltage-dependent functions αn and βn , respectively , and was modeled by simple exponentials of the form : ( 29 ) αn ( V ) =x1e ( Vx2 ) ( 30 ) βn ( V ) =x3e",,985,98,None,"Blood pressure is a measure of how much blood flows through the body . This pressure is measured by the amount of water in the blood , which is called blood pressure . The blood pressure is controlled by a complex system of molecules called channels , known as membranes . These channels are made up of proteins called BKCa and L-type Ca2+ channels . When the membranes are stretched , these channels release a chemical called calcium ions into the bloodstream . Calcium ions are then absorbed by the cells , causing the blood pressure to increase . However , it is not clear how these channels work . To investigate this question , Wang et al . created a new computational model of the activity of these channels in blood vessels . In the model , the molecules that are present in the membrane are divided into two groups , called K+ and L+ . One group is called KV1 , and the other group is known as KV2 . 5 . Both groups of channels have different amplitudes and kinetics , but the KV 1 channel is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male and female cells . Although the model is based on experimental data from mice , Zhang , Wei , Chen ed . have now developed a computational model that can be used to predict the effects of antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure in the human body , including the effect of a drug on blood flow . It is also possible to use this model to study the effects on the blood flow in the brain , as well as the effect on the heart ."

[ABSTRACT] We tested this hypothesis by placing plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient , and by characterizing the macro-decomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping . Our findings highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands , possibly resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum , and emphasizing the need to contemplate decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes . We hypothesized that higher tolerance of macro-decomposers to aridity may counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers , leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients . Litter decomposition is expected to be positively associated with precipitation despite evidence that decomposers of varying sizes have different moisture dependencies . Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer . This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyper-arid sites . We found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size . Macro-decomposer richness , abundance , and biomass peaked in arid environments .
[INTRODUCTION] We also predicted that the opposing climatic dependencies of macrofauna and microorganisms and mesofauna should lead to similar overall decomposition rates across the precipitation gradient except in the hyper-arid sites in which decomposers activity is predicted to be minimal regardless of organism size ( Figure 1 ) . To test this novel hypothesis , we examined the climate dependency of plant litter decomposition by microorganisms , meso-decomposers , and macro-decomposers along a sharp aridity gradient spanning from mean annual precipitation ( MAP ) of 22-526 mm . This global pattern , however , may be confounded by compiling the effect of all decomposer fauna together , ignoring the well-established understanding that soil animals of various size groups respond differently to climate . Moreover , their large size enables them to remain active during long dry periods by shuttling between existing and self-engineered climatic havens and the hostile foraging grounds on the surface . Detritivorous animals are expected to be exceptionally abundant in arid ecosystems where plant detritus is prevalent year-round but green plant material is available predominantly in short pulses following precipitation events . Thus , understanding how climate and decomposers interact is a key step in explaining variation in plant litter decomposition across ecosystems and seasons , and in forecasting the consequences of climate change and biodiversity loss on elemental cycling . We hypothesized that both microbial and mesofaunal decomposition should increase with increasing precipitation during the winter , but during the dry summer contribute only minimally to plant litter decomposition across the aridity gradient . Cross-site studies , reviews , and meta-analyses verified this global pattern , showing that plant litter decomposition in microbial litter bags is indeed faster under warm and wet conditions than under cool and dry conditions . This suggests that the conceptualization of how animals and climate interact to regulate decomposition rates requires considering the effects of meso-decomposers and those of macro-decomposers separately , particularly in warm drylands . This well accepted realization implicitly assumes that microorganisms dominate plant litter decomposition , largely ignoring the growing recognition that animals may play an important role in litter cycling . In the dry summer , macrofaunal decomposition should follow a hump-shaped response to precipitation , increasing from hyper-arid to arid sites and decreasing gradually in more mesic semiarid and Mediterranean sites . In these environments , the extreme climatic conditions and scarce and unpredictable plant litter
[RESULTS] There were parallels between the spatial and temporal axes of aridity , as winter communities in the most arid sites ( Nahal Shita , Meishar , and Avdat ) were relatively similar to the summer communities of the more mesic sites ( Sayeret Shaked , Havat Shikmim , and Bet Guvrin ) ( Figure 6A , B ; Supplementary file 2 ) . Within site and season comparisons between mesh sizes yielded significant differences only in Avdat , Sayeret Shaked , and Havat Shikmim , indicating that faunal effects on decomposition were found only under arid to dry-semiarid conditions ( Figure 3 ) . The Ramat Hanadiv assemblage was distinctively different from all other sites ( Figure 6A ) , as demonstrated by very
[DISCUSSION] We , in turn , hypothesized that the opposing climatic dependencies of macrofauna and that of microorganisms and mesofauna should lead to similar overall decomposition rates across precipitation gradients , except in hyper-arid environments in which decomposers activity is predicted to be minimal regardless of organism size . The puzzle of why plant litter decomposition in arid-lands is decoupled from annual precipitation and is faster than expected based on microbial decomposition models has bothered scientists for half a century , and was later termed the dryland decomposition conundrum . This discrepancy may reflect underestimation of faunal decomposition rates in drylands , possibly because these studies either deliberately grouped cold and dry environments together , or focused solely on precipitation without accounting for differences in temperature . We , however , hypothesized that climate dependencies of mesofauna and macrofauna should differ due to the lower sensitivity of macrofauna to high temperature and low moisture , and the ability of macro-decomposers to shuttle between
[METHODS] To explore which macro-decomposer groups dominate the different sites and seasons , we classified the identified morphospecies to ten macro-decomposer taxa : Archaeognatha ( bristletails ) , Coleoptera ( beetles ) , Diplopoda ( millipedes ) , Formicidae ( ants ) , Gastropoda ( snails and slugs ) , Grylloidea ( crickets ) , Isoptera ( termites ) , Lumbricina (",,941,95,None,"Plant litter is a major source of waste in the environment , and it can be a problem for many animals , including humans , to recycle their waste . However , it is not clear how these animals are able to decompose , or how they respond to changes in climate . For example , if the environment is dry , the plants in the soil may be unable to absorb the waste , which can lead to disease . This is because the soil is prone to a variety of environmental conditions , such as droughts , floods and storms . In arid environments , plant litter can be collected by microorganisms and microbes – both of which are found on the surface of the soil . These organisms have a large number of different sizes , but they can also be found in the same environment . To understand how these different types of organisms respond to different environmental conditions in a particular environment - such as a desert , desert or a tropical rainforest - researchers need to understand how they interact with each other . The first step in this process is to determine how the different types and sizes of the organisms interact . Using a technique called pitfall trapping , Wang et al . used a series of different materials to study the effects of a wide range of different species of plant litter . They found that the microbial and meso-decomposers responded differently to the different levels of precipitation , while the macrofaunal decomposition was more active in the dry summer , suggesting that the larger the decomposed organisms remained active during the dry season .

[ABSTRACT] Deletion of Cyrib ( the gene encoding CYRI-B protein ) accelerates tumourigenesis , leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions , indicating a potential role as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation in early stages . Overall , we implicate CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer , providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis . CYRI-B depleted tumour cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid , a major driver of tumour spread , due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 . Hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all tumours drives RAC1 activation , conferring enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropinocytosis . Macropinocytosis is well understood as a nutrient scavenging mechanism , but little is known about its functions in trafficking of signalling receptors . We find that CYRI-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carries a dismal prognosis , with high rates of metastasis and few treatment options . However , as disease progresses , loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis .
[INTRODUCTION] Recently , the CYRI-B protein ( Cyfip-related RAC1-interacting protein B , formerly known as Fam49-B ) was discovered to interact with RAC1 and enhance leading edge actin dynamics by negatively regulating activation of the Scar/WAVE complex . PanINs arise from acinar cells that undergo acinar to ductal metaplasia changes and as mutations accrue , PanINs progress to full PDAC in which angiogenesis , infiltration of stromal cells , and invasion of the basement membrane occur as tumours progress . Additionally , coordinated RAC1 activation and deactivation are important in macropinocytosis , an actin-driven process whereby cells engulf extracellular substances via large cup-shaped protrusions of the plasma membrane . Cytoskeletal and migration-associated proteins have been associated with aggression and metastasis in PDAC both in human patient transcriptomes and in the KPC mouse model , suggesting avenues to pursue against metastatic spread . Tumours are frequently starved for amino acids and other nutrients and macropinocytosis is a major way for PDAC tumours to take up proteins , lipids , and cell debris from their environment . Metastasis is a complex process , involving cells breaching through tissue barriers , migrating and settling in distant sites in the body such as the liver , lungs , and peritoneal cavity . Metastasis is a complex process and the current gold standard mouse model of metastatic PDAC - the KPC ( KRASG12D , p53R172H , Pdx-1-Cre ) recapitulates multiple features of the human disease . Chemotaxis is thought to be a key driver of metastasis and pancreatic cancer cells migrate towards lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) both in vitro and in vivo , contributing to metastasis . LPA is a serum-derived chemotactic factor and was previously found to be consumed by melanoma and PDAC cells creating self-generated gradients contributing to metastasis . PDAC is thought to arise from precancerous non-invasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms ( PanINs ) classified as PanIN1-3 depending on the molecular and histological characteristics . This led to the conclusion that dysregulation of RAC1 control of epithelial polarity by active KRAS drives acinar to ductal metaplasia and accelerates tumourigenesis . Our study highlights CYRI-B as a potentially interesting new target in PDAC progression and metastasis and further elucidates the molecular mechanisms underpinning metastatic spread . These roles , along with the previous implication of RAC1 signalling in early and later stages of PDAC , suggested potential involvement
[RESULTS] Initial work showed that CKPC-1 cells expressing either GFP or CYRI-B-p17-GFP following stable transfection did not alter mRNA levels of LPAR1 or LPAR3 ( Figure 8-figure supplement 1A ) , suggesting that changes in the chemotactic ability of the cells is not likely due to alterations in the expression level of the LPARs . Live-cell imaging of AsPC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells transfected with CYRI-B-p17-GFP and mScarlet-Lck , a marker of the plasma membrane , showed that CYRI-B and Lck co-localised at the finger-like protrusions , cups , and internalised vesicles , confirming the localisation of CYRI-B on macropinosomes ( Figure 7B , Figure 6-figure supplement 1 , and Figure 6-video 2 ) . Pancreatic samples from KPC or CKPC mice revealed
[DISCUSSION] Our previous cell biology studies highlighted a role for CYRI-B as a buffer of RAC1-mediated actin assembly in lamellipodia and macropinocytic cups , but did not address the potential role that CYRI-B could play in tumourigenesis and metastasis , given its central role as a regulator of motility . Deletion of Cyrib in the pancreas , in concert with expression of KRAS G12D and p53 R172H , led to acceleration of PanIN formation and an increase in the area of pancreas showing lesions with high phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK , two crucial downstream targets of KRAS and RAC1 that drive proliferation and expansion . Having a buffer for RAC1 activity could provide advantages for tumours , where mutations in KRAS will drive high activation of RAC1 , which might be detrimental to cell survival due to enhanced reactive oxygen species production and enhanced downstream signalling . Taken together , CYRI-B may have potential as a biomarker and driver of early

It is caused by a mutation in a gene called KRAS , which is found in the cells of the pancreas . The cancer cells in this type of cancer are able to move around the body , causing them to spread . However , it is not clear how the cells in these cells move around . In some cases , the tumours can spread to other parts of the body such as the liver and lungs , where they can cause cancer . This means that the cancer cells are unable to move , and the tumour cells can only move to other areas . One of the key factors in this process is lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) . LPA is an essential nutrient for the cells to move to , but it has been shown that it can also be used as a chemotherapeutic agent . A protein called CYRI-B , also known as RAC1 , is found on the surface of the cells that help them move . CYR1 is found inside the cells and helps them to move towards the cytoplasm , making it easier for them to reach the lungs and intestines , as well as the skin . To study the role of CYRISB in the development of pancreatic cancer , Weiss et al . used a mouse model of a type of melanoma , called ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) to study how the cell moves to a new location in the body and how it responds to LPA in the process . These experiments show that CYRNA-B is highly expressed in PDAC cells , suggesting that it may be a key factor in"

[ABSTRACT] 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between env and the 3′ long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K ( HML-8 ) -related virus . HERV-K ( HML-2 ) , the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses ( HERVs ) , includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses , but no replication competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans . We show that the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element ( CTE ) , indicating the ancestral Rec-RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism . Age estimates , intact open reading frames , and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques . The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3 , which disrupt the Rec Response Element ( RcRE ) , required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA . HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates , including rhesus macaques , but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear . This clade is found in Old World monkeys ( OWM ) , but not great apes , suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split . We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons ; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade , suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons . We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques , including a clade of young , rhesus-specific insertions .
[INTRODUCTION] No replication competent human ERV ( HERV ) has been identified ; however , the betaretrovirus-like HERV-K group contains one subgroup , human MMTV-like-2 , or HML-2 ( named for its similarity to mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) ) , which includes many proviruses with full-length open reading frames ( ORFs ) and other intact functional elements , including two proviruses with full-length ORFs for the four core retroviral proteins Gag , Pro , Pol , and Env . In order to investigate the possibility that HML-2 viruses were recently or are currently active in rhesus macaques , we searched for HML-2 proviral sequences in the two most recent rhesus genome assemblies and performed an in-depth characterization of their structure , coding capacity , and evolutionary history , with a particular focus on SERV-K1-like proviruses . These sequences serve as a useful 'fossil record ' of past viral infections , and can also play important roles in genome evolution , host-viral interactions , and disease ; in some animals , such as mice and cats , reactivation and recombination of ERVs with exogenous viruses and/or other ERVs can have severe pathogenic consequences . A recent study reported that HML-2 has more recently been actively replicating in gorillas than in humans , though it is still unclear whether that activity has continued to the present day ; some chimpanzee-specific insertions have also been identified , although fewer than in humans or gorillas . Both of these characteristics indicate that SERV-K1 is a relatively young insertion ( less than about 500 , 000 years old ) , and suggests that rhesus macaques could possibly harbor currently or recently active HML-2-like retroviruses . The majority of HML-2 proviruses containing full-length ORFs are within the LTR5Hs subclade , which is the youngest HERV clade and contains many human specific and insertionally polymorphic proviruses that have not yet reached fixation in human populations . If an infected cell survives , the integrated viral genome , or provirus , will be stably inherited by daughter cells ; if a germline cell is infected , the provirus may be inherited by an offspring of the host organism as a heterozygous allele , which may eventually become fixed
[RESULTS] As younger proviral insertions are likely to be insertionally polymorphic , we screened 23 of the rhesus SERV-K/MER11 proviruses for insertional polymorphism in a panel of 14 rhesus macaque genomic DNA samples using 3 primer allele-specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with insertion specific flanking primers and a primer specific to the SERV-K/MER11 5′ UTR to amplify the proviral allele and/or the pre-integration empty site ; two crab-eating macaque ( Macaca fascicularis ) samples were also screened ( Figure 3-figure supplement 1 ) . Interestingly , one provirus with discordantly clustering LTRs , 10_73510506-gib , appears to be the result of an inter or intrachromosomal recombination between two proviruses , resulting in a chromosomal translocation
[DISCUSSION] Rhesus macaques are a well-characterized model organism for human disease ; if these viruses are still actively replicating in macaques or other OWM species , they could provide an opportunity to observe the infection dynamics of an HML-2-like virus in a natural host , which could provide insights on currently incompletely understood aspects of HML-2 biology , such as tropism , pathogenic potential , receptor usage , and mode of transmission . Lastly , we have demonstrated that SERV-K/MER11 contains a novel CTE ; this provides a fascinating opportunity to investigate the evolution of a retrovirus as it shifted from using a Rev/RRE-type system to a CTE-type system , and to observe how two closely related viruses that use very different RNA trafficking mechanisms differ in their replication dynamics . We were unable to estimate integration times for most of the gibbon proviruses because their 5′ and 3′ LTRs had
[METHODS] To identify SERV-K-like proviruses in other primates we used BLAT searches against genome assemblies for crab-eating macaque ( macFas5 ) , Anubis baboon ( papAnu4 ) , African green monkey ( chlSab2 ) , GSM ( rhiRox1 ) , human ( hg38/GRCh38 ) , chimpanzee ( panTro6 ) , gorilla ( gorGor5 ) , orangutan ( ponAbe3",,980,97,None,"Many viruses , including viruses that cause cancer and other diseases , can be transmitted to other animals , such as humans . However , it is not clear how these viruses are transmitted to humans , or how they are transmitted . The most common type of virus transmitted by humans is the human endogenous retrovirus ( HERV ) , which is found in many animals . HERR-K ( HML-2 ) is the youngest group of human endogenic retroviruses , but it has been identified in other primates , like rhesus macaques . In addition , there are a number of other viruses that have recently been found in humans and other animals—including gibbons—and some of these viruses have been linked to a new virus called HML-8 . It is not known whether HML-4 is still present in humans or if it is still active in other animals in the future . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called X-ray crystallography to look at the genomes of 145 HML-1-like viruses in a group of monkeys called Old World monkeys ( OWM ) and great apes . These monkeys were recombinant with a HERIV-K-related virus , and the RNA from these monkeys was extracted from an ancient RNA molecule called the Rec Response Element ( RcRE ) that was replaced by a CTE . This region of the ERV-K protein contains a sequence called the 3′ long terminal repeat ( LTR ) between the env protein and the RcREA protein . A similar RNA sequence was also found in white-cheeked gibbon , suggesting that the insertions in the LTR are"

[ABSTRACT] Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds , elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process . Examining over 23 , 000 cells , we created a comprehensive single-cell atlas that captures the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds . Additionally , E. faecalis infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro , in vivo , and in our scRNA-seq atlas . Wound infections are highly prevalent and can lead to delayed or failed healing , causing significant morbidity and adverse economic impacts . To address this , we employed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model . Furthermore , we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils , which regulates chemokine signaling pathways , while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells . Enterococcus faecalis is often found in persistent non-healing wounds , but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied . We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection , jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment . Overall , our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faecalis in wound infections . These infections occur in various contexts , including diabetic foot ulcers , burns , and surgical sites . Notably , E. faecalis infection prompted a premature , incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes .
[INTRODUCTION] These insights from our scRNA-seq atlas provide a foundation for future studies aimed at investigating bacterial factors contributing to wound pathogenesis and understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with delayed healing . In the persistent phase at 3 dpi , the galactose and mannose uptake systems , in conjunction with the mprF gene product , are associated with nutrient acquisition and resistance to antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil-mediated killing , respectively . Nonetheless , the intricate interplay between these E. faecalis persistence-associated virulence factors , their immunomodulatory evasion strategies , and precise implications in the context of delayed wound healing remains to be investigated . However , these studies have primarily focused on cellular heterogeneity and the transcriptome of intact skin or uninfected wounds , offering limited insights into the dynamics of wound healing following infection . Additionally , E. faecalis has mechanisms to evade and suppress immune clearance by , for example , suppressing the pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype in macrophage and preventing neutrophil extracellular trap formation . Initially , bacterial colony-forming units ( CFU ) increase in number in the acute replication phase , with a concomitant pro-inflammatory response characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production coupled with neutrophil infiltration . In the subsequent persistence stage , E. faecalis CFU undergo gradual reduction and stabilization at approximately 105 CFU within wounds by 2-3 day post-infection ( dpi ) , coinciding with delayed wound healing . Enterococcus faecalis is a commensal bacterium in the human gut , and also an opportunistic pathogen responsible for various infections , including surgical site infections and diabetic ulcers . The inflammatory phase initiates migration of leukocytes into the wound site to help clear cell debris and establish tissue protection through local inflammation . Bacterial wound infections in general , including those associated with E. faecalis , are biofilm-associated , resulting in an antibiotic-tolerant population that may lead to persistent infections . We also noted E. faecalis infected-associated macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils , regulating chemokine signaling pathways and promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells . Infections pose a challenge to the wound healing process , affecting both the skin 's protective barrier and the efficient repair mechanisms required for tissue integrity . Initially , neutrophils , responding to pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β , TNF-α , and IFN-γ , extravasate through the endothelium to the site of injury . Within the skin , undifferentiated resident
[RESULTS] To validate the distinct fibroblast cell states and their differentiation potential , we performed RNA velocity analysis ( Figure 3H and I ) , which revealed two terminal fibroblast populations : ( 1 ) a Cilphi fibrotic cluster 4 and ( 2 ) an Mkxhi reparative cluster 5 , originating from clusters 0 and 2 ( Figure 3I and Supplementary file 7 ) , indicating the mesenchymal characteristics of infection-specific fibroblasts . Infected wounds showed downregulation of Mrc1 and upregulation of both Arg1 and Nos2 compared to uninfected wounds or unwounded bulk skin tissue ( Figure 4D ) , which was further corroborated by examining gene expression in bone-marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDM ) following E. faecalis infection in vitro ( Figure 4E ) .
[DISCUSSION] However , our study lacks a reference dataset of uninfected , unwounded dorsal skin transcriptome , which would have allowed us to investigate transcriptomic changes temporally , especially induced by the wounding alone . Although we explored public datasets to address this limitation , the low number of cells in public datasets , particularly for macrophage populations ( data not shown ) , prevented their inclusion in our analysis . Our study provides a comprehensive comparison of the transcriptomic and cellular communication profiles between uninfected and E. faecalis-infected full-thickness mouse skin wounds at 4 days post-infection . Additionally , the absence of multiple time points hinders our ability to examine temporal changes and the dynamic kinetics of host responses following infection .",,905,94,None,"Bacterial infections are a major public health problem in many countries , including the United States , where they can lead to serious health problems such as diabetes , heart disease , and cancer . The bacteria that cause these infections are known as Enterococcus faecalis , which is found in the skin of many people . However , it is not clear how the bacteria can cause wound infections . Infections with the bacteria cause the skin to become infected , leading to a delay in healing . This is because the bacteria are resistant to antibiotics and can evade the immune system . To combat this , the bacteria use a process called scRNA-seq to study the cells in the wound . Using a mouse model of the infection in which the bacteria were present , Xiao et al . used a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to examine over 23 , 000 cells from the wounds of mice . These cells were then compared to uninfected wounds in which they were infested .

Further analysis revealed that the CFU-sensing cells were also able to control the inflammatory response in response to the infection . Furthermore , E . ‘faeye’ , an opportunistic pathogen , was found to have a protective effect on endothelial cells , helping to prevent the infection from occurring again .

[ABSTRACT] This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants , by revealing that they can do both in sequence . Using a custom-built , high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( PTR-ToF-MS ) system , we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants . We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants , characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure . Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern . Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants ( senders ) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants ( receivers ) , however , the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon remain poorly studied . Instead , it is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day . The delayed burst occurs independent of day : night light transitions and can not be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics . This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night , but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants .
[INTRODUCTION] Although it is clear that plants can either be primed or directly induced following HIPV exposure , if and how these two phenomena integrate in the context of a natural HIPV exposure sequence is unclear . In order to understand the kinetics of information transfer between plants and the importance of dynamic temporal emission patterns , we monitored the emission kinetics of terpenes as a marker of defense activation in maize plants that were exposed to HIPVs . Green leaf volatiles ( GLVs ) , including ( Z ) -3-hexenyl acetate ( HAC ) , ( Z ) -3-hexenal , and ( Z ) -3-hexen-1-ol , are catabolic products of the lipoxygenase/hydroperoxide lyase pathway and are emitted within minutes following damage . Further , temporal trends might be complicated by dynamic environmental conditions , such as light fluctuations ; over a 24 hr period , plants can experience both full sun and darkness . We further measured foliar terpene pools , stress hormones , and defense gene expression in receiver plants , and determined the impact of day : night light transitions in the observed defense induction kinetics . It is possible that , through time , continuous HIPV exposure may result in a self-enforced positive feedback loop , whereby priming enhances induction and induction serves as a priming event for subsequent induction . We leveraged a highly temporally resolved volatile multiplexing system that allowed us to track continuous volatile emissions in sender and receiver plants for the first time in real time . In maize , GLVs have been implicated in direct induction , and both GLVs and indole are known to prime defenses , and are thus considered as 'bioactive ' in information transfer between plants . Together , our experiments reveal how the natural kinetics of herbivore attack result in a clocked defense response in neighboring plants via volatile information transfer . For example , artificial herbivory that mimics spatiotemporal patterns of chewing herbivores induces more a similar response to actual herbivore attack than when spatiotemporal patterns are ignored . Finally , we measured defenses upon sequences of short-term HIPV and GLV exposure to unravel the relative importance of direct induction and priming . Terpenes are a very diverse group of volatiles ( > 80 ,
[RESULTS] Based on the above observations , we reasoned that , under natural conditions , the strong delayed volatile burst may be due to the interaction of an initial volatile burst that primes plants for higher volatile release at the onset of the second day , and a secondary trigger in the form of bioactive volatiles released from sender plants at the onset of the second day . To determine if terpenes accumulate above daytime levels in maize leaves of HIPV-exposed plants during the night , we measured internal foliar pools of the sesquiterpenes , β-caryophyllene , β-farnesene , and α-bergamotene , as well as the homoterpene , TMTT , over time . This type of variation was not
[DISCUSSION] Given these considerations , together with the observed volatile release , response kinetics , and our manipulative experiments , we can draw up the following scenario : On day 1 , maize plants are exposed to GLVs , which trigger a small burst of terpene release in receiver plants . So far , studies in maize and other plants showing priming effects have often exposed receiver plants to HIPVs for several hours , overnight , or even for multiple days , and induced them , e. g. , by simulated herbivory , on the following day in the absence of HIPVs . Responding on the second day could be advantageous , as by this time , the natural enemies would have located and interacted with the herbivores on sender plants , and would thus be ready to move over to the next plant in anticipation of herbivore arrival . As fitness outcomes are
[METHODS] 15 mg of ground fresh frozen leaf tissue was added to a 20 ml precision thread headspace glass vial sealed with a magnetic screw cap fitted with a silicone/PTFE septum ( Gertel GmbH & Co. KG , Germany ) . In order to quantify GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested plants and HAC dispensers , we collected total volatile emissions",,970,97,None,"Plants use chemical compounds called volatiles to protect themselves from predators . These volatiles can be toxic to plants and animals , but they can also cause damage to other plants . For example , if a plant is attacked by a herbivore , it can trigger a chemical reaction that triggers the plant’s defense . The chemical reaction is known as “response” and can be used to help plants to survive . However , the timing of this reaction is not well understood , and it is unclear how the chemical reaction works . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry to measure the activity of volatiles in maize plants that had been exposed to a variety of chemicals . This allowed Wang to study the effects of exposure to different types of chemicals on the response of neighboring plants , including terpenes and jasmonate . Wang then measured the levels of terpenoid in the plants that were exposed to these chemicals , which were then exposed to the same chemicals for a period of 24 hours . When the plants were exposed , they were able to detect a burst in the amount of volatile molecules in the leaves of the plant . It was not clear how this bursted occurred , or how it could be explained by the time of day: night light transitions , however . In addition , when the plants are exposed to more than one type of chemical , their response to the chemical changes in the environment could be influenced by the temperature of the environment . Therefore , this study provides a new insight into how plants respond to chemical changes , as well as how they respond to changes in light ."

[ABSTRACT] Remarkably , three temporally and acoustically distinct call rhythms in the lower stratum were not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples , which suggests that these recursive structures were neither the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures nor anatomical artifacts of bodily constraints or resonances . There are , however , no known vocal sequences among nonhuman primates arranged in self-embedded patterns that evince vocal recursion or potential incipient or evolutionary transitional forms thereof , suggesting a neuro-cognitive transformation exclusive to humans . Second-order combinatorics , 'sequences within sequences ' , involving hierarchically organized and cyclically structured vocal sounds in ancient hominids may have preluded the evolution of recursion in modern language-able humans . Recursive procedures that allow placing a vocal signal inside another of a similar kind provide a neuro-computational blueprint for syntax and phonology in spoken language and human song . Here , we uncover that wild flanged male orangutan long calls feature rhythmically isochronous call sequences nested within isochronous call sequences , consistent with two hierarchical strata . Findings represent a case of temporally recursive hominid vocal combinatorics in the absence of syntax , semantics , phonology , or music .
[INTRODUCTION] Full pulses do not , however , always exhibit uninterrupted vocal production throughout a long call but can break up into four different 'sub-pulse ' element types : ( i ) grumble sub-pulses , ( ii ) sub-pulse transitory elements and ( iii ) pulse bodies ( typically constituting pulses before and/or after climax pulses ) , and ( iv ) bubble sub-pulses ( quick succession of staccato calls that typically constitute the last tail-off pulses of long calls ) ( Figure 1A ) . We extracted inter-onset intervals ( IOIs ; i. e. , time difference between the start of a vocal element and the preceding one - tk ) from 8993 vocal long call elements ( Figure 1A ) : 1930 full pulses , 757 grumble sub-pulses ( 731 ) , 1068 sub-pulse transitory elements ( 374 ) , 816 pulse bodies ( 11 ) , and 4422 bubble sub-pulses . A novel , direct approach to recursive vocal combinatorics in wild primates is desirable to help infer signal patterns that were recursive in some degree or kind in an extinct past , and molded subsequently into the recursive structures observed today in humans . We conducted precise rhythm analyses of 66 long call audio recordings produced by 10 orangutans ( Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii ) across approximately 2510 observation hours at Tuanan , Central Kalimantan , Indonesian Borneo . Under any evolutionary scenario , including punctuated hypotheses , ancestral signal function ( whether cooperative , competitive , or otherwise ) is expected to have derived or been leveraged by its proto-recursive structure . We identified five different element types that comprise the structural building blocks of long calls in the wild , of which the primary type are full pulses ( Figure 1A ) . For example , Chomsky 's definition of recursion can generate non-self-embedded signal structures , but these would be for that same reason operationally undetectable amongst other signal combinations . There are no certain parallels between semantic content and word meaning in animals , but analyses of signal patterning allow us to identify the similarities between non-semantic ( nonhuman ) and semantic ( human ) combinatoric systems . We then computed the distribution of these ratios to ascertain whether the rhythm of long call full and sub-pulses presented natural categories , following published protocols
[RESULTS] Permuted discriminant function analyses ( crossed , in order to control for individual variation ) in R based on seven acoustic measures extracted from grumble , transitory elements , and bubble sub-pulses confirmed that these represented indeed acoustically distinct sub-pulse categories , where the percentage of correctly classified selected cases ( 62 . 046 of their comprising full pulses ( Figure 1D ) , which puts sub-pulses at an approximate ratio of 1:22 relative to that of full pulses , the smallest categorical temporal rhythmic interval registered thus far in a vertebrate . 493 ) in close vicinity to a theoretically pure isochronic rhythm , that is , full pulses were regularly paced at a 1:1 ratio , following a constant
[DISCUSSION] Such classifications may be putting the proverbial cart before the horse ; they are based on untested assumptions that may not have applied to proto-recursive ancestors , for example , that syntax and phonology evolved as separate 'modules ' , that one attained modern form before the other , or that they evolved in hominids regardless of whether consonant-like and vowel-like calls were present or not . The occurrence of three non-exclusive recursive patterns ( i. e. , three acoustically distinct sub-pulse calls occurring at three distinct tempi nested within the same pulse-level tempo ) substantially decreases the probability that recursion was the by-product of anatomic constraints , such as vocal fold oscillation , breath length , heartbeat , and other physiological processes or movements . Future studies on primate vocal combinatorics , particularly undertaking a structural approach and in the wild , offer promising new paths to empirically assess possible precursors and proto-states for the evolution of
[METHODS] Acoustic data extraction complemented the classification of long calls elements , both at the pulse and sub-pulse levels , based on close visual and auditory inspection of spectrograms , both based on elements ' distinctiveness between each other as well as in relation to the remaining cataloged orangutan call repertoire . 69 Hz ; grid time resolution : 256 samples",,957,96,None,"The sounds of the human voice are often referred to as long calls . These calls are made by a group of animals called orangutans , which are found in the jungles of Indonesia and Borneo . The sounds are arranged in a series of patterns , called “sequences within sequences” . In ancient hominids , the sounds are composed of a number of different types of sounds , each of which has its own rhythm . For example , if a call is made by an animal called Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii , it can be made by either a male or a female . However , in modern humans , there are no known patterns of long calls in the wild . Instead , they are recursive , consisting of alternating short and long sounds . This suggests that recursion may have been a process in which a vocal signal is placed inside another of corresponding kinds . It is not clear whether this process was a natural process or if it had been used to create a new type of sound . To investigate this question , Wang et al . recorded long calls produced by 10 oranquitans in the Indonesian Bornean jungle . Long calls were recorded for about 2510 hours , and the recordings were analyzed using a computer program called X-ray crystallography . Wang flanged the recordings and found that the recordings contained two distinct rhythms . One of these rhythms was nested within a second rhythm , while the other rhythm was slowed down , suggesting that the rhythms were not related to the rhythm at the higher stratum . Furthermore , three of the different rhythms in the lower stratum were not associated"

[ABSTRACT] Firstly , the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes , with homology-dependent genetic compensation response ( HDGCR ) being the main pathway . In summary , our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus , offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system . Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of M. miiuy and Gallus gallus , the homolog of RIG-I , can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5'ppp-RNA virus , which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution . Secondly , as an adversarial strategy , 5'ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability , thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion . During this process , the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection . Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5'ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish , Miichthys miiuy . The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life 's evolution .
[INTRODUCTION] Therefore , in this study , we selected teleost fish miiuy croaker ( Miichthys miiuy ) and bird chicken ( Gallus gallus ) , two vertebrates lacking RIG-I , as well as two 5'ppp-RNA viruses ( SCRV and VSV ) , to investigate the evolutionary strategies and interactions between 5'ppp-RNA virus and host . Tupaia belangeri , a mammal lacking RIG-I , has been reported to possess the MDA5 protein , which has undergone positive selection and exhibits the ability to sense Sendai virus ( an RNA virus posed as a RIG-I agonist ) for inducing type I IFN . The specific roles of RIG-I and MDA5 in response to virus stimulation are not redundant : RIG-I detects short blunt-end RNA with a 5'-triphosphate motif ( 5'ppp-RNA ) , while MDA5 specifically recognizes long forms of viral dsRNA . The functional impact of N6-methylation on RNA characteristics typically remains latent until recognition by 'reader ' proteins , such as members of the YTHDF protein family , encompassing YTH domain family 1 ( YTHDF1 ) , YTHDF2 , and YTHDF3 . Some studies have proposed that LGP2 is crucial for the production of type I interferon ( IFN-I ) in response to several RIG-I- and MDA5-dependent viruses , whereas others have described LGP2 as a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling . Retinoic-acid-induced RIG-I-like receptors ( RLRs ) are a specific group of PRRs belonging to the family of DExD/H-box RNA helicases , and they play a crucial role in the innate antiviral response . This study provides insights into the compensatory mechanism of RIG-I deficiency in vertebrates , however , considering the dynamic nature of host-virus dynamics , further research is urgently needed to validate and expand these insights . By utilizing these m6A-related enzymes in the host , viruses can not only use m6A modification to hide themselves and avoid recognition by host receptors but also manipulate host gene expression to enable immune evasion . Conversely , N6-demethylation is chiefly modulated by 'eraser ' proteins , with fat mass and obesity-associated protein ( FTO ) and AlkB homolog 5 ( ALKBH5 ) being the identified enzymes for this role . In summary , these findings shed light on the functional diversity of innate antiviral activity and unveil a complex arms race between virus replication
[RESULTS] We further inserted the MDA5-exon1 into pmirGLO , and results showed that the infection of SCRV can reduce the luciferase activity of pmirGLO-MDA5-exon1 , and the use of cycloleucine ( CL , an amino acid analogue that can inhibit m6A modification ) hindered the degradation of MDA5-exon1 by SCRV , indicating that SCRV can regulate MDA5 expression through a methylation mechanism ( Figure 5G ) . The C-terminal regulatory domain ( RD ) of human RIG-I binds to viral RNA in a triphosphate-dependent manner , to determine if the RD domain of M. miiuy MDA5 has similar functions , we generated truncated mutations called MDA5-ΔRD and western blot analysis confirmed the expression of MDA5 and MDA5-ΔRD plasmids ( Figure
[DISCUSSION] Next , by linking the immune replacement ability evolved by MDA5 with the common RIG-I loss event in vertebrates , we propose a straightforward explanation for this evolutionary event : In the lengthy process of vertebrate evolution , MDA5 gradually acquired new functionalities to effectively detect viruses such as 5'ppp-RNAs , which were initially recognized by RIG-I . SCRV and VSV belongs to the class of rhabdovirus , which is a negative-strand virus with a non-segmented genome and initiate both replication and transcription de novo leading to 5′-triphosphate RNA in the cytosol , was expected to trigger an IFN response without the need for replication and presumed dsRNA formation . Fish and birds , as the most abundant aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates respectively , are also the two lineages with the most frequent occurrence of RIG-I deficiency , the investigation of host-pathogen interactions of them offers valuable insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors that
[METHODS] In order to identify the MDA5 and LGP2 from M. miiuy , we used the homologues of zebrafish reported previously as queries to seek for the transcriptome and a chromosome-scale genome database Xu et al. , 2024 of M. miiuy by using local TBLASTN and BLASTN programs , then the protein structures were predicted by SMART website ( http",,967,97,None,"The immune system consists of a group of proteins called receptors . These receptors are found on the surface of cells , and they are used by viruses to initiate infection . However , it is not clear how these receptors work . To understand how the immune system works , researchers have studied the interactions between the receptors and viruses . In particular , they have found that the receptor MDA5 , which is a member of the receptor family , is able to detect short RNA molecules with a 5’-triphosphate motif ( 5’ppp-RNA ) , while the receptor RIG-I is unable to recognize long RNA . This suggests that the immune response to a virus can be modified by a process known as the “arms race” . The arms race between viruses and their hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life’s evolution . For example , a fish called Miichthys miiuy croaker has been shown to have a mutation in the receptor for the 5'ppp RNA virus , but it was not clear whether this mutation was due to the fact that it was missing from the genome of the fish . Now , Wang et al . have used a technique called genetic compensation to study how the MDA-5 receptor and the 5 ‘ppp’RNA virus interact . Using this technique , the researchers found that two different viruses , SCRV and VSV , had different roles in their immune responses to the virus . One of these viruses – called 5’Ppp-RAV – could use the m6A modification to degrade the receptor , thus causing it to lose its ability to recognize the virus and cause it to replicate . Furthermore , this may lead to the loss of the M"

[ABSTRACT] Since androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) has a profound impact on circulating FSH concentrations , this hormone could potentially be implicated in the changes of fat body mass ( FBM ) , lean body mass ( LBM ) , and bone fragility induced by ADT . The objective of this study is to correlate FSH serum levels with body composition parameters , bone mineral density ( BMD ) , and bone turnover markers at baseline conditions and after 12 months of ADT . Therefore , FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and to guide the clinicians in the tailored evaluation of body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT . The funder had no role in design and conduct of the study , collection , management , analysis , and interpretation of the data and in preparation , review , or approval of the manuscript . Twenty-nine consecutive non-metastatic prostate cancer ( PC ) patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2019 in a phase IV study . On the other hand , an inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio was observed ( r = −0 . FBM , LBM , and BMD were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 12 months of ADT . Among its extragonadal effects , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) has an impact on body composition and bone metabolism . For outcome measurements and statistical analysis , t-test or sign test and Pearson or Spearman tests for continuous variables were used when indicated . At baseline conditions , a weak , non-significant , direct relationship was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms ( r = 0 . FSH , alkaline phosphatase , and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months . FSH serum levels after ADT could have an impact on body composition , in particular on FBM . This is an ancillary study of a prospective trial and this is the main limitation . All patients underwent administration of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degarelix . Conversely , a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FBM ( r = 0 . This research was partially funded by Ferring Pharmaceuticals . gov NCT03202381 , EudraCT Number 2016-004210-10 . 004 ) , and fat mass at trunk ( r = 0 . 018 )
[INTRODUCTION] We recently conducted the BLADE study ( Bone mineraL mAss Dexa dEgarelix ) , a prospective phase IV study designed to obtain explorative information on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) measurement changes in lean body mass ( LBM ) and fat body mass ( FBM ) in patients with non-metastatic PC treated with degarelix , an LHRH ( luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ) antagonist that has been developed to achieve effective long-term medical castration without the risk of testosterone surge and its associated flare . Large epidemiologic data have shown significant reductions in bone mineral density ( BMD ) and high resorption rates 2-3 years prior to menopause , when FSH serum levels are increasing , which is also associated with increased body weight and visceral adiposity . Furthermore , FSH was found to have a positive action on adipocytes and the blockade of FSH induced by antibodies against FSH receptor caused an increase in bone mass and a reduction of body fat . Here , we analyse the association of FSH with DXA-assessed FBM , LBM , and BMD and bone turnover markers at baseline and after degarelix administration in the patients enrolled in the BLADE study . A longitudinal study involving post-menopausal women has shown that increases in circulating FSH levels were associated with greater increases in the percentage of total body fat , total body fat mass , and subcutaneous adipose tissue . Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown that follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) exerts effects beyond those on gonadal tissue , which have been known for a long time . A large cohort study of perimenopausal women showed that increased FSH concentrations were associated with increasing fat mass and decreasing lean mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis . Likewise , the interaction between the variation of FSH serum levels and the modification of these parameters in PC patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) is not known
[RESULTS] At baseline conditions no relationship was found between FSH serum levels and the following DXA-derived parameters : BMD at left hip and spine , total FBM , total LBM , lean mass at arms and legs , ALMI , ALMI/FBM ratio , and android/gynoid ratio . The correlation between circulating FSH levels at 6 and 12 months , bone turnover markers evaluated at the same time , BMD and body composition parameters assessed after 12 months is shown in Table 2 . In contrast , FSH serum levels after 6 months of treatment showed an inverse relationship with ALMI/FBM ratio (
[DISCUSSION] Indeed , the protocol of BLADE study did not include measurement of testosterone values , since radioimmunoassay and chemiluminescence assay used in clinical practice could overestimate testosterone levels in majority of patients under ADTs , leaving a concern of misdiagnosing truly castrate patients as being inadequately treated . FSH could be a promising marker in monitoring PC patients during ADT in order to identify those who are more vulnerable and at greater risk of alterations in body composition , which can be captured and measured reliably by DXA . However , since sex hormones were not measured in our patients , it was unclear whether the possible variability in testosterone values during degarelix treatment might have influenced the detrimental effects of FSH and body composition . During the recent years ,
[METHODS] Despite the lean mass measured by DXA counts also skin , connective tissue , and some lean components within the adipose tissue , it still correlates highly with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging measurements and represents a good approximation of the real muscle mass . Given that type I",,1037,90,Exceeds token limit (1037/1024),"The body is made up of cells called follicles , which are responsible for producing hormones called hormones . These cells are known as adipose tissue , and they help to regulate the body’s metabolism . However , it is not clear how these cells work together to produce hormones that can affect body composition . A hormone called luteinizing hormone ( FSH ) has been shown to have an effect on body composition and bone turnover , but it has been unclear how this hormone affects body composition in patients with prostate cancer . In this study , researchers used a technique called dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to measure the levels of FSH in prostate cancer patients . The results showed that FSH levels were associated with increased body fat , lean body mass , bone turnover and bone density , respectively . FSH was found to have a positive effect on adipocytes and the blockade of the FSH receptor caused an increase in body fat and a reduction in body weight . This could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and to guide the clinicians in the tailored evaluation of body composition during prostate cancer treatment ."

[ABSTRACT] We used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic HF , such as a prolonged QT interval , a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD , and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2 . Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation , thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD . These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation , such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD . We tested the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability , mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function . We assessed the incidence of VT/VF and SCD ( primary outcome ) , ECG heart rate and QT variability , echocardiographic left ventricular ( LV ) structure and function , immunohistochemical LV fibrosis , and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation . Compared to placebo , DS lowered resting heart rate , preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge , and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function . Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation ( VT/VF ) is a leading cause of death , but current therapies are limited . Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels , none have proven sufficiently effective for preventing SCD . Sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 ( RyR2 ) Ca2+ release channels , the downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels , are underexplored in this context . Recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) -mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s in the pathophysiology of SCD . DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias . HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene ( DS ) or placebo in early or chronic HF . Moreover , the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function .
[INTRODUCTION] A growing body of evidence indicates that sympathetic stress-induced hyperactivity of the RyR2 , located in the SR of cardiac myocytes , causes SR Ca2+ leak , which contributes to the pathogenesis of VT/VF and SCD . In diseased and/or stressed hearts , PKA-mediated hyper-phosphorylation and ROS-mediated oxidation results in a leaky RyR2 , which allows Ca2+ to leak out of SR during diastole . The present study employs a guinea-pig model that recapitulates key features of human non-ischemic HF including spontaneous episodes of VT/VF resulting in SCD . We hypothesized that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability , mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function . Moreover , many patients suffer from VT/VF and SCD in the early stages of HF before they become eligible to receive an ICD . We examine the effects of chronic dantrolene treatment on the incidence of VT/VF and SCD incidence as non-ischemic HF develops and progresses . Antiarrhythmic drugs , which target ion channels , may confer acute benefits but can also be proarrhythmic , triggering VT/VF . The findings have important implications for repurposing dantrolene , a clinically-used RyR2 inhibitor , as a potential new therapy for HF and SCD . Recent evidence suggests that dantrolene , a RyR2 inhibitor , reduces the inducibility of atrial fibrillation in animals with myocardial infarction . The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ levels also leads to DADs , which can trigger atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias . For example , ICDs , the only effective therapy for VT/VF and SCD , are palliative , expensive , and pose several risks . During systole , the release of Ca2+ by the RyR2 plays a pivotal role in myocyte excitation-contraction coupling . The effect of RyR2 inhibition on ventricular arrhythmias and non-ischemic HF has been unexplored . The degree of contractility is determined by the amount of Ca2+ in the SR and by the timing and magnitude of Ca2+ release . Thus , there is a pressing need to identify new antiarrhythmic targets and develop new therapies for SCD . In cross-over studies , we determine whether RyR2 inhibition reverses HF and SCD
[RESULTS] A crossover study was designed where ( i ) only vehicle was administered until the endpoint i. e. , week 4 ( HF ) ( ii ) DS was administered at the onset of aortic constriction until chronic contractile dysfunction is evident in the HF group ( usually 3 weeks post-banding ; HF+/−DS ) or ( iii ) after HF had already developed ( 3 weeks post-banding ; HF−/+DS group ) ( Figure 6A ) . Echocardiography measures ( Figure 2B ) show that the relative wall thickness ( RWT ) , which is a measure of the LV dimensions and is a marker for adverse events in LV dysfunction , was
[DISCUSSION] This study demonstrates that inhibition of Ca2+ leak via RyR2 pauses the transition to heart failure by reducing cardiac fibrosis , increasing repolarization lability , and decreasing QT heterogeneity , improving chronotropic competency , ultimately improving LV contractility , and mitigating lethal VT/VF . Damage caused by oxidative stress alters the proteomic profile of the cell , including altering expression levels as well as the structure and function of EC-coupling proteins . Given that dantrolene is available for clinical use , future studies should evaluate its efficacy in humans with heart failure .
[METHODS] To determine the oxidation status of RyR2 , the Carbonyl Content Assay Kit was used , whereby carbonyl groups of immunoprecipitated RyR2 were derivatized to 2 , 4 dinitrophenylhydrazone ( DNP ) by reaction with 2 , 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine which can be quantified using a spectrophotometer at 375 nm . A pressure overload model of",,975,97,None,"Heart failure is a leading cause of death worldwide , but the treatment for heart failure is limited . Many patients suffer from sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) in the early stages of the disease before they become eligible to receive an ICD . However , there are currently no treatments available to treat this condition , and it is not clear how these patients will develop . One of the most common causes of SCD is ventricular tachycardia ( VT/VF ) , which is caused by a protein called the ryanodine receptor 2 ( RyR2 ) that is responsible for regulating the activity of the ion channels in the heart . The RyR1 is located in the sarcolemmal ionic channel , where it is released into the bloodstream . It is also known as the repolarization channel . In some cases , the rhododendrone ( DS ) is used as a drug to treat heart failure . But , it is still not known how the DS drug works . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a guinea pig model to study the effects of DS on the risk of developing SCD in the first few weeks of life . This model showed that DS treatment reduced the rate at which the heart beats and improved the ability of the heart to contract properly . These results suggest that dantrolene is an effective treatment for SCD because it reduces the damage caused by the oxidation of sarcoplasmic ryans , a group of ions found in the blood . Furthermore , this treatment reduces how much Ca2+ is released from the SR during diastole , making it easier for the heart muscle"

[ABSTRACT] Smads and their transcription factor partners mediate the transcriptional responses of target cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) family , including those of the conserved bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) family , yet only a small number of direct target genes have been well characterized . Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that in turn regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation . Here , we identify functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri based on ChIP-seq peaks ( identified by modEncode ) and expression differences of nearby genes identified from RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants . Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) secretory pathway , including the disulfide reductase dpy-11 . Mutations in sma-9 partially suppress the small body size phenotype of sma-3 , suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnurri function . At a genome-wide scale , SMA-3/Smad acts as a transcriptional activator , whereas SMA-9/Schnurri direct targets include both activated and repressed genes . In C. elegans , the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates multiple biological functions , including body size , via a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade . We found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes .
[INTRODUCTION] Unlike for the core components of the signaling pathway , however , loss of SMA-9 function can result in a different effect depending on the phenotype , suggesting that this factor can either be an equivalent co-factor , a factor with a more limited role , or an antagonistic factor depending on the specific function . At the brinker locus in Drosophila and the Xvent2 locus in Xenopus , binding of an R-Smad and a Co-Smad with a precise 5 bp spacing between binding sites has been shown to recruit Schnurri , which controls the direction of transcriptional regulation . Finally , we use a ROL-6 : :wrmScarlet reporter for collagen synthesis and secretion to show that SMA-3 , SMA-9 , and the transcriptional target gene DPY-11 regulate body size growth by promoting the secretion and delivery of collagen into the cuticle . In this study , we use BETA software to combine RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets for SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri to identify direct versus indirect target genes of these factors , as well as to identify common versus unique targets . In nematodes , body size is constrained by a collagen-rich cuticle , which is secreted by an epidermal layer ( the hypodermis ) and remodeled over four successive molts during larval growth and then continuously during adulthood . The exact mechanism by which the DBL-1 pathway regulates body size is not fully understood , but is known to involve the regulated synthesis of cuticular collagen , of which there are over 170 genes . DBL-1 signals through type I receptor SMA-6 , type II receptor DAF-4 , and Smads SMA-2 , SMA-3 , and SMA-4 ( founding members of the Smad family ) , which act together in the hypodermis to promote body size growth during the earliest larval growth stages . We use GO term analysis and loss-of-function studies that shed light on the downstream effectors for body size regulation , lipid metabolism , and innate immunity . The SBE is considered too degenerate and low affinity to account fully for binding specificity , so transcription factor partners likely contribute to target gene selection . To date , only a few direct target genes of Smads have been extensively studied
[RESULTS] We , therefore , considered these instances of overlapping peaks to be evidence of SMA-3/SMA-9 association ( possibly physical complexes , although this would require a formal biochemical demonstration ) , whereas adjacent but non-overlapping peaks likely represent an independent binding , leading us to conclude that ( 1 ) SMA-3 typically binds together with SMA-9 to DNA sites , and that ( 2 ) over half of all SMA-9 sites do not overlap with these SMA-3 occupied sites . Consistent with our results in the wild-type background , we found that SMA-3-exclusive regulators of body size were enriched for chaperones and factors involved in ER secretion , whereas co-regulated genes mediating body size growth were
[DISCUSSION] One powerful element of our approach was that our ChIP-seq/RNA-seq BETA analysis identified direct target genes and combined those findings with a functional analysis of a subset of those targets , thereby demonstrating that a combination of SMA-3-exclusive targets ( including chaperones and collagen secretion factors ) work together with SMA-3/SMA-9 co-regulated targets ( including collagen genes and factors involved in one-carbon metabolism ) to affect the process of body growth through their regulation of the extracellular matrix of the surrounding cuticle . By using an analysis pipeline that combines BETA , which integrates ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to identify targets , with LOA , which integrates two separate RNA-seq pairwise comparisons to identify shared DEGs , we identified nearby direct transcriptional targets based on their functional impact on transcript levels in corresponding mutants . The thioredoxin-like DPY-11 was a particularly compelling target given its established role in cuticle formation and
[METHODS] Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) using a poly-clonal goat IgG anti-GFP antibody ( a gift from Tony Hyman and Kevin White ) was performed on L2 stage nematodes by Michelle Kudron ( Valerie Reinke Model Organism ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements and model organism Encyclopedia of Regulatory Networks group ) on the sma-3 ( wk30 ) ;",,979,97,None,"Body size is the number of cells in a body . The size of a cell depends on how much collagen it contains , and how much it needs to be able to grow properly . In nematodes , body size is controlled by a protein called the bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) , which is found in the skin . This protein is known to regulate the production of collagen , but it is not clear how it does this . A protein called Smads binds to a gene called Schnurri , a member of the BMP family , to regulate body size . However , it was not clear whether Schnursi is involved in body size regulation . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called ChIP-seq to identify genes that are involved in the secretion of collagen into the cuticle of worms . These genes were then compared to the expression levels of other genes , including genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and the endoplasmic reticulum secretory pathway . Using a computer program called BETA , the researchers found that Smad-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner , SMA-9/Schneurri have both overlapping and unique targets . Mutations in Smad-3 and SMA9/Schnerri partially suppressed the small body size of Sma-3 , suggesting that the two factors have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic interactions that in turn regulate the release of extracellular components such as collagen ."

[ABSTRACT] DUX4 expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort , with DUX4 expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year . The embryonic transcription factor DUX4 was recently characterized as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation that is aberrantly expressed in a small subset of primary tumors . Here , we report that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors , with ~10-50 % of advanced bladder , breast , kidney , prostate , and skin cancers expressing DUX4 . DUX4 expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients . Our data motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance . Cancer immune evasion contributes to checkpoint immunotherapy failure in many patients with metastatic cancers .
[INTRODUCTION] These mechanisms include defects in Major Histocompatibility Complex ( MHC ) class I-mediated antigen presentation due to loss of B2M or HLA , PTEN and LSD1 inactivation , which sensitizes tumor cells to type I interferon signaling , T cell dysfunction , presence of specific T cell populations in the tumor microenvironment , and active WNT-β-catenin signaling . We additionally observed signals that DUX4 expression was associated with reduced survival following response to anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 in melanoma ; however , those analyses relied upon two small cohorts ( n = 27 or 41 patients ) , limiting the statistical power of our conclusions . Since DUX4 expression in cancer cells suppresses MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation , we hypothesized that DUX4 expression might be particularly common in the setting of metastatic disease ( vs. the primary cancers that we studied previously ) , where immune evasion is particularly important . Mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling in BRAF-mutated melanomas and CDK4/CDK6 activity have also been implicated in reduced ICI efficacy , and combination treatment with an MAPK/CDK inhibitor improves response to checkpoint blockade . Recent work from our group and others showed that DUX4 is expressed in a small subset of primary tumors , where it suppresses tumor cell antigen presentation and response to IFN-γ signaling . Similarly , a recent study reported a splicing-augmenting mutation in JAK3 , linked to decreased JAK3 expression levels , as a potential mechanism of resistance in a patient with metastatic melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy . Blockade of T cell co-inhibitory receptors , such as CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis , has achieved major success in the treatment of diverse metastatic cancers compared to first-line chemotherapy . This pathway induces expression of genes involved in MHC class I-mediated antigen processing and presentation , which include genes encoding the TAP1/TAP2 transporters , components of the immunoproteasome , HLA proteins , and B2M . However , a majority of advanced cancer patients fail to respond to ICI due to de novo or acquired resistance , the mechanistic bases of which remain incompletely understood . DUX4 expression levels peak at the 4-cell stage of the cleavage embryo ; DUX4 is then immediately silenced via epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 repeat array that contains the DUX4 gene . Indeed , decreased ICI efficacy was observed in patients with tumors harboring inactivating mutations in IFN-γ
[RESULTS] We sought to determine if the DUX4 transcripts in metastatic cancers express the entire coding sequence or only a portion thereof , as expressed DUX4 truncations due to genomic rearrangements are frequent oncogenic drivers in particular cancer subtypes , most notably undifferentiated round cell sarcomas ( CIC-DUX4 oncoprotein ) and adolescent B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . Conversely , DUX4 expression , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS ) > 0 , and previous administration of platinum chemotherapy were correlated with increased risk ( or shorter survival ) , while other features that have previously been reported as associated with reduced survival e. g. , TGFB1 expression did not remain significant after controlling for TMB and other variables . Second
[DISCUSSION] While the mechanism governing DUX4 de-repression in cancer remains to be elucidated , we show that DUX4 expression in the metastatic context is associated with reduced anti-tumor immunity , mirroring previous observations in primary cancers and cancer cell line models , and is correlated with decreased patient survival under ICI treatment . Altogether , these results possibly indicate the existence of co-occurring conditions in patients with higher degrees of disability , predisposing them to adverse effects associated with ICI treatment- comorbidities whose effects presumably manifest shortly after therapy commencement . As these become available in the future , extending the analyses we have outlined in this study will be important to appraise DUX4 's definitive clinical relevance , contextualized among response-modifying clinical variables , in the use of immunotherapy in the treatment of metastatic cancer . We also report that DUX4 expression in metastasis is correlated with downregulation of TIGIT and other immune checkpoints whose interception are currently under clinical investigation :
[METHODS] Here , B bootstrap datasets are created from the original data , used to grow B concomitant survival trees ( usually constrained by membership size in the terminal nodes ) constructed using a randomly selected subset of the variables . The time-dependent AUCC/D and 95 % confidence interval per timepoint were estimated using the timeROC package , which adds the inverse-probability-of-censoring weights",,942,95,None,"Cancer is the most common cancer in the world , with more than half of the world’s population suffering from cancer . The majority of cancers are caused by mutations in genes that control how the immune system recognizes and responds to certain types of cells . However , some cancers do not respond to these changes , and many patients do not receive treatment for their cancers . In some cases , cancer cells can become infected with a protein called DUX4 . This protein is known as a tumor suppressor , but it is not known how it is used to suppress the immune response . Now , Wang et al . have found that a small subset of metastatic cancers express the gene for a transcription factor called Dulx4 , which is also known to be involved in preventing cancer cells from expressing the protein . These tumors are often treated with chemotherapy or other drugs that block the immune responses of the tumor cells , causing them to fail to respond to the treatment . Wang , Zhang ed . now show that the gene that encodes Dulex4 is also present in some cancer cells – including bladder , breast , kidney , prostate , skin , liver , lung , etc . – despite the fact that it has been shown to be associated with reduced survival . To test this hypothesis , Wu el . studied a large cohort of patients with metastatic tumors , where the tumors were treated with two different chemotherapy drugs . One drug , called PD-1 , was effective in reducing the number of cancer cells that responded to the chemotherapy . Another drug aimed at reducing cancer cells’ ability to produce the protein was also effective in treating melanoma . Thus , the results of Wang "

[ABSTRACT] Several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa surveillance data rarely include information from abortions , little is known about aetiology and impacts , and data are not available to inform interventions . If so , samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate ( a ) determinants of attribution ; ( b ) patterns of events , including species and breed , previous abortion history , and seasonality ; ( c ) determinants of reporting , investigation and attribution ; ( d ) cases involving zoonotic pathogens . Livestock abortion surveillance , even at a small scale , can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks , reproductive losses and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance . This study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system , achieved through engagement of community-based field officers , establishment of practical sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic platforms . This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform established in Tanzania spanning pastoral , agropastoral and smallholder systems to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion . Lack of data on the aetiology of livestock diseases constrains effective interventions to improve livelihoods , food security and public health . Between 2017-2019 , 215 events in cattle ( n=71 ) , sheep ( n=44 ) , and goats ( n=100 ) were investigated . Abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers ( LFO ) and on to investigation teams . Events were included if the research team or LFO could attend within 72 hr . Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples . Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome affecting productivity and public health . 5 % of cases , was significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples . Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection . Attribution , achieved for 19 .
[INTRODUCTION] Challenges relate to timely collection of diagnostic samples , sample availability and deterioration , biases in detectability of agents , as well as complexities around establishment of a causal aetiology , particularly for pathogens such as Coxiella burnetii and Escherichia coli , which can often be present as incidental infections . However , systematic reviews of the literature that collectively cover a period from 2000 to 2016 indicate that syndromic surveillance programmes have mostly been implemented in Europe , North America or Australasia with only a single pilot project identified in Africa . This involves the collection , analysis and interpretation of information through both formal and informal channels to rapidly identify unusual or unexpected health events , such as disease outbreaks , emerging infectious diseases , or other public health threats . Over the past decade , increasing attention has been given to animal health syndromic surveillance , which relies on detection of health indicators , such as livestock abortion , that are discernible before a confirmed diagnosis is made . Although the WHO guidelines for event-based surveillance make explicit reference to the capture of information around unusual disease events in animals , the development of integrated early-warning systems involving animal disease events is still very limited . Effective livestock health surveillance provides critical data for evidence-based approaches to livestock disease control and management but this requires reliable , high-quality , and timely data that can be drawn from multiple sources . While this study was not designed as a systematic or comprehensive evaluation of a surveillance system , we present data on several key attributes of the platform , including simplicity , data quality , representativeness , timeliness , and usefulness . With several abortigenic agents also causing emerging livestock diseases , for example those caused by Schmallenberg virus , bluetongue virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus , livestock abortion may represent a particularly important syndromic target for zoonotic and emerging disease surveillance . In addition , livestock reproductive losses reduce income ( from sales of meat and milk ) , and cause a loss of livestock
[RESULTS] The sample types that were collected in each of these 41 cases for which an attribution was made using PCR , and whether the samples returned a positive or negative result , are shown in Figure 5 . The reasons given for failure to collect placental and foetal tissues included : ( a ) the tissues not being seen by owners ( for example if the animal aborted while away grazing ) ; ( b ) the tissues being burned by the owner ; and ( c ) the tissues being consumed by dogs or other animals . From the Pearson correlation analysis , no significant association was found
[DISCUSSION] One possible explanation is that , in comparison to sheep and cattle , fewer data are available worldwide on causes of abortions in goats and very little is known about the aetiology of goat abortions in Africa , so the pathogens included in our diagnostic panel may not have been as relevant for goats as for sheep and cattle . Our results may simply reflect a higher likelihood of reporting of abortion in animals that are of higher value and more likely to be zero-grazed or tethered while grazing ( and hence abortions would be more apparent ) and for which an existing relationship with animal health services is more likely . The risk of exposure to zoonotic pathogens through abortion cases was underscored by two findings : first that , in nearly 80 % of cases in which a pathogen was
[METHODS] LFOs were instructed to provide farmers with advice as to locally appropriate preventive measures that could be taken to reduce transmission or contamination risks associated with abortion cases , which included safe removal of abortion tissues from livestock-occupied areas ( e. g. burning , burying or covering the tissues in thorny branches ; Supplementary",,1011,99,None,"Livestock abortion is a serious health problem that affects millions of people in Africa . It is caused by a bacteria called Coxiella burnetii , which causes a disease called bluetongue , and can cause a number of other diseases , including zoonotic diseases . However , it is not clear how this disease is caused , or how it affects livestock production . In Africa , there are many different types of abortions , but it is difficult to identify the cause of these events . One way to find out more about the causes of these diseases is to use a method called molecular diagnostics . This technique uses a small amount of blood sample to collect samples from cattle , sheep , goats and other animals . Then , a team of field officers gathered samples from the cattle and sheep . They then asked the farmers to report the abortions to the authorities . During the investigation , the farmers were asked to provide information about the events , such as the species and breed of the animals , previous abortion history and seasonality . These data were collected using a variety of methods . For example , urine samples were collected from cows and sheep and collected from swabs . Some of the samples were taken from the cows before they were collected , while others were collected after they had been collected from the sheep and goat . All of the data was collected in a timely manner , with no delays in collecting the samples . There was also a lack of information on the causes and effects of abortion . To address this problem , Ngada et al . set out to establish a surveillance system in Tanzania to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortions in rural areas .

[ABSTRACT] Moreover , NIC induces Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif ( TAZ ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAchR ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation ; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells . Hence , this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors . In this study , we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) in vivo and ex vivo . NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc , DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth . Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases . The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs . However , knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited . Nicotine ( NIC ) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke .
[INTRODUCTION] Cigarette smoke contains a wide range of compounds that are harmful to human health ; nicotine ( NIC ) derivatives 4- ( methylnitrosamino ) -1- ( 3-pyridyl ) -1-butanone ( NNK ) and N'-nitrosonornicotine ( NNN ) are highly carcinogenic , which can induce mutations in tumor suppressive genes like Rasa , Trp53 , and Rb . This study can potentially contribute to the comprehensive knowledge on the pathway by which stem cells respond to NIC , a major component of cigarette smoke , and suggest an effective new strategy for the treatment of smoking-related colon cancer . For instance , long-term high-fat diet ( HFD ) -induced obesity enhances the self-renewal potential of ISC and promotes in vivo formation of tumors via the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta in ISCs . Although NIC itself , the addictive component in cigarette smoke , is generally considered to have a limited ability to initiate cancer , it can stimulate several effects crucial for cancer development independently . Most of the ISCs are leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 ( Lgr5 ) +ones that regulate intestinal homeostasis in response to dietary signals . Moreover , cigarette smoking has emerged as a potential major risk factor associated with colon cancer , along with metabolic risk factors such as diet and obesity . Previous studies indicate that cigarette smoking is significantly associated with colon cancer and mortality in humans and animal models . In this study , we aimed to demonstrate the effects of NIC treatment on the functions of murine ISCs ex vivo and in vivo . Moreover , we explored the molecular factors and signaling cascades prospectively associated with the regulation of the effects of NIC on ISCs . However , knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated ISC functions and intestinal tumorigenicity is limited . Abnormal stem cell functions are significantly associated with age-related organ dysfunction and carcinogenesis . Paneth cells constitute the niche for ISCs that reside at the bottom of the crypts . Intestinal epithelial turnover is sustained by intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) and adjacent Paneth cells . In the intestine , Lgr5 +ISCs are possibly the origin of precancerous adenomas . All tissues and organs are generated from stem cells .
[RESULTS] To further explore the role of the Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in NIC-induced ISC expansion , ISCs were cultured with NIC in the presence of either K-975 , a specific inhibitor of transcriptional enhanced associate domain ( TEAD ) , which binds to its transcriptional co-activators YAP or TAZ and forms a transcription complex , or γ-secretase inhibitor MK-0752 that inhibits the cleavage of Notch into its active signaling effector , Notch intracellular domain ( NICD ) . Histological analyses of the small intestine in C57BL/6 mice treated with 200 μg/ml NIC ( which emulates active smoking ) revealed that NIC exposure decreased villus length without affecting crypt size ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1A ) , which was consistent with NIC-induced decrease
[DISCUSSION] In contrast , our analysis validates that NIC affects ISC rather than Panth cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling activated though nAchRa7 by mRNA and protein analyses of sorted ISCs or Paneth cells and ex vivo functional assays . Similarly , the expression of target proteins ( Sox9 , TCF4 and , C-myc ) of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as well as cell-cycle regulatory proteins , such as cyclin B , and cyclin E , was up-regulated in crypts obtained from NIC-treated mice in our experiment ( data not shown ) . As NIC effectively expands the ISC population through the upregulated α7-nAChR and the formation of the YAP/TAZ-Notch loop , we speculate these factors to be good therapeutic targets for treating NIC-induced colon cancer . Activated YAP/TAZ , which act downstream of Hippo signaling , translocate to the nucleus and induce the gene expression of Notch receptors and Notch ligands , and thus , Notch is a mediator of

They are responsible for the maintenance of the gut , and they are also responsible for repairing damaged tissues and organs , such as the colon . However , the mechanisms by which these cells respond to nicotine are not well understood . The main component of cigarette smoke is nicotine , which is a highly addictive substance that can cause cancer and other diseases . Cigarette smoke contains a wide range of compounds that are harmful to human health , including nicotine derivatives 4- ( methylnitrosamino ) -1- ( 3-pyridyl )-1-butanone ( NNK ) and N'-nitrosonornicotine ( NNN ) in the form of four-pyridinic acetylcholine receptors ( YAP ) that control the growth of tumors in the intestinal epithelium . Previous studies indicate that cigarette smoking is significantly associated with colon cancer and mortality in humans and animal models . Moreover , cigarette smokers have emerged as a potential major risk factor associated with cancer , along with metabolic risk factors such as diet and obesity . Therefore , it is important to understand the mechanism by which stem cells react to nicotine . To do this , Wang et al . studied the effects of dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) on intestinal stem cells in mice . These mice were grown in a laboratory and then grown in the presence of a drug called dibenzazole . This drug inhibited the activity of ISC cells in the mice , but the effects were not observed in the paneth cells . Furthermore , these mice were not able to grow tumors despite the drug . Wang "

[ABSTRACT] Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones : J-domain proteins ( JDPs ) and nucleotide exchange factors ( NEFs ) . The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surface , which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones . Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation , but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum . Here , we elucidate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing . Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif . We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation , determining its final efficacy . Thus , balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential . Hsp70 is a key cellular system counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation , associated with stress , ageing , and disease . Furthermore , we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction .
[INTRODUCTION] Recent studies on the human system revealed that Hsp110 function in disaggregation of amyloid fibrils is not limited to its NEF activity but it may also affect the architecture of chaperone complexes , inducing Hsp70 clustering , although it is not clear whether similar effects occur during disaggregation of non-fibrillar , stress-associated aggregates . Hsp110 is a major cytoplasmic NEF of Hsp70 and the deletion of its both paralogs , SSE1 and SSE2 , is lethal and the growth can only be supported , albeit with less efficacy , by overexpression of FES1 , another cytoplasmic NEF from an unrelated armadillo family . To refold proteins from aggregates into their native state , eukaryotes use a system comprising Hsp70 , an ATP-dependent chaperone , and its co-chaperones : an Hsp110 nucleotide exchange factor ( NEF ) and a J-domain protein ( JDP/Hsp40 ) , together with an Hsp100 disaggregase . Here , we demonstrate that the interplay between Hsp110 and Hsp70 in disaggregation strictly relies on the class of a JDP and unravel the critical role of the B-class-specific interaction with the EEVD motif of Hsp70 for the Hsp110-dependent stimulation . The effect is not well understood , but it presumably increases entropic pulling of aggregated polypeptides , ultimately leading to their disentanglement by the Hsp70 system , efficient even without the Hsp100 disaggregase . The process is initiated by a JDP , which delivers Hsp70 to an aggregated substrate and whose J-domain induces ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70 , resulting in conformational changes that stabilise the interaction with aggregates . We employ biolayer interferometry ( BLI ) to investigate the Hsp110 impact on the formation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface and we assess changes in aggregates ' properties associated with the abundant chaperone binding . Despite the vast knowledge on how Hsp110 serves as a regulator of the ATPase cycle of Hsp70 , little is known about the function of Hsp110 considering the mechanism of Hsp70 interaction with different JDP classes . In vivo studies on yeast chaperones demonstrated that the Hsp110 co-chaperone Sse1 plays a key role in Hsp70 recruitment to aggregates and is essential for protein disaggregation . The importance of Hsp110 is also manifested in vitro in the low disaggregation activity of the yeast Hsp70 system without Hsp110 and the complete interdependence between their human
[RESULTS] To establish whether the inhibition that occurs at higher Sse1 concentrations is directly associated with the interaction between Sse1 and Ssa1 , or rather between Sse1 and a substrate , we used the previously characterised Sse1-2 variant ( N572Y E575A ) , with disrupted interaction with the A300 residue of Ssa1 , which reduces Hsp70 binding to 20 % and nucleotide exchange to 5 % of that of the wild type ( WT ) . In contrast to protein disaggregation , the reactivation of denatured , non-aggregated luciferase by Ssa1 with either Sis1 or Ydj1 was only negatively affected across a range of Sse1 concentrations ( Figure 3C ) , suggesting that the positive contribution of Hsp110 takes place before polypeptides
[DISCUSSION] The susceptibility to the NEF depends on the phase of the process and the composition of the Hsp70 system ( Figure 3A-D , Figure 3-figure supplement 1A ) , which may explain the discrepancies between different studies of Hsp110 's impact on disaggregation As well established , the most effective is sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 proportion to Hsp70 which corresponds with the physiological conditions , where the ratio between all cytoplasmic Hsp70 and Hsp110 paralogs involved in disaggregation ranges from approximately 10:1 . We propose that the local extraction of polypeptides by Hsp70-JDPB-Hsp110 , which penetrates the surface and takes apart amorphous aggregates , although not enough for full protein recovery , could successfully generate more manageable substrates for chaperones , as we demonstrated by applying the derepressed Hsp104 variant ( Figures 2A and 5 ) . While the s-shaped Ssa1-Sis1 binding to the aggregate results in the association of more Ssa1 than with Ydj1 ( Figure 1-figure supplement 2A

After 15 min of incubation at 55°C , the biosensor was equilibrated with the buffer A supplemented with 5 mM ATP and 2 mM DTT , reaching",,957,96,None,"Proteins are made up of many different molecules , including amino acids , proteins , and lipids . Each of these molecules is made of a protein called Hsp70 , which is a chaperone that helps the protein to fold into its native state . The HSP70 system is able to refold proteins into their native states , but it is not clear how this process works . To do this , the HSP110 system relies on two proteins: a J-domain protein and a nucleotide exchange factor ( NEF ) . Both proteins work together to form a complex that binds to the aggregated protein . When the NEF interacts with the HSPAN protein , it triggers a chemical reaction called ATPase . This chemical reaction causes the aggregates to become smaller , making them easier to disassemble . However , if the JDP and NEF do not work together , then the aggregate will be disassembled . It is not known how HsP70 works , or how it affects the structure of the aggregate . In this study , Wang et al . used biolayer interferometry to investigate the role of Hspina , an enzyme that helps to disassemble proteins . They found that the Hspana molecule interacts more strongly with the J domain protein than with the NSF , suggesting that the interaction between the Jdomain and NSF is important for the HspaN protein to work properly . Wang also showed that the interactions between the two proteins are important for Hspasin , as they help to disaggregate proteins into smaller species . These findings suggest that Hsparin is important in the process of disaggregation , because it helps to"

[ABSTRACT] This work provides a framework for a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods , adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding wearable technology analytical pipelines , and supports clinical development of at-home gait assessments , with the potential to improve the ease , frequency , and depth of patient monitoring . After showing that digital insole-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional gait measurements , we next showed that a single stride of raw sensor time-series data could be accurately assigned to each subject , highlighting that individuals using digital insoles can be identified by their gait characteristics . However , clinical gait analysis relies on subjective visual observation of walking as objective gait analysis has not been possible within clinical settings due to the expensive equipment , large-scale facilities , and highly trained staff required . To achieve this , we constructed a machine learning model , trained on force plate data collected in participants with knee arthropathy and controls . In this work , we demonstrate how a digital insole measuring osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures yields similar results to the clinical gait-lab standard . This model was highly predictive of force plate data from a validation set ( area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [ auROC ] = 0 . Gait analysis is used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and monitor disease progression or intervention response . 90 ) and of a separate , independent digital insole dataset containing control and knee osteoarthritis subjects ( auROC = 0 . Relatively low-cost wearable digital insoles may offer a solution to these challenges . Gait is impaired in musculoskeletal conditions , such as knee arthropathy . 86 ; area under the precision-recall curve [ auPR ] = 0 . 83 ; auPR = 0 . 86 ) .
[INTRODUCTION] We also aimed to clinically validate the measurement of gait with digital insoles in those with knee arthropathy through ( 1 ) development of a novel ML framework ( based on 'gold-standard ' force plate data ) for application within digital insoles to detect knee arthropathy status and ( 2 ) processed digital insole-derived gait outcomes and raw sensor signals to identify disease-specific gait patterns in knee arthroscopy . However , clinical application of wearable digital insoles for gait analysis in knee OA is limited by a paucity of analytical validation data ( including face , criterion , and construct validity ) , such as comparison of gait outcome measures in those with knee OA to 'gold-standard ' laboratory references ( e. g. , force plate outcomes ) . For example , deep learning models are better suited to handle high-throughput , multimodal data streams , such as raw sensor time series , but typically require larger datasets than classical statistical or ML methods ( in terms of both features and sample size ) . Wearable sensors offer an alternative approach to assessment of gait in those with knee OA as they can be deployed within any environment or setting , are relatively low-cost , and can provide outcomes automatically without the need for highly experienced or trained staff . Recently , there is interest in developing more streamlined ( 'light-weight ' ) gait algorithms and data processing pipelines using machine learning ( ML ) to automate and process large volumes of novel digital data obtained from wearable devices . Collectively , both data type , size , and model selection are key components of a comprehensive wearable sensor data analysis pipeline and should be considered when evaluating clinical research pipelines with large heterogeneous datasets . Technological development has led to digital insoles ( wearables ) that can capture vGRF and other gait characteristics that are relevant to knee OA assessment , which could be used within free-living environments . This study aimed to assess the face validity of measuring vGRF using digital insoles compared to the standard laboratory reference of force plates in control adults and
[RESULTS] To investigate how the variation in the vGRF data may be partially explained by the clinical and demographic characteristics of the participants , we fit a series of linear models to each point along the vGRF curve , with arthropathy state ( knee arthropathy or control ) , age , sex ( male or female ) , and body weight as covariates in the model ( Figure 2-figure supplement 2 ) . For derived gait characteristics , we wanted to understand whether aspects of gait other than walking speed could be used to correctly classify whether a subject had knee OA relative to a control as this would suggest potential for
[DISCUSSION] In addition , the finding that our models can identify individual gait patterns suggests that data generated from a digital insole may have unforeseen future applications such as the potential to detect changes in individual gait patterns , which may provide better understanding of the impact of a therapeutic intervention for that individual . The study 's analytical approach , which focused solely on regular walking patterns and excluded outliers and irregular patterns in the insole gait data , may limit the comprehensiveness of the findings ; future research should aim to collect more diverse walking data per subject to include nonregular patterns . Additionally , the insoles are currently only capable of providing vGRF outcome measures , but medial and lateral GRF would also be useful outcomes for OA as these also relate to pain and OA severity . Ultimately , this work
[METHODS] Eligible participants were men and women ≥40 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of OA of the knee based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria with radiological evidence of OA ( Kellgren-Lawrence score ≥ 2 ) at the index knee joint as well as pain score of ≥4 in Western Ontario and McMaster",,998,98,None,"Gait analysis is a technique used to assess the gait of people with musculoskeletal conditions , such as knee arthropathy . This is done by measuring the movements of the joints , muscles , and bones . However , it is difficult to do this in clinical settings due to the high cost of equipment , large-scale facilities and highly trained staff required . The use of wearable sensors to measure gait in those with knee OA is becoming increasingly common . These sensors can be used to measure the movement of the feet , legs , arms , or other parts of the body . In addition , these sensors can also be used for other tasks such as walking , e . g . to monitor the strength of the muscles in the knees . It is not clear how these sensors could be used in a clinical setting , but it is possible to develop a new approach to measuring gait . To do this , researchers need to be able to use a device called a digital insole to measure a person’s gait using a computer program . A computer program called machine learning can then analyze the data from the insoles , which can then be used as a tool to develop new gait analysis methods . Now , Wang et al . have developed a computational model that can be applied to a large number of subjects , including those with a condition called osteoarthritis and those with an arthritic knee . They then used the model to study the gaits of participants with the condition . Wang "

[ABSTRACT] Mechanistically , HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons , suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief . We further purified the major matrix component , the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO . Local application of Clarix Flo ( FLO ) , a human amniotic membrane ( AM ) product , attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice . Collectively , our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain . This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways . Moreover , we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 . Therefore , there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain . HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition . Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death . Pain after surgery causes significant suffering .
[INTRODUCTION] The natural process of HC-HA/PTX3 formation may involve : Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 protein covalently binds to HC1 of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor and then transfers it to high-molecular-weight hyaluronan ( HMW-HA ) . FLO ( Clarix Flo ; BioTissue , Miami , FL ) is a sterile , micronized , and lyophilized form of human AM/UC matrix used for surgical and non-surgical repair , reconstruction , or replacement of soft tissue by filling in the connective tissue void . An optimal strategy would be to develop local treatments that both inhibit pain and address the underlying pathophysiology , such as neuronal sensitization while avoiding the central side effects of commonly used analgesics . In a plantar-incision mouse model of post-surgical pain , we first explored whether FLO may be deployed as a viable biologic for the treatment of trauma pain . We hence investigated whether HC-HA/PTX3 is a key bioactive component mediating the pain relief effects of FLO and further examined its mode of action . HC-HA/PTX3 was recently shown to alleviate dry eye disease induced by chronic graft-versus-host disease by suppressing inflammation and scarring in murine lacrimal glands . Our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain . Continuous reliance on opioid analgesics causes severe side effects and accidental death , which resulted in a national public health emergency being declared in 2017 . A naturally occurring biologic derived from human birth tissues has recently gained our attention as a potential solution for this challenging problem . The birth tissue is predominantly comprised of the amniotic membrane ( AM ) and umbilical cord ( UC ) , which share the same cell origin as the fetus . We then purified the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ) , which is in uniquely high amounts in human AM . Intriguingly , FLO also appears to relieve pain effectively in several ocular surface disorders , and musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis and lower extremity neuropathy . However , the mechanisms underlying its potential pain-inhibitory properties and how it may affect sensory neuron excitability remain unknown . Accordingly , there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid alternative therapies for managing post-surgical/post-operative pain . They have been shown to orchestrate regenerative healing within its anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring properties in ophthalmic applications . Moreover , we
[RESULTS] Although HC-HA-PTX3 still increased the translocation of F-actin and CD44 to the cell membrane in both siAnk and siERM groups , the extent was significantly less than that in the siNT control group ( Figure 5-figure supplement 2A , B ) , suggesting that both Ankyrin and ERM signaling may partly contribute to HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement . Consistent with this finding , analysis of our recently published single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) dataset of mouse DRG showed high expression levels of CD44 in nociceptive neuronal clusters , but much lower expression in large neuronal clusters which are Aβ or Aδ low-threshold mechanoreceptors or proprioceptors , and in C-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors ( c-LTMRs , Figure 4B ) . Using in vivo calcium imaging of DRG
[DISCUSSION] It induced an acute cytoskeleton rearrangement and inhibition of INav and HVA-Ica currents in a CD44-dependent manner , making it a promising non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain . Nevertheless , translation of preclinical findings into clinical treatments is complex and often challenging due to species differences and the intricate nature of pain etiology in patients . Our findings provide an important rational for future clinical trials to validate the utility of FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 for post-surgical pain control . Our study suggests that human birth tissue products may be deployed as a viable biologic to treat post-surgical pain . We further identified HC-HA/PTX3 as the primary bioactive component responsible for pain inhibition .
[METHODS] Lumbar DRGs from 4-week-old WT mice and CD44 KO mice ( both sexes ) were collected in cold DH10 ( 90 % Dulbecco 's Modified Eagle Medium [ DMEM ] /F-12 , 10 % fetal bovine serum , penicillin [ 100 U/ml ] , and streptomycin [ 100 μg/ml ] [ Invitrogen ] ) and treated with enzyme solution ( dispase",,916,94,None,"When a person undergoes surgery , they often experience pain in their eyes or other parts of the body . This pain can be caused by a variety of factors , including the presence of a drug called opioid . Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and death in some cases . However , it is not clear how these side effects are caused . The human amniotic membrane ( AM ) and umbilical cord ( UC ) are made from the same tissue as the fetus . AM contains a protein called HC-HA/PTX3 , which is found in many different types of human AM . It is also known to be toxic to animals , but it has been shown that it can be used as an alternative to opioids for treating pain after surgery . Now , Wang et al . have used a mouse model of post-surgical pain to study the effects of Clarix Flo on the nociceptive dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons . These neurons are located in the dorsum of the eye , and are responsible for making the nerves relax . In the mouse model , FLO was applied to the DRG neurons , where it inhibited the activity of the opioid receptors , causing them to stop responding to the opioids . Furthermore , the mice were able to see the effect of FLO on these neurons without experiencing any side effects of opioids or other drugs . Wang also found that FLO could be used to treat other disorders such as dry eye disease , osteoarthritis and lower extremity neuropathy . Therefore , there is an urgent need to develop alternative therapies for managing post-surgery pain ."

[ABSTRACT] We reasoned this by less correlation between the actual color and the gene expressions that directly define the level of pigmentation , from which we hypothesized the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition not strongly indicating the functional characteristics of the RPE . To know whether their color in appearance is correlated with the function of the RPE , we analyzed the color intensities of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells ( iPSC-RPE ) together with the gene expression profile at the single-cell level . For this purpose , we utilized our recent invention , Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System ( ALPS ) , which enabled photographing each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell . While our iPSC-RPE were categorized into four clusters by gene expression , the color intensity of iPSC-RPE did not project any specific gene expression profiles . Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells show heterogeneous levels of pigmentation when cultured in vitro .
[INTRODUCTION] RPE cells play an important role in maintaining the visual system by supplying nutrition to the photoreceptors , phagocytosing mature outer segments of the photoreceptors , facilitating visual/retinoid cycle to produce a photosensitive derivative of vitamin A , absorbing stray light for the vision , and secreting vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) for the maintenance of choroid blood vessels . For quality management of iPSC-RPE transplants , we routinely verify the expressions of key factors such as RPE65 , Bestrophin , CRALBP , and MERTK by quantitative PCR ; PAX6 and microphthalmia transcription factor ( MiTF ) by immunostaining ; and pigment epithelium-derived factor glycoprotein ( PEDF ) and VEGF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . In the present study , we utilized this system to monitor the color of iPSC-RPE cells , then to pick up one of the cells , followed by RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of that single-cell . We found the genes that define pigmentation itself had less correlation with the color , suggesting the color in appearance is a temporal condition that does not directly represent the function of the RPE . Abnormalities in the RPE cause a wide variety of retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) which is a devastating disease leading to blindness . The morphology and pigmentation are also qualitatively checked , but there has been no means to link these appearances with gene expression . Our laboratory has pioneered in the production of RPE cells from iPSC and ocular transplantation of iPSC-derived RPE cells ( iPSC-RPE ) to replace degenerated RPE of AMD patients . In this way , we concluded the color of iPSC-RPE cells did not project any specific gene expression profile . RPE is a layer of cells paved by hexagonal , brown-pigmented cells , which locates between the neural retina and the choroid . While monitoring the cells in live , ALPS enables to pick up one single-cell for further manipulation . Medication for AMD is limited , and there are increasing attention on cell transplantation of RPE for the treatment . Our recent invention , ALPS , enables the characterization of a cell that is actually showing a behavior of interest . RPE transplantation for AMD to replace degenerated RPE with fetal RPE was introduced almost three decades ago . We reasoned this by
[RESULTS] To characterize the cells with different degrees of pigmentation , 2304 cells of iPSC-RPE ( 96 cells each from two different dishes of 12 independent cultures of iPSC201B7-RPE and iPSC253G1-RPE cultured for 6 and 12 weeks ; Figure 1-source data 1 ) were photographed under a light microscope ( Figure 1B photos ) and picked as single-cells by ALPS . Although the parameters for t‐SNE were adjusted to have all the iPSC-RPEs ( iPSC201B7-RPE and iPSC253G1-RPE cultured for 6 and 12 weeks ; Figure 1-source data 1 ) mingle regardless of the original iPSC-line or the culture period ( Figure 2A ) , our iPSC-RPE was divided in four sub-clusters ( Figure 2B ) . To compare the gene expression profiles of our iPSC-RPE
[DISCUSSION] When stem cell-derived RPE cells are cultured in vitro , they are apparently not pigmented at sparse density , probably due to dilution amongst daughter cells or secretion of melanin by the fusion of melanosome membrane to the plasma membrane as proposed in melanocytes , but they become pigmented when they form a confluent monolayer , which is a reversible effect as the dynamics of pigmentation repeats when they are re-plated at a sparse density and become confluent again ( Figure 3-figure supplement 1 ) . In this study , we showed the degree of pigmentation of in vitro cultured iPSC-RPE cells did not project specific gene ontological clusters , although it correlated to some extent with the expressions of functional genes of the RPE , such as complement- and lysosome-related genes . For example , bone marrow-derived RPE cells that are poorly pigmented in vitro become highly pigmented when transplanted , as well as our iPSC-RPE cells that are not pigmented
[METHODS] For the picked single cells , library preparation including cell lysis , RNA fragmentation , cDNA generation with molecular barcode attachment , amplification , and purification was performed using the Bravo NGS workstation ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) and thermal cyclers ( Mastercycler X50s ; Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) . To estimate the RGB values",,942,95,None,"Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) is a layer of cells that surrounds the retina . It is made up of cells called hexagonal cells , which are shaped like a hexagon . The cells are able to produce a protein called vitamin A , and they also help to absorb light from the surrounding environment . However , it is not clear how these cells work . To find out if the RPE cells are working properly , researchers have developed a technique called automated live imaging and cell picking system . This system allows researchers to monitor the color of the cells in real time , then to pick up one of them . In this way , the researchers can determine whether the cells are actually producing a specific type of pigment . For example , if a single cell has a different color than the other cell , they can identify the genes that make up the pigment , but not the gene that makes it . Now , Wang et al . have used this technique to study the pigmentation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cells ( iPSC-RPE cells ) . These cells were grown in a laboratory and then picked up by a microscope . They were then analyzed by RNA sequencing , followed by DNA sequencing . Wang , Zhang ed . , showed that the pigment intensity of i PSC-rPE cells was not correlated with the level of pigmentation , suggesting that the color in appearance is not a temporal condition that does not directly represent the function of the REP cells ."

[ABSTRACT] MarmoAAP addresses the limitations of traditional behavioral research methods by enabling high-throughput , detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings , allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting . This new apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations , paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism . In recent years , the field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms . The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) , due to its small size , prosocial nature , and genetic proximity to humans , has emerged as a pivotal model toward this effort . To address this critical gap , we developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling ( MarmoAAP ) , a novel behavioral apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets . We also highlight the flexibility of MarmoAAP in task parameter manipulation which accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual animal capabilities . However , traditional research methodologies often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors . MarmoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes . Furthermore , MarmoAAP provides a platform to perform investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors .
[INTRODUCTION] Marmosets provide notable advantages as research models , including their immediate relevance to humans given their genetic relatedness and shared dominant sensory modalities , and their small size which facilitates naturalistic , freely moving studies of primate social behaviors that can be challenging with larger species like macaques . Recent studies have explored alternative cooperative tasks to address some of these limitations , including the work by Jiang et al. , 2021 , which demonstrated the potential of using a nose-poking task to study cooperation in mice , rats , and tree shrews . Building upon this work , we aimed to develop a task that not only captures the nuances of cooperative behaviors but also allows for high-resolution data collection , making it more suitable for investigating the underlying neural mechanisms in primates . While the cooperative pulling paradigm has been invaluable in shedding light on cooperative behaviors across a variety of species , it presents several limitations that hinder its utility for investigating complex behavioral dynamics and preclude studies of underlying neural mechanisms . Given the theorized role of cooperation in the evolution of higher-order cognitive processes involving processing and engaging in social interactions , studying this behavior can have important implications for understanding social dynamics , communication , and cognition in the animal kingdom . Marmosets provide a unique opportunity to investigate social behavioral dynamics , however , being a relatively new model in the field of neuroscience , they have yet to benefit from the extensive methodological developments available for other model organisms like rodents . With the rapid advancements in methods for recording and manipulating neural activity from these species , there arises a critical need to modernize our approaches to studying animal behavior to ensure they keep pace with the evolving neural techniques . Indeed , marmosets consistently show more socio-cognitively advanced behaviors such as social learning , vocal communication , understanding and use of gaze cues , and cooperative problem-solving relative to non-cooperatively breeding primates . This time-consuming process not only disrupts the natural behaviors of the animals but also limits the number of trials that can be conducted in each session , often allowing for only a meager sample size . We demonstrate its utility in
[RESULTS] To validate this application of MarmoAAP , we conducted wireless neural recordings using a silicon-based linear array probe while a marmoset engaged in the cooperative pulling task with its partner ( Figure 3A ) and were able to isolate single-unit activity from the prefrontal cortex ( Figure 3B ) . The highly reproducible lever-pulling behavior in marmosets within a naturalistic context strikes a crucial balance between conventional laboratory tests , where monkeys are immobilized and tasks lack natural movement but are tightly controlled , and more naturalistic animal behavior studies , where animals exhibit unrestrained behavior but lack regular behavioral benchmarks for studying the underlying neural dynamics . By incorporating these behavioral metrics from video and
[DISCUSSION] One key modification would involve adjusting the size of the servo motor and the lever , as the current setup is tailored to small animals like marmosets , which can be trained to exert a pulling force of approximately 500-600 g. For larger animals , incorporating a larger motor capable of exerting greater force , along with more durable parts , would be recommended . This task design strikes a pivotal balance between traditional naturalistic animal behavior studies , which benefit from a high degree of naturalism but often suffer from low behavioral resolution and limited trial counts , and conventional lab studies , which are highly controlled but lack natural ethological relevance . While our study demonstrates a considerable increase in trial throughput using the automated apparatus , with marmosets completing an average of 146 trials per 20 min session , it is important to note that not all of
[METHODS] Once comfortable in the testing room , marmosets were habituated to the transparent behavior boxes ( Figure 1A ) and trained to pull the levers ( Figure 1A ) on the apparatus in exchange for a liquid reward ( marshmallow fluff diluted with water ; 6 g marshmallow fluff per 20 ml water ) . After the",,976,97,None,"Many animals live in natural environments , where they can interact with other animals and interact with humans . However , these environments are often difficult to study because of the large number of animals that live in these environments . The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) is an example of a primate that has emerged as a model organism for studying social behavior . Its small size , prosocial nature , and genetic proximity to humans have made it an ideal model for studying animal behavior in nature . In recent years , the field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms . To address this gap , Weiss et al . developed a new behavioral apparatus called MarmoAAP , which can be used to study cooperative behaviors in common mammalian species . This apparatus allows researchers to record and manipulate neural activity in the brain of the marmosene monkey , Callithlrix . These recordings can be combined with video and audio recordings , allowing for more detailed and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting . MarmaAAP also allows researchers from other species to perform tasks that are not normally performed in laboratory settings . For example , weiss’ experiments show that the Marmosetes are able to pull levers on their partners , while the monkeys are unable to pull a lever on its partner . Furthermore , our experiments reveal that MarmiAAP can be integrated with other behavioral tools , such as video or audio recording , to allow researchers to investigate the neural mechanisms that underlie social behavior in other animals . Future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using Marmomets as models will help to better understand how animals interact with each other"

[ABSTRACT] Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology , intelligence , educational attainment , autism , and schizophrenia . Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions . Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific , with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation . In our murine model , a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation . We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE ) resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans . DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation . Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates . Alcohol consumption in pregnancy can affect genome regulation in the developing offspring but results have been contradictory .
[INTRODUCTION] Choline , in particular , has been explored in several clinical trials to reduce cognitive deficits caused by PAE in affected individuals , or when administered during pregnancy , with results suggesting a high methyl donor ( HMD ) diet could at least partially mitigate the adverse effects of PAE on various behavioural outcomes . We employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing ( WGBS ) for unbiased assessment of CpG DNA methylation in newborn brain and liver , two target organs affected by ethanol , to explore tissue specificity of effects and to determine any 'tissue agnostic ' effects which may have arisen prior to the germ layers separating in early gastrulation . Whether prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE ) is sufficient to induce overt physiological abnormalities depends on multiple environmental and genetic factors including the dose and timing of alcohol use during pregnancy , maternal diet , smoking , stress , and potentially other factors that collectively influence fetal outcomes . Patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy vary , but epidemiological surveys suggest most women in Western countries consume low to moderate levels between conception until recognition of pregnancy , after which time consumption largely ceases , apart from occasional use . Methylation of DNA can alter chromatin density and influence patterns of gene expression in a tissue-specific and developmentally appropriate manner and disruption to this process may cause some of the difficulties experienced by people with FASD . While the effects of binge levels of exposure are well documented as able to cause FASD , more subtle effects that reflect the more common patterns of drinking are unclear and more research is needed to support public health initiatives to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnancy . Given the lack of clarity around the effects of typical patterns of alcohol consumption , which often do not cause observable phenotypes , we conducted an epigenome-wide association study of early moderate PAE in mice . The study was a controlled intervention investigating the impact of early moderate PAE on offspring DNA methylation comparing exposed and unexposed mice , with an additional arm comparing the effect of alcohol exposure in the context of an HMD maternal diet . Our study provides cogent evidence that common patterns of drinking can have measurable effects on fetal gene regulation , highlighting a role for
[RESULTS] The trajectory of weight gain during pregnancy was similar across all treatment groups with some evidence of more rapid weight gain in the HMD groups in the last 2 days , although the total amount of weight gained between days 1 and 17-19 was not significantly different between treatment groups by linear mixed effects regression ( Figure 2a and b ) . Remaining littermates from each treatment group were reared to adulthood and underwent behavioural testing assessing various neurocognitive domains that can be affected in FASD including locomotor activity , anxiety , spatial recognition , memory , motor coordination , and balance . We performed differential testing on a total of 1898 CpG sites that corresponded to mouse DMRs ,
[DISCUSSION] It is remarkable that some associations identified in our murine model of early moderate exposure were recapitulated in human subjects with FASD despite species and biosample differences , suggesting that at least some DNA methylation changes are stable over time . In conclusion , this study demonstrates that early moderate PAE can disturb fetal genome regulation in mice and humans and supports current public health advice that alcohol consumption during pregnancy , even at low doses , may be harmful . Notably , PEX12 is associated with Zellweger syndrome , which is a rare peroxisome biogenesis disorder ( the most severe variant of peroxisome biogenesis disorder spectrum ) , characterised by neuronal migration defects in the brain , dysmorphic craniofacial features , profound hypotonia , neonatal seizures , and liver dysfunction . Although a plausible alternative explanation is that some of the PAE regions were not reproduced in the set of mice given the folate diet
[METHODS] Littermates who were not sacrificed at birth were reared on normal chow and drinking water ad libitum until adulthood ( ~8 weeks after birth ) when they underwent behavioural tests assessing five neurodevelopmental domains that can be affected by PAE including locomotor activity , anxiety , spatial recognition , memory , motor coordination , and balance . Pregnant dams",,962,96,None,"During pregnancy , women often drink alcohol in the form of a binge of alcohol . This can lead to a variety of health problems , including alcohol-related brain damage , autism , and schizophrenia . Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can affect many aspects of the development of the baby , but it is not clear how this affects the developing baby . In some cases , people with alcohol spectrum disorder ( FASD ) have a genetic disorder that affects genes that control how they develop . However , it is unclear how alcohol consumption affects these genes , or how it affects their development . To address this question , Wei et al . used a mouse model of prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE ) to study the effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation in newborn pups . The results showed that early PAE was sufficient to affect DNA resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in humans . These changes were mostly tissue-specific , with some of the changes likely originating as early as gastrulation . Early PAE could also affect DNA sequences in the brain and liver , which could be affected by the presence of ethanol . Our results suggest that early moderate alcohol exposure can have measurable effects on the fetal genome , even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes . Further research is needed to support public health initiatives to reduce alcohol intake during pregnancy . For example , a high methyl donor diet could at least partially mitigate some of these effects ."

[ABSTRACT] Quantitative models and their exploratory simulations led us to find that ( 1 ) changing cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3 , ( 2 ) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells , and ( 3 ) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides , which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs , are enriched within 'pUG zones ' matching the dsRNA . In this network , the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10 , the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16 , and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene , but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene , where only the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing . Here , we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism . Since double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) is effective for silencing a wide variety of genes , all genes are typically considered equivalent targets for such RNA interference ( RNAi ) . Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs . Yet , loss of some regulators of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can selectively impair the silencing of some genes .
[INTRODUCTION] After recognition by RDE-1-bound siRNAs , the target mRNAs are cleaved and the 5′ fragments are stabilized through the addition of 3′ UG-dinucleotide repeats by the nucleotidyltransferase RDE-3 to form pUG RNAs , which act as templates for the amplification of 2° siRNAs by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases . The primary Argonaute protein RDE-1 cleaves one strand of the smaller dsRNA and associates with the other , making it a 1° short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) that can guide the recognition of target mRNAs of complementary sequence ( siRNAs ; processing , pink ) . Insights from modeling led us to discover the influence of cis-regulatory regions on the requirements for RNAi , the recovery of animals from RNAi within non-dividing cells , and a dearth of pUG RNA production by 2° siRNAs . While a dsRNA-based drug can be designed using just the mRNA sequence of any target gene , the intracellular effectiveness of the drug and the ease with which an organism could escape the drug by developing resistance are difficult to predict . These differences can be explained by differences in the thresholds for silencing the two genes using an intersecting network of regulators but not by parallel pathways of regulation after primary mRNA recognition . Extensive characterization of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans makes it a suitable system to examine how differences between target genes and reliance on specific regulators contribute to efficacy and resistance . Although it is difficult to compare the silencing of two different genes by controlling all relevant variables , past studies have highlighted gene-specific differences in the efficacy of RNAi under different conditions . The requirement for NRDE-3 but not for MUT-16 or RDE-10 can be bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA , suggesting that loss of NRDE-3 has the least impact on the efficiency of silencing . These 2° siRNAs are bound by one of several Argonautes , resulting in the eventual degradation of target mRNAs in the cytoplasm , which requires a cytoplasmic Argonaute , and/or co-transcriptional silencing of the target gene in the nucleus , which requires a nuclear Argonaute . Understanding the sources of such differences and the underlying mechanisms will improve our ability to design efficacious dsRNA drugs that are difficult to evade through the
[RESULTS] For such an intersecting network with quantitative contributions by multiple regulators of RNAi to explain the silencing of somatic targets , including targets like unc-22 and bli-1 that show dramatic differences , it should be possible to identify values for the relative contributions of each regulatory path ( Nm = from MUT-16 to NRDE-3 , Nr = from RDE-10 to NRDE-3 , Om = from MUT-16 to other Argonautes , and Or = from RDE-10 to other Argonautes in Figure 2C , left ) and for gene-specific thresholds ( Tbli-1 = level of BLI-1 function below which a defect is detectable , and Tunc-22 = level of UNC-22 function below which a defect is detectable ) that are
[DISCUSSION] Therefore , we propose that the production of 22G RNAs in response to the addition of dsRNA occurs as follows : ( 1 ) non-processive RdRPs make a heterogenous mixture of short RNAs , ( 2 ) 2° Argonautes bind the 5′ end of these pre-secondary siRNA , and ( 3 ) RDE-10 and/or associated protein ( s ) remove excess 3′ sequence to generate 22-nt siRNAs that are effectively retained by the mature siRNA-Argonaute complex . Current models for the production of 26G RNAs propose that the RdRP RRF-3 transcribes long antisense RNA from internal C nucleotides on template mRNA , the phosphatase PIR-1 converts the 5′ triphosphate of the RdRP product into 5′ mono phosphate , the template is then trimmed by the 3′-5′ exonuclease ERI-1 to generate a blunt-ended dsRNA , which is then cleaved by DCR-1 to generate the mature 26G RNAs that are bound by the Argonaute ERGO-1 .
[METHODS] This screen was performed by mutagenizing a strain ( AMJ174 ) with the transgene T ( oxSi487 [ mex-5p : :mCherry : :H2B : :tbb-2 3′UTR : :gpd-2 operon : :GFP : :H2B : :cye-1 3′UTR +unc-119 ( + ) ] , Devanapally et al. , 2021 ) silenced for > 200 generations after introducing a mutation in",,976,97,None,"Cells are made up of many different types of cells , and each cell has a unique set of genes . Each gene is regulated by a set of proteins called RNA molecules , which are then transcribed into a protein called a molecule called double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) . The RNA molecule is a type of molecule that can be used to block the activity of a specific gene , but it is not clear how a gene can be regulated . In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , the RNA is produced by two different proteins . One of these proteins , called RDE-1 , cleaves one strand of the mRNA and associates with the other , making it a 1° short interfering RNA that is used to amplify a small RNA called pUG . RDE-3 , however , is not required for the pUL RNA to be amplification . Instead , it is required for a second protein , MUT-16 , to cleave a smaller RNA from a single strand . These two proteins work together so that any two are required for silencing one gene but each is singly required for another gene . However , this is not the case for the two proteins whose RNAs are asymmetric , as they are unable to bind to each other . This is because the two genes have different levels of RNA processing . For example , when a new gene is added to a double strand in a cell , only one of the two strands of drRNA is required . To overcome this , an enzyme called NRDE"

[ABSTRACT] We aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality , and determine the best predictors of death , utilizing whole-blood RNA sequencing from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM , 295 pulmonary tuberculosis ( PTB ) , and 30 healthy controls . These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB , highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death , offering insights for potential therapeutic targets alongside a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes . Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis , we identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality , with a consensus analysis revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals . Mortality and morbidity from tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) are common , primarily due to inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection , yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood . We employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death , then logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose best predictors . Among HIV-positive individuals , mortality associated with increased angiogenesis , while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization . Four hub genes-MCEMP1 , NELL2 , ZNF354C , and CD4-were strong TBM mortality predictors . Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality .
[INTRODUCTION] Our objective was to use weighted gene co-expression network analysis , an unbiased and well-evaluated approach , to identify the biological pathways and hub genes associated with TBM pathogenesis and assess the predictive value of gene expression for early mortality from TBM . Taken together , these studies suggest the inflammatory response associated with TBM may have a greater systemic component than originally thought and its characterization may help define the immune mechanisms leading to death and disability . 1 million new tuberculosis ( TB ) cases in 2019 , tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) is estimated to have developed in 164 , 000 adults , around 25 % of whom were living with HIV . In the current study , we investigated whole blood RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) transcriptional profiles in 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM , 295 with pulmonary TB ( PTB ) , and 30 healthy controls . Host-based peripheral blood gene expression analysis has been used to identify active or progressive pulmonary TB and in pulmonary TB treatment monitoring , but has yet to be applied to TBM . The accurate and early detection of patients at highest risk of complications and death from TBM may help to target treatment for those most in need . The British Medical Research Council ( MRC ) grades have been used to categorize TBM severity for almost 80 years , and the system strongly predicts TBM mortality . Previously , we and others developed new prognostic models from studies of 1699 adults with TBM using clinical and laboratory parameters , including MRC grade . Studies have shown that immune cell counts , cytokine concentrations , metabolites and transcriptional responses differ between the peripheral blood and the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . Overall , TBM mortality is around 25 % , but rises to around 50 % in those with HIV , with most deaths occurring in the first 3 months of treatment . The poor outcomes from TBM are strongly associated with the inflammatory response , with both a paucity and an excess of inflammation linked to death from TBM . Blood transcriptomic analysis has found increased neutrophil-associated transcripts and inflammasome signaling in those with HIV-associated TBM and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome . In adults with TBM , leukocyte
[RESULTS] Ten hub genes associated with mortality ( CD96 , TNFRSF25 , TBC1D4 , CD28 , ABLIM1 , RASGRP1 , NELL2 , TRAF5 , TESPA1 , TRABD2A ) were from the brown module , three ( EVL , PLCG1 , NLRC3 ) from the red , and six ( CD2 , CD247 , TGFBR3 , ARL4C , KLRK1 , MATK ) from the black module ( Figure 5E-H ) . Similarly , associations of the modules with mortality were measured by hazard ratio ( HR ) per increase 1/10 unit of PC1 using Cox regression model adjusted for age , HIV status and dexamethasone treatment ( Figure 4 ) in both discovery and validation cohorts . To better understand the
[DISCUSSION] Our own earlier studies have also suggest a role for neutrophils in TBM pathogenesis , with high pretreatment CSF bacterial loads being correlated with high neutrophil numbers in both CSF and blood and more frequent new neurological events or paradoxical inflammatory complications . Whilst there appeared to be many common pathways involved in TBM mortality in HIV-positive and negative individuals , there were differences : death was associated with increased expression of angiogenesis genes in HIV-positive adults , and with TNF signaling and down regulated extracellular matrix organization in HIV-negative adults . This study investigated the pathways associated with death from TBM at a whole-genome transcriptome level in whole blood , characterizing a global dysregulation in immune responses , including inflammation , and revealing specific functional pathways and hub genes involved in TBM and the mechanisms leading to death . Therefore , the differences in gene expression associated with TBM mortality in the current

Considering the diverse",,971,97,None,"Tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis , a bacteria that can infect humans and animals . It is caused by a bacterium that causes a variety of diseases , including cancer , heart disease , and diabetes . TBM is the leading cause of death in the United States , with more than 1 million new cases in 2019 . However , the underlying mechanisms are not well understood . In addition to causing death , TBM can also lead to a number of other conditions , such as a lack of immune cells , which can lead to complications . One of the most common causes of death is the inflammatory response . The immune system responds to the infection by releasing a chemical called cytokines . These molecules are known as inflammatory mediators , but they are not thought to be involved in the development of the disease . Now , Wang et al . have used whole-blood RNA sequencing to identify genes and pathways that are associated with TBM mortality . This revealed that TBM causes an inflammatory reaction that is similar to PTB . Among HIV-positive individuals , death was associated with increased angiogenesis , while HIV-negative individuals showed increased TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization . Furthermore , four genes – MEMP1 , NELL2 , ZNF354C , CD4 , CEMP2 and CD4—were strong predictors of TBM death . Wang also found that HIV-infected individuals were more likely to die from TBM than those who were not . Together , these findings suggest that the immune response to TBM may have a greater systemic component than previously thought ."

[ABSTRACT] Side-by-side comparisons of all antibodies against each target , obtained from multiple commercial partners , have demonstrated that : ( i ) more than 50 % of all antibodies failed in one or more applications , ( ii ) yet , ~50-75 % of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody , depending on application , suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant ; and ( iii ) recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies . It is commonly understood that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets , but information on the scope of the problem remains largely anecdotal , and as such , feasibility of the goal of at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in a proteome can not be assessed . This first study helps demonstrate the scale of the antibody specificity problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome ; mine the existing commercial antibody repertoire , and use the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts . Focusing on antibodies for human proteins , we have scaled a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins . Encouragingly , more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers , and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market . The hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles , which should raise alarm . Antibodies are critical reagents to detect and characterize proteins .
[INTRODUCTION] With tens to hundreds of antibodies available for any given protein target , it is difficult for antibody users to select the best performing antibody , and a growing number of cases reveal that depending on previously published antibodies is not a reliable method to assess their performance . We sought to address this issue by developing optimized protocols to assess antibody specificity in the three most common uses of antibodies in biomedical research laboratories ; Western blot ( WB ) , immunoprecipitation ( IP ) , and immunofluorescence ( IF ) . We have tested 614 commercially available antibodies targeting 65 proteins , and found that approximately two thirds of this protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody , and half was covered by at least one high-performing renewable antibody , suggesting that coverage of human proteins by high-performing antibodies is significant . The optimal antibody testing methodology is largely settled ; using an appropriately selected wild type cell and an isogenic CRISPR knockout ( KO ) version of the same cell as the basis for testing , yields rigorous and broadly applicable results . Commercial antibody suppliers support a large and diverse catalogue of products , with most antibody products generating < $ 5000 in total sales , far less than the costs of KO-based validation , estimated at $ 25 , 000 . To begin the process of large-scale antibody validation and to provide a large enough dataset to allow for more accurate estimates of the work and financing required to complete such a project , we began with the human proteome . For each protein target , we tested commercial antibodies , provided from various manufacturers , in parallel using standardized protocols , agreed upon by all parties , in WB , IP , and IF applications . We used these protocols to test antibodies against a variety of neuroscience targets , chosen by funders , to predict requirements for the larger goal of coverage of an entire mammalian proteome . Academic and industry scientists aspire to have at least one , and ideally more , potent , selective and renewable antibody for each human
[RESULTS] The highest priority was given to recombinant antibodies as they represent the ultimate renewable reagent and have advantages in terms of adaptability , such as switching IgG subclass or using molecular engineering to achieve higher affinity binding than B-cell generated antibodies . Among the cell lines showing expression above this level , we prioritized a group of 8 common cell line backgrounds representing different cell/tissue types because their doubling time is short , and they are amenable to CRISPR-Cas9 technology ( Figure 1B ) . For IF , we tested 529 antibodies against the set of intracellular proteins ; 22 % of polyclonal antibodies , 31 % of monoclonal antibodies , and 48
[DISCUSSION] Our set of 65 funder-designated proteins is an unbiased sample , representative of the heterogeneity of knowledge of the human proteome ; a search of the NIH protein database revealed that 15 proteins ( 23 % of our protein sample ) are well studied with more than 500 publications and 50 proteins ( 77 % of our protein sample ) have corresponding publications ranging from 37 to 498 ( Figure 1-source data 1 ) . Although we observed that there are more commercial antibodies available for the best-studied proteins ( Figure 1-source data 1 ) , an encouraging result of our work is that more than half of our protein targets are covered by well-performing , renewable antibodies for WB , IP and IF - including both well characterized and more poorly studied proteins . Given that it is difficult to imagine a characterization pipeline dependent
[METHODS] We asked participating antibody suppliers to indicate the number of antibodies eliminated from the market , and the number of antibodies for which there was a change in recommendation due to their evaluation of our characterization data ( Figure 4-figure supplement 2 ) . Performance of each antibody was retrieved from the corresponding ZENODO report or",,996,98,None,"Antibodies are used to detect and characterize proteins , but they are not always the best for each target .

The problem is that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets , and as such , it is difficult for antibody users to select the best antibody for each protein . To address this problem , Wei et al . developed a standardized method to assess the performance of 614 commercially available antibodies for 65 brain-related proteins . These antibodies were tested using a variety of different cell types , including wild type cells , to determine the best antibodies for each specific target , as well as using recombinant antibodies , a type of antibody that can be used in many different applications . In addition , we found that more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more applications , suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant . This suggests that a more efficient strategy is needed to achieve this goal ."

[ABSTRACT] Together , these LexA and QF system vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal . Focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns , we generated a set of more than 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in and verified their tissue specificity in larvae . Finally , using new compatible shRNA vectors , we evaluated both LexA and QF systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a library of such RNAi fly lines as a community resource . Following successful integration of this construct into the fly genome , FLP/FRT recombination is used to isolate fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD . The ability to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal is emerging as a major need , especially in the context of inter-organ communication studies . This type of study is made possible by technologies combining the GAL4/UAS and a second binary expression system such as the LexA system or QF system . Here , we describe a resource of reagents that facilitate combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary system in various Drosophila tissues . We also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector .
[INTRODUCTION] For example , dual expression systems have been used to study how a Drosophila insulin-like peptide released from the wing primordium communicates with the brain to control organ growth , analyze signaling from olfactory neurons to blood cells , independently manipulate ligand-producing and ligand receiving cells , and visualize interactions between clonal cell populations in tissues . The numbers of available LexA and QF fly lines with tissue-specific expression domains are far lower than that represented by the thousands of GAL4 enhancer lines , which have been developed using various approaches over the past 25 years . Together , these QF2/LexA-GAD and QUAS/LexAop vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal . However , these methods require either de novo generation of new driver lines , as for the integrase swappable in vivo targeting element ( InSITE ) system , or PhiC31-induced insertion of a transcription factor cassette into an existing minos-mediated integration cassette genomic insertion . Furthermore , we evaluated both QF2 and LexA-GAD systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a compatible library of transgenic shRNA lines in our custom QUAS and LexAop vectors as a community resource . Focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns , we targeted 23 genes to produce 44 new highly tissue-specific LexA-GAD and QF2 driver lines by CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair . Here , we describe the efforts of the Transgenic RNAi Project ( TRiP ) to facilitate combinatorial studies by building reagents that can be used alongside GAL4/UAS in a variety of tissues . The conversion can be performed through genetic crosses ; however , the frequency of conversion can vary greatly among different GAL4 lines , and many such swaps do not fully reproduce the original GAL4 expression patterns . We chose to use LexA with the GAL4 activation domain , rather than the p65 or VP16 activation domains to allow for temporal control by the temperature-sensitive GAL4 repressor , GAL80 . On average , each StanEx line expresses LexA activity in five distinct cell types , with only one line showing expression in just one tissue , unfortunately limiting usefulness of these reagents . As
[RESULTS] For this combined expression of LexA-GAD and QF2 transcription factors , we built two types of vectors : ( 1 ) a CRISPR donor version , pHDR-T2A-QF2-T2A-LexA-GAD-3xP3-RFP , which is used to insert the cassette into an endogenous locus of interest ( Figure 4A ) , and ( 2 ) a phiC31-attB version , pMCS-T2A-QF2-T2A-LexA-GAD-WALIUM20 , which is used to clone an enhancer fragment of interest and is then integrated into an attP site in the fly 's genome ( Figure 4B ) . In the 'drop-in ' cloning method , a company synthesizes and clones a plasmid that contains all of the necessary features for CRISPR HDR plus a cloning site to allow ligation of T2A-LexA-GAD ,
[DISCUSSION] There have been previous efforts to make LexA and QF tools , but the availability of LexA-GAD and QF2 tissue-specific fly stocks remains a major resource gap , preventing the average fly researcher from performing the type of multi-tissue manipulations that are essential to advance the study of organ and tissue communication . Our collection of T2A-LexA-GAD and T2A-QF2 and double driver vectors can be easily adapted to target any gene for CRISPR knock-in , with a high probability that the resulting line will accurately reflect the expression of the endogenous locus . Further , we expect that there will also be differences between the expression pattern of corresponding GAL4 and the LexA-GAD/QF lines , as the latter were made by knock-in , while the former are often enhancer traps . For example , we identified the uncharacterized genes CG9458 and CG17560 , as highly oenocyte-specific based on the Fly Cell Atlas Single-cell transcriptome
[METHODS] For combined expression of LexA-GAD and QF2 transcription factors , we built two different vectors : ( 1 ) a CRISPR donor version , which we used to insert the LexA-GAD-QF2 cassette into an endogenous locus of interest , such that the expression of lexA-GAD and QF2 is driven by endogenous regulatory sequences , and ( 2 )",,970,97,None,"The wing primordium is a large organ in the fruit fly family , and it contains a protein called GAL4 , which is produced by a gene called QF2 . This protein is also known as LexA . However , it is not known how this protein is able to control the expression of other genes in the fly . In order to study how the fly communicates with the brain , researchers need to understand how two different genes are expressed in the same animal . For example , if the fly has a genetically modified version of the gene called LexA and a variant of the same gene called the QF-2 gene , the fly will have to produce a new version of this gene . To do this , scientists need to create a pair of genes that are both expressed in different tissues . One of these genes , called Lexa-GAD , can be inserted into the genome of the fly and then repressed in a different tissue . Then , using a technique called CRISPR , an enzyme called FLP/FRT , is used to repress a specific gene in the wing . Using this technique , we can create new fly lines that can be used to study the interaction between the two genes . These fly lines can also be used as a resource for researchers who need to use two different proteins to study different organs . Now , Wang et al . have developed a tool called QUAS and LexAop , that allows researchers to create fly lines with two different transcription factors . Each fly line can be made from a single gene and can be replicated in the laboratory . Wang "

[ABSTRACT] We show in mice that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro . Interruption of C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or by deletion of Nrxn3 in the dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b as well as C1ql2 mutant phenotype . Together , this study identifies a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function . Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses . Furthermore , we demonstrate C1ql2 to exert its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3 , Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) . The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction . Thus , our findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction . The underlying molecular mechanisms , however , remained unclear .
[INTRODUCTION] Several of the synaptic proteins have been shown to promote formation of functional pre- and postsynaptic assemblies when presented in non-neuronal cells , showing that their ability to specify synapses is in part independent of signaling processes and neuronal activity and supporting the idea that synaptic function is governed by cues linked to cellular origin . MFS have a critical role in learning and memory stemming from their unique structural and functional properties , such as an enormous pool of releasable synaptic vesicles ( SV ) , and reliable presynaptic short- and long-term plasticity . The sensitivity of the functional specification of the synapse to the combination of distinct synaptic proteins and their relative expression levels suggests that genetically encoded programs define at least facets of the synaptic properties in a cell-type-specific manner . Furthermore , we show that C1ql2 requires direct interaction with a specific neurexin-3 isoform , Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) , a member of a polymorphic family of presynaptic cell adhesion molecules , to recruit SV in vitro and in vivo . These mechanisms involve cell adhesion molecules at both the pre- and post-synaptic side that act as synaptic organizers , whose unique combination determines the structural and functional properties of the synapse . Bcl11b ( also known as Ctip2 ) is a zinc finger transcription factor that has been implicated in various disorders of the nervous system including Alzheimer 's and Huntington 's disease , and schizophrenia . Furthermore , recent advances in the genetics of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders have implicated genes encoding for several of the known synaptic proteins , supporting a role for these molecules in the pathogenesis of corresponding disorders . Reintroduction of C1ql2 in Bcl11b mutant DGN rescued the localization and docking of SV to the active zone ( AZ ) , as well as MF-LTP that was abolished upon Bcl11b ablation . Disruptions in synaptic structure and function have been identified as a major determinant in the manifestation of various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders , such as autism spectrum disorder , schizophrenia , and intellectual disability . Many such proteins have already been identified and our understanding of their complex role in synapse assembly and function has significantly increased over the last years . In the present study , we show that the secreted synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 , a member of the C1q-like
[RESULTS] To further explore whether binding to Nrxn3 is required for C1ql2-dependent regulation of SV recruitment , we stereotaxically injected an AAV expressing GFP-tagged Cre or inactive Cre into the DG of 2-month-old Nrxn1 , 2 & 3flox/flox mice ( Figure 7a ) , which resulted in strong reduction of Nrxn3 mRNA levels in DGN 2 months later . To specifically analyze whether endogenous Nrxn3 is required for C1ql2-mediated vGlut1 accumulation in neurons , we co-cultured C1ql2-secreting HEK293 cells with primary hippocampal neurons derived from Nrxn1 , 2 & 3flox/flox mice , in which all three Nrxn genes are floxed , and which we transfected with either active Cre recombinase or an inactive Cre . To explore the relevant epitope that mediates the binding
[DISCUSSION] While a modest displacement of SV might fail to noticeably influence synaptic transmission due to the low initial Pr at MFS , causing only a fraction of release-ready vesicles to be initially released , the reduction in synapse numbers might indeed be expected to reflect in the input-output relationship . We have previously shown that conditional ablation of Bcl11b in the adult hippocampus leads to structural and functional changes of MFS characterized by an overall reduction in synapse numbers , loss of bouton complexity , misdistribution of SV as well as loss of MF-LTP . Moreover , the existence of such cell-type-specific signaling modules reveals how a fundamental transcription factor with diverse functions such as Bcl11b can be implicated in the pathogenesis of brain disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction . Using shRNA-mediated selective KD of C1ql2 in DGN as well as rescue of the Bcl11b mutation by the reintroduction of C1ql2 into mutant DGN , we observed a novel
[METHODS] LTP was induced by three trains of 100 stimulation pulses at 100 Hz ( high-frequency stimulation , HFS ) , repeated every 8 s. 3 μM DCG-IV ( Tocris Bioscience ) was applied after each experiment , and only recordings displaying > 70 % reduction in putative MF-fEPSP slopes were used for analysis . Input-output relationships were obtained by measuring the",,950,96,None,"Neurons in the nervous system are made up of a series of structures called synapses .

The gene that encodes the protein is known as Ctip2 , which is found in many neurons in the brain . It has been shown that Bcll11b is involved in a number of different types of disorders .

[ABSTRACT] We further studied the first mode of Sfp1 activity and found that , following promoter binding , Sfp1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration , manifested by dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking . We show that Sfp1 can regulate transcription either by binding to promoters , like most known transcription activators , or by binding to the transcribed regions ( gene bodies ) , probably via RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) . Thus , Sfp1 's co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate , serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs , and a paradigm for the dual-role of some zinc-finger proteins . The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1 's relocation to the nascent transcripts , whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability . To function effectively as an integrated system , the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries must communicate through mechanisms that are still poorly understood . The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1 's dissociation from chromatin . Here , we focus on the zinc-finger Sfp1 , known to regulate transcription of proliferation-related genes . We propose that , following promoter recruitment , Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking . Intriguingly , Sfp1 dissociation from the chromatin correlates with the extent of the backtracked Pol II . The interplay between Sfp1 's two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined . Surprisingly , Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them .
[INTRODUCTION] Our previous work has also shown that several RP regulators , including Rap1 and Sfp1 , make transcription of RP genes highly dependent on TFIIS , especially under conditions of transcriptional stress due to NTP depletion . The split-finger protein 1 ( Sfp1 ) is a zinc-finger TF , the deletion or overexpression of which has been shown to affect the recruitment of the TATA-binding protein ( TBP ) and Pol II to RiBi and RiBi-like genes , and to affect the transcription of RP and snoRNA genes . Shore 's lab has examined the Sfp1 configuration within promoters , using either chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP-seq ) or chromatin endogenous cleavage ( ChEC-seq ) , and found that the two approaches exhibit different sensitivity to different configurations . In some proteins , such as TFIIIA , the same zinc-finger domain can recognize both a specific double-stranded DNA sequence and another specific sequence in single-stranded RNA - discussed in Font and MacKay , 2010 . The Sfp1-mediated cross-talk between mRNA synthesis and decay results in the cooperation of these opposing processes to increase mRNA abundance , by stimulating the former and repressing the latter . Imprinting by a 'classical ' transcription factor ( TF ) that binds to specific promoters , thus regulating transcription by modulating the assembly of general transcription factors , including Pol II , is currently unknown . We previously reported a special case of cross-talk between promoter elements and mRNA decay which is mediated by Rap1 binding sites ( RapBSs ) and by Rap1 protein . While Sfp1 binding sites detected by ChEC are enriched for the motif gAAAATTTTc , binding identified by ChIP is dependent on Ifh1 , hence on Rap1 as well . Regulators that antagonize Pol II backtracking are Xrn1 , Rpb4 and the-Ccr4-Not complex , which prevents backtracking in a manner that depends on its Rpb4 and Rpb7 subunits . Important for this paper , Pol II backtracking is highly frequent at RP and RiBi genes , compared to other gene regulons , and is highly dependent on Rap1 . Such imprinting might broaden our understanding of the functions of TFs - not just transcription regulators but regulators of
[RESULTS] These foci represent P-bodies - phase-separated droplets containing RNAs , mRNA decay factors , and other proteins - as they contain the P-body markers Dcp2 and Lsm1 , as well as Rpb4 ( Figure 1B ) , and decrease in number if cells are pre-treated with cycloheximide before starvation . Consistent with Sfp1-binding as a prerequisite feature for its capacity to stabilize mRNAs , the calculated HLs of RP mRNAs and the 25 RiBi CRAC+ , but not RiBi non-CRAC + mRNAs and 'Rest ' ( the bulk of the mRNAs ) , decreased more than those of the other genes due to SFP1 deletion ( Figure 4A , 'HL ' panel ) .
[DISCUSSION] Based on the following observations , we propose that Sfp1 binds to Pol II in proximity to both DNA and Rpb4 , accompanying Pol II during elongation and influencing its configuration , thereby enhancing its propensity to backtrack ( Figure 8A ) : ( I ) Sfp1 physically interacts with Rpb4 , either directly or indirectly ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1 ) . These results , in combination with the weak interaction of Sfp1 with chromatin ( Figure 5A 'Sfp1 Control ' ) , are in accord with previous observation that expression of > 30 % of the genes , most are not considered to be direct targets of Sfp1 , is affected by either Sfp1 depletion or its overexpression . Given that proteins with zinc fingers , characteristic of many TFs , are known to be involved in DNA , RNA , and protein binding , it

[ABSTRACT] Here , we investigate the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots , focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO ( SMB ) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1 . Additionally , reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells , suggesting a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots . This demonstrates that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root . Mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica , primarily in the differentiation zone . smb-3 mutants additionally exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of S. indica-induced root-growth promotion . Programmed cell death occurring during plant development ( dPCD ) is a fundamental process integral for plant growth and reproduction .
[INTRODUCTION] In contrast , LRC cells at the distal end of the root tip elongate and reach the edge of the meristematic zone where they undergo dPCD followed by corpse clearance on the root surface , orchestrated as part of a terminal differentiation program by the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC33/SOMBRERO . BFN1 localizes in the ER , but upon cell death the protein is released and its nuclease activity ensures rapid and irreversible degradation of RNA and DNA in the nucleus and cytoplasm as part of a rapid cell-autonomous corpse clearance at the root surface . As a root endophyte , S. indica colonizes the epidermal and cortex layers of a broad range of different plant hosts , conferring various beneficial effects , including plant growth promotion , protection against pathogenic microbes and increased tolerance to abiotic stresses . The switch between the biotrophic and the cell death-associated phase can vary depending on the host system and environmental conditions , but has been postulated to occur approximately 6-8 days post inoculation ( dpi ) in Arabidopsis . The colonization strategy of S. indica comprises an initial biotrophic interaction , followed by a growth phase associated with a restricted host cell death that does not , however , diminish the beneficial effects on the plant host . Here , we show that the accumulation of uncleared LRC cell corpses on the roots of smb-3 mutants triggers hypercolonization by S. indica , especially around the meristematic zone , and delays S. indica-induced root growth promotion . Interestingly , the aberrant cell death of LRC cells in the elongation zone of smb-3 mutants is not followed by corpse clearance , resulting in an accumulation of uncleared cell corpses along the entire root surface . To address this question , we tested two well-characterized loss-of-function T-DNA insertion lines , smb-3 and bfn1-1 , during colonization with Serendipita indica , a beneficial fungus of the order Sebacinales . Loss of SMB activity results in a delayed cell death , causing LRC cells to enter the elongation zone where they eventually die without expression of dPCD executor genes in the root cap . Although several effector proteins involved in fungal accommodation have been described , the exact mechanism by which S. indica manipulates host cell death and the role of dPCD in fungal accommodation in the roots are largely unclear . We propose that a tight regulation of host dPCD
[RESULTS] While SMB expression is restricted to the LRC , BFN1 exhibits a broader expression pattern across various cell types and tissues , such as root cap cells , cells adjacent to emerging lateral root primordia , differentiating xylem tracheary elements , as well as senescent leaves , and abscission zones of flowers and seeds . When comparing staining intensities of S. indica-inoculated bfn1-1 mutants and WT seedlings , we observed a significantly stronger fluorescence signal at the roots of bfn1-1 mutants , indicating a higher extraradical fungal colonization along the differentiation zone ( Figure 5E and F and Figure 5-figure supplement 1 ) . In agreement with the previously described GUS reporter lines , we detected activation of the BFN1 promoter via accumulation of the fluorescent
[DISCUSSION] The importance of an intact root cap in plant-microbe interactions is further highlighted by the fact that the physical removal of root caps in maize plants leads to increased colonization of the root tip by the plant growth promoting rhizobacterium ( PGPR ) Pseudomonas fluorescens and to changes in the rhizosphere microbiome composition along the root axis . It was recently demonstrated that small active metabolites produced either by Toll/interleukin-1 receptor ( TIR ) -containing leucine-rich repeat ( NLR ) receptors or by fungal-derived enzymes through hydrolysis of RNA/DNA can mediate host cell death . This raises an exciting possibility that RNAse and DNAse activities of BFN1 may be involved in producing small , active nucleotide-derived metabolites that affect cell death , cell corpse clearance , proteostasis and fungal accommodation in the differentiation zone . This suggests an age-dependent dPCD in the outer epidermal layer of Arabidopsis roots where expression of BFN1 possibly pre-dates cortical and epidermal abscission during secondary root growth and
[METHODS] In case of experiments using seeds inoculation with S. indica , Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized , incubated with fungal spore solution at 5x105 concentration for 1 hr and plated on ½ MS plates ( without sucrose ) . The quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) was performed using a CFX connect real time system ( BioRad ) with the following program",,943,96,None,"When a plant develops , its cells undergo a process known as ‘programmed cell death’ . This process is called dPCD , and it is important to understand how this process works in plants . In plants , a fungus called Serendipita indica colonizes the epidermal and cortex layers of the plant . The process is controlled by a protein called ANAC033/SOMBRERO , which regulates the activity of the transcription factor BFN1 . However , the exact mechanism by which S . indica manipulates this process is not clear . To investigate this , Wang et al . used a technique called T-DNA insertion to study the role of two genes in the process of d PCD in Arabidopsis thaliana roots . These genes are involved in the formation of the meristematic zone of the root cap . During this stage , cells in this zone die , leaving behind a large number of dead cells . When the senescence-associated nuclease BFN-1 is activated , it releases the protein into the nucleus and cytoplasm , where it can be used to destroy the RNA and DNA that is stored in the cytosol . Wang also found that a small protein called BFN 1 is also involved in this process . Mutations in the gene that controls the synthesis of the protein cause the cells to become more crowded and to die . Further experiments showed that , when the mutants were exposed to a variety of environmental conditions , they were able to colonize the root surface . Furthermore , these mutants also had a delay in removing the corpses from the root . Therefore , this suggests that the fung"

[ABSTRACT] In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs , ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes , dead eggs , or even fluid , supporting that distention consequences , rather than the presence of fertilized eggs , constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus . Conversely , restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production . Genetic disruption of C. elegans germline , sperm , oocytes , or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period . Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms , making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease . Large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to spreading pathogenic protein aggregates and promoting inflammatory responses , two mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative disease . Factors that regulate the extrusion of large vesicles , such as exophers produced by proteostressed C. elegans touch neurons , are poorly understood . We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons . Overall , genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths and genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths . Exopher production from the C. elegans ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3 , coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak . Here , we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons .
[INTRODUCTION] We document that uterine expansion , rather than chemical signals emanating from fertilized eggs , correlates strongly with the level of exopher production and suggest a model in which mechanical signaling , normally induced across generations from egg to parent via uterine stretch , is a license for proteostressed neurons to release potentially toxic materials in large extracellular vesicles . Disrupting proteostasis via diminished chaperone expression , autophagy , or proteasome activity , or over-expressing aggregating proteins like human Alzheimer 's disease associated fragment Aβ1-42 , expanded polyglutamine Q128 protein , or high concentration mCherry fluorophore , increases exopher production from the affected neurons . We model aggregate transfer by proteostressed ALMR touch receptor neurons in the living C. elegans nervous system , an experimental system that enables molecular and genetic manipulation and evaluation in a physiological context , directly through the transparent cuticle . Study of aggregate transfer in the context of the mammalian brain is a major experimental challenge as events are rare , sporadic , and transiently apparent , and tissue is not easily accessible for in vivo observation . More specifically , C. elegans adult neurons can extrude large vesicles called exophers ( ~5 µm ; 100 X larger than exosomes ) that carry potentially deleterious proteins and organelles out of the neuron . While using chemical regent 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine ( FUdR ) to block progeny production for aging studies , we found that blocking reproduction strongly limited the early adult peak of exopher production . Our observations direct enhanced experimental attention to studies on how mechanical force can influence extracellular vesicle formation and aggregate transfer in the living brain and in neurodegenerative disease . Neurons that express proteotoxic transgenes maintain higher functionality if those neurons produce exophers as compared to those that do not , suggesting that exopher-genesis can be neuroprotective , at least in young adult neurons . Mechanical signaling exerts a profound impact on virtually all cell types , and has been implicated in traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disease , yet remains poorly understood . Several mammalian models feature similar biology , and thus we speculate that the basic transfer biology represents a conserved process that can be recruited
[RESULTS] We tested four genetic conditions that lower or block egg-laying : a null mutation of prolyl hydroxylase egl-9 , for which disruption induces a mild egg-laying defect ; a null allele of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 2 egl-3 that perturbs neuropeptide processing and confers a severe egg-laying defective phenotype ; a reduction-of-function mutation in SOX transcription factor SEM-2 ( sem-2 ) that eliminates production of the sex myoblasts needed to generate egg laying muscle ; and RNAi directed against the lin-39 homeobox transcription factor HOXA5 ortholog required for vulval cell fate specification . We conclude that adult ALMR exophergenesis is driven by the presence of fertilized eggs and that the older age decrease in
[DISCUSSION] More broadly , proteome 'clean up ' phases may be programmed as key steps at specific transitions during development and homeostasis , for example , as occurs in the temporal lysosome activation that clears aggregate debris in C. elegans maturing oocytes or in the maturation of mouse adult neuronal stem cells via vimentin-dependent proteasome activity during quiescence exit . We speculate that young adult physiology might be temporally tweaked such that some tissues have optimized capacity to manage/degrade large aggregates and organelles at an early adult developmental 'clean up ' time , possibly analogous to how a town service for bulky oversized garbage pick-up might be limited to particular days during the year . At the same time , the neurodegeneration field has generated myriad studies linking Alzheimer 's disease susceptibility and AD pathology signatures such as extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β protein and/or intracellular accumulation of tau as
[METHODS] We left the plate on an open bench at room temperature for one or two days to dry out the auxin solution , then seeded the plate with 200 ul OP50-1 E. coli and waited for another two or three days before storing the plates in a 4 °C environmental room . We then placed coverslips",,985,98,None,"The brain is made up of many different types of cells , including neurons . Each type of cell contains a specific type of protein , called an exosome , which can carry potentially toxic materials out of the cell . Exosomes are made of small molecules called proteins , and they can be used to make new proteins . When a cell divides , it releases a protein called a vesicle into the cell’s environment . This protein is called an “exopher” . It is made from a small protein called proteostressed cells . The exopher is made by a nerve cell called the C . elegans touch receptor ( ALMR ) . In humans , the exophers are made from cells that have been exposed to chemical signals . However , in animals , these signals can be triggered by mechanical forces . For example , if the uterine is stretched , an egg will be produced , while a fertilized egg will produce oocytes and dead eggs . If the ovary is stretched too much , then an egg can be produced and the sperm will be removed . These changes can lead to a decrease in the amount of protein that is released from the cell and cause the cell to become more prone to disease . Now , Wang et al . have investigated how mechanical forces can influence the production of exopherins from the C-eleggans uterus . They used a technique called mechanical force to stretch the cell's cuticle . To do this , they inserted a chemical called FUdR into the ovaries of the fetus and injected the chemicals into the brain . After the chemicals were removed from the brain cells"

[ABSTRACT] Our findings show that DKK3 expression is upregulated in the brains of AD subjects and that DKK3 protein levels increase at early stages in the disease . In hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse AD models , extracellular DKK3 levels are increased and DKK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques . Functionally , DKK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway . Studies reveal that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 ( DKK3 ) colocalizes to amyloid plaques in AD patients . Collectively , our findings identify DKK3 as a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD . Here , we investigate the contribution of DKK3 to synapse integrity in healthy and AD brains . In contrast , DKK3 knockdown restores synapse number and memory in hAPP-J20 mice . Increasing evidence supports a role for deficient Wnt signaling in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .
[INTRODUCTION] The disease is characterized by progressive synaptic dysfunction and loss , early signatures that correlate with cognitive decline in AD and precede both neuronal death and the onset of severe dementia by at least 10 years . Functionally , our confocal and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that increased levels of DKK3 trigger the loss of excitatory synapses with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses in the adult mouse hippocampus through different Wnt pathways . Although the primary neuropathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , soluble Aβ oligomers ( Aβo ) are considered one of the key toxic proteins driving synapse dysfunction . Supporting the role of deficient Wnt signaling in AD , three genetic variants of LRP6 , a crucial Wnt co-receptor , are linked to late-onset AD and confer decreased Wnt signaling in cell lines . However , the impact of DKK3 on synapses and cognitive function , which are affected by deficient Wnt signalling , in AD remains to be studied . Like other DKKs , DKK3 has two cysteine-rich domains but it also contains an elongated N-terminus with a Soggy domain . Crucially , in vivo downregulation of DKK3 ameliorates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic defects in the hippocampus and improves memory in an AD mouse model . Recent findings indicate that DKK3 is increased in plasma , and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , and accumulates in Aβ plaques in the human AD brain . Together , our findings in humans and functional studies in mice identify DKK3 as a driver of synapse pathology and cognitive impairment in AD . In addition , Frizzled-1 ( Fz1 ) and Fz7 , Wnt receptors present at synapses , are downregulated in the hippocampus of AD subjects and AD models . However , the exact mechanisms by which Aβo impair synapse function and cause their degeneration are not fully understood . For example , levels of the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 ( DKK1 ) are increased in the brain of AD patients and AD models . Current AD models suggest that amyloid-β ( Aβ ) initiates a pathophysiological cascade leading to synapse failure and eventually cognitive decline . Dkk3 knock-out mice are viable and do not exhibit morphological alterations in the brain , but female mice manifest hyperlocomotion . However , the molecular mechanisms by which deficient Wnt signaling contributes to synaptic defects in AD are poorly understood
[RESULTS] Given that DKK1 , a member of the Dkk family , leads to excitatory synapse disassembly and synaptic plasticity defects , we evaluated the impact of increased DKK3 levels on synapses by performing ex vivo gain-of-function experiments using brain slices ( Figure 3A ) . The lack of a difference in DKK3 levels in the total homogenate could be explained by the fact that only a small fraction of cellular DKK3 is released into the extracellular media , as supported by our findings that DKK3 was less abundant in the extracellular fraction when compared to the total homogenate ( Figure 2-figure supplement 3D ) . In the hippocampus , DKK3 protein was highly abundant in neurons of the CA1 , CA2 , and CA3 pyramidal
[DISCUSSION] These apparently paradoxical results could be reconciled by our finding that only a small proportion of DKK3 is released from neurons , and therefore changes in DKK3 protein levels are not detected in the total cell lysate . We found that extracellular DKK3 levels are elevated in brain slices from J20 and NLGF models before substantial amyloid burden occurs , whereas acute exposure to Aβo increase both total and extracellular DKK3 levels in neurons . Although loss of synapses around amyloid plaques is well described , changes in synapse number induced by silencing DKK3 is unlikely to be due to the formation of plaques as we observed similar synaptic changes when plaques are absent . Our functional studies in the J20 mouse model of AD demonstrate that knocking down DKK3 in J20 mice ameliorates the changes in excitatory and inhibitory synapse number in the hippocampus both before and after plaque deposition . Consistent with these findings , we demonstrate that DKK3 accumulates
[METHODS] The solution was then sonicated at 40 Hz for 10 min followed by vortexing for 30 s. Sterile PBS was added to achieve a final Aβ1-42 or Aβ42-1 concentration of 100 μM , and vortexed again for 20 s. The peptides were left to oligomerize for 24 hr at 4 °C . Five to 30 ng of the original RNA was used",,942,95,None,"The brain is made up of neurons , called synapses , that communicate with each other . These connections are known as synapses , and they can be damaged or damaged by chemicals called amyloid- ( A ) . A is found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease , which is caused by a protein called Dickkopf-3 . This protein is known to be involved in the formation of plaques that form around the brain . However , it is not clear how this protein causes the plaques to form . Now , Wang et al . have investigated the role of the secreted Wnt signaling protein Dickkopf-1 in the development of AD . The experiments show that the levels of DKK3 are increased in healthy and AD brains . Previous studies have shown that DKK1 is also increased in blood and cerebrospinal fluid , but this is not the case in AD patients . Wang and Wang have now used mice that have been treated with a drug called hAPP-J20 to study the effects of Dkk3 on the brain of AD patients and AD models . In the experiments , the mice were given a dose of the drug and then injected with the drug to see how it affects the brain activity of the mice . They were then able to remember their memories and recall their memories in the future . When the mice had been treated for AD , they had a better memory . Moreover , when the mice did not have the drug , their memory was restored . Further experiments showed that the level of the DKK2 protein was increased in both healthy andAD brains and that this increased levels of the protein were associated with the loss of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections in the hippocampus "

[ABSTRACT] Here , we show that the iron-chelating pyoverdines , siderophores produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp. , have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens . A screen of 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates used against 12 human pathogens uncovered several pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics . The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of the pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner . Thus , pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens . Pyoverdine increased survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host , mammalian cell lines , and erythrocytes . Furthermore , experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic . A common approach is to search for natural compounds deployed by microbes to inhibit competitors . The global rise of antibiotic resistance calls for new drugs against bacterial pathogens .
[INTRODUCTION] Subsequently , we assessed the efficacy of the three top pyoverdine candidates against four human opportunistic pathogens ( Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Staphylococcus aureus ) in vitro and/or in vivo via infections of the Greater wax moth larvae ( Galleria mellonella ) . Numerous alternative approaches have been proposed , including phage therapy , antimicrobial peptides and nanobodies , antivirulence treatments to disarm pathogens , treatments that capitalize on ecological competition between susceptible and resistant bacteria , and the search for new antibacterial compounds produced by environmental microbes . Mining natural microbial communities has become a promising endeavor in the hunt for novel antimicrobials because most microbes deploy bioactive compounds to contend with their competitors in the diverse assemblies they live in . Because siderophores are often species specific , they have two opposing effects : they make iron available for related community members possessing the matching receptor but withhold iron from competitors with non-matching receptors . To test our hypothesis , we screened pyoverdines from a library of 320 environmental Pseudomonas strains , isolated from soil and freshwater habitats , for their activity against 12 strains of human opportunistic bacteria . Pyoverdines show an extraordinary structural diversity with more than 70 described variants that differ in their peptide backbone and have an extremely high affinity for iron . Upon complexation with ferric iron , the iron-loaded pyoverdine is imported into the cell by receptors with high specificity and subsequently reduced to the bio-available ferrous iron . Finally , we used experimental evolution combined with whole-genome sequencing to study the potential of pathogens evolving resistance against pyoverdine treatment . Thus , the development of alternative therapies with higher sustainability to counteract the rapidly dwindling treatment options due to resistance evolution is imperative . Specifically , we investigate whether siderophores from non-pathogenic environmental bacteria can induce iron starvation and growth arrest in human pathogens . We focus on pyoverdines , a class of siderophores with high iron affinity that are produced and secreted by fluorescent Pseudomonas spp . For example , there is increasing evidence that competition for iron is a main determinant of species interactions in soil and freshwater communities . The isolation , characterization , and synthesis of such secondary metabolites can result in novel prospective antibiotics for clinical applications . For the most promising pyoverdine candidates , we elucidated the
[RESULTS] The same trend was observed for our second measure of stability ( CE50 , normalized collision energy ( NCE ) necessary to fragment 50 % of ferri-pyoverdines ) , but in this case , the difference between the two pyoverdine classes was not significant ( F1 , 11 = 1 . Taken together , we found that the observed weak resistance evolution against pyoverdine in P. aeruginosa and S. aureus was not linked to mechanisms directly enhancing the pathogen 's iron acquisition but with mutations in global regulators , metabolism , biofilm , and motility genes . We assessed the ability of A. baumannii , K. pneumoniae , P. aeruginosa , and S. aureus to evolve resistance against the pyoverdine treatment by exposing all
[DISCUSSION] Especially the finding that pyoverdines have no negative effects on the survival of non-replicating NSC-34 cells is encouraging , as this cell line is representative of intact host tissue , in which iron is bound to strong chelators such as transferrin , lactoferrin , or ferritin . Combined with low toxicity to hosts at therapeutically effective concentrations and minimal potential for resistance evolution , these natural chelators hold promise as a new class of effective antibacterials , either as standalone treatments or in combination with conventional antibiotics . While we do not know the phenotypes of these mutations , one possibility is that increased biofilm formation could offer some protection against pyoverdine treatment , for example , by restricting pyoverdine from chelating free iron . Taken together , we predict that pyoverdine treatment could be highly potent against certain pathogens like A. baumannii and S. aureus that have less efficient siderophores and are unable to use the pyoverdine as iron source
[METHODS] To determine the cytotoxicity of pyoverdine treatments against mammalian cells , we subjected human embryonic kidney 293 and mouse motor neuron-like neuroblastoma-spinal cord hybrid ( NSC-34 ; Cedarlane CLU140 , authenticated ) cells to the crude extract of the three most potent pyoverdines ( 3A06 , 3G07 , s3b09 ) . We also measured the CCS values of pyoverdines and ferri-pyoverdines",,951,96,None,"The world’s largest bacterial community is made up of thousands of bacteria , including bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics . Many of these bacteria have been found in the soil or freshwater ecosystems , and some of them have been used as antibiotics for decades . However , antibiotic resistance has become a major problem in recent years , with the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria rising . In particular , it is becoming increasingly difficult to treat infections caused by bacteria that live in the environment . One way to combat this problem is to use antibiotics that are produced by bacteria . For example , some antibiotics can be used to treat bacterial infections , while others can be applied to other infections . To find out which antibiotics are safe and effective against these bacteria and how they work , Wang et al . used 320 natural Pseudomonas strains isolated from soil and freshwater habitats to study the effects of these antibiotics on human pathogens and their growth . The experiments showed that the most potent pyoverdine was able to reduce the growth of the four human pathogenic bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus . This was achieved by using a chemical called iron chelating peptide , which is produced by the bacteria and released into the cells of the host . It also reduced the growth rate of the pathogen , causing the parasites to grow faster . Wang also found that the pYoverdines produced by environmental bacteria were more potent than the antibiotics used against the four pathogenic species . Therefore , the discovery of new antibacterial compounds from environmental bacteria could help to counteract the rapidly dwindling treatment options ."

[ABSTRACT] To address that question , we developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits that can explain the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits we recently observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia . This is a crucial gap in our understanding because it prevents us from discovering how genetic mutations and environmental risks that alter synaptic function cause prefrontal network to fail in schizophrenia . These findings strongly parallel dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony we observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior , as well as the suppression of this 0-lag spiking by administration of NMDAR antagonists . As such , our cortical network model provides a plausible mechanism explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia . We show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs such as might occur during behavior . We analyze how the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influence oscillatory spike synchrony to inform the biological data . Schizophrenia results in part from a failure of prefrontal networks but we lack full understanding of how disruptions at a synaptic level cause failures at the network level .
[INTRODUCTION] The current results allow us to establish strong parallels between simulated and biological data , including the emergence of 0-lag synchronous spiking via recurrent synaptic interactions between neurons during behavior , the association between synchronous spiking and oscillatory population activity , as well as their joint dependence on NMDAR synaptic mechanisms , both in our current simulation and in the neural data . Second , increased extrinsic inputs , such as those that might occur during behavior , shift these networks from a steady to an oscillatory regime that causes the emergence of 0-lag spiking between neurons as they stochastically entrain to oscillatory population activity . Third , and perhaps most importantly , we show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents these networks from transitioning into oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs , thereby preventing the emergence of 0-lag spike synchrony . To address these questions , we recently investigated how blocking NMDAR altered neural dynamics and effective communication between neurons in prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing a cognitive control task measuring deficits in schizophrenia . In the current study , we developed a spiking neural network model to understand mechanisms that might mediate the link between NMDAR synaptic malfunction and neural dynamics ( reduced 0-lag synchronous spiking ) we observed in biological data . We use network stability and mean field analyses to investigate how the balance between NMDA and AMPA components of recurrent excitatory and GABA inhibitory currents influence regimes of network dynamics and spiking synchrony . We show that simulated prefrontal networks operating near the boundary between steady ( asynchronous irregular ) and oscillatory ( synchronous irregular ) regimes in the synaptic parameter space can explain several key experimental observations . NMDAR synaptic malfunction has been implicated as causal in schizophrenia , and loss of NMDAR synaptic function in prefrontal networks is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits as well as clinical symptoms in the disease . However , we do not have a complete understanding of how NMDAR synaptic mechanisms influence neural dynamics in prefrontal networks , nor how the disruption of NMDAR synaptic mechanisms might cause prefrontal networks to malfunction . Although prior modeling studies have addressed the relationship between NMDAR function and oscillatory activity in prefrontal networks , none account for
[RESULTS] To examine the boundary between the regions of asynchronous and synchronous states , we fix the balance of tonic NMDA current relative to GABA current , INMDA/IGABA , and vary the remaining two parameters : the balance between recurrent excitation and inhibition , IAMPA/IGABA , and the balance between external excitation and firing threshold , IX , E/Iθ , E. For a given point in this ( IAMPA/IGABA , IX , E/Iθ , E ) parameter plane we solve the mean field equations to find the underlying set of eight synaptic conductances that provide the prescribed rates vE0 and vI0 given external spike rate νX , and then carry out linear stability analysis to find out if these
[DISCUSSION] Although these modeling studies provide important mechanistic insight into prefrontal network dynamics underlying working memory , and potentially , working memory deficits in schizophrenia , they do not address the topic of the current study , which is how slow NMDAR recurrent excitation and external input received by the network jointly influence spike timing dynamics at the neuron level and oscillatory dynamics at the population level in the presence of fast AMPA excitation and GABA inhibition . Given these considerations , the convergent spike desynchronization we observed in monkey drug and mouse genetic models could be explained by an inverted U-shaped relationship wherein either too little NMDAR function ( as produced by NMDAR blockade in monkeys ) or too much NMDAR function ( as predicted to result from deletion of Dgcr8 in mice ) decreases the frequency of 0-lag spiking between prefrontal neurons . Key parameters that could influence the diversity of outcomes
[METHODS] To determine if the network develops oscillatory instability caused by small fluctuations in population firing rates , we seek solutions for the rates νE ( t ) and νI ( t ) in which initially small ( with relative amplitudes εE≪1 and εI≪1 ) oscillatory perturbations that can change exponentially with time are added to the stationary rates",,969,97,None,"Neurons in the brain communicate with each other by a network of neurons called synapses . These neurons communicate with one another by sending signals to each other , which are known as spikes . When a neuron receives a signal from another neuron , the spikes become synchronized . This is known as spiking . In schizophrenia , a protein called NMDAR is found in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys , and it is thought to be involved in regulating the activity of the neurons . However , it is not clear how this protein affects the behavior of the monkeys in schizophrenia . To address this question , Wang et al . developed a new model of the brain that can explain how the neurons in the monkey’s brain communicate . The model was based on a monkey model of schizophrenia that used a drug called benzodiazepines to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia in mice . Wang enlisted the help of a team of scientists to develop a model that could explain how neurons in this model communicate with the rest of the neuron in the mouse brain . They then used this model to study how the brain responds to stimuli that might occur during behavior . Using this model , they found that the neurons that communicated with the other neuron were able to communicate more effectively with each others . Furthermore , these neurons were unable to communicate with their counterparts when they received stimuli , such as stimuli from other neurons , that might happen during the behavior they were doing . Therefore , this model could explain why schizophrenia is a disease that affects many people ."

[ABSTRACT] Here , by combining a controlled experimental angiogenesis model with mathematical and computational analyses , we find that the regular spatial Tip-Stalk cell patterning can undergo an order-disorder transition at a relatively high input level of a pro-angiogenic factor VEGF . Together , our data suggest that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation enabling but not instructing subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis , which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms . We further find that sprouts form in a manner maximizing their mutual distance , consistent with a Turing-like model that may depend on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin . The initial steps of angiogenesis depend on robust differentiation of oligopotent endothelial cells into the Tip and Stalk phenotypic cell fates , controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell-cell communication . Angiogenesis is a morphogenic process resulting in the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones , usually in hypoxic micro-environments . The resulting differentiation is robust but temporally unstable for most cells , with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions . This analysis can assist in further understanding of cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and other complex morphogenic processes . The dynamics of spatial patterning of this cell fate specification are only partially understood .
[INTRODUCTION] Furthermore , although our analysis was successful in explaining the fraction of Tip cells formed under different conditions , it was not clear how to account for the spatial aspects of the Tip cell and mature sprout specification , such as their mutual separation and density . Further analysis revealed that the stable sprout formation from mini-sprouts can be enabled by the local fluctuations of the density of fibronectin , a key pro-angiogenic ECM component , leading to sparse patterns where sprouts tend to maximally distance themselves from other fully formed sprouts . Since such measurements are still challenging in vivo , particularly in mammalian tissues , use of tissue models recapitulating the salient features of the developing vasculature is a key tool in the current analysis of angiogenesis and development of de novo vascular beds . We have previously used this approach to map different combinations of VEGF and an inflammatory cytokine , Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , onto pro- and anti-angiogenic outcomes , modeling frequently encountered angiogenesis conditions . Pro-angiogenic factors secreted in response to hypoxic conditions , particularly the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , specify differentiation of endothelial cells lining blood vessels into diverse phenotypic states , including the pro-migratory Tip cell phenotype . However , it was not clear whether all such 'mini-sprouts ' would ultimately develop into more mature multicellular sprouts with defined lumens and the potential to form new blood vessels . Stalk cells can therefore form in immediate proximity of Tip cells , particularly , at the leading edge of an extending sprout , if the NOTCH signaling is sufficiently pronounced for the Tip-Stalk differentiation to occur . Tip cells are differentiated from Stalk cells , another phenotypic state , through juxtacrine cell-cell interaction between these cell types involving NOTCH1 signaling , triggered and modulated by induction of Dll4 and Jag1 ligands . Furthermore , the experimentally determined spatial positioning of mini-sprouts was well explained by the predicted locations of the Tip cells in the mathematical model but the model could not account for which of the mini-sprouts would become fully formed sprouts . The inputs specifying the cell fate can be potentially contradictory , for example , with pro-angiogenic factors , such as VEGF , promoting the Tip cell fate , and the
[RESULTS] This assumption did not impede our effort to compare the overall trends with results from modeling using hexagonal cells , as shown in Figure 3D , E. The integrative , computational , and experimental analysis presented above suggested that the spatial Tip cell distribution can be well explained by the model of a partially disordered 'salt-and-pepper ' mechanism . We therefore set out to characterize these processes in the context of an accessible and well-defined analysis tool that can allow to contrast experimental findings with mathematical models of angiogenic patterning , particularly those based on the commonly assumed NOTCH receptor-mediated cell-cell interactions ( Figure 1G ) . Furthermore , while all models overestimated the fraction of the adjacent sprouts that
[DISCUSSION] Endothelial fate induction process may be interesting to contrast with other complex multicellular processes , including collective epithelial migration , where NOTCH signaling similarly modulates fine-grained patterns of leader and follower cells , and underscore the need in the future to develop more refined models that explicitly integrate the interconnections between biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip-Stalk fate . Although the actual mechanism of putative Turning-like pattern formation is not fully elucidated here , our results are consistent with a variant of this regulatory behavior , in which a component of the ECM , fibronectin is actively redistributed by the nascent sprouts , with this ECM component being enriched at the points of sprout formation , but depleted in other zones , thus preventing sprout induction in the depleted areas . This dynamic fate-switching behavior can thus represent a signature of an unstable differentiation process that may either stabilize , in response to additional cues ,

The first step in angiogenic morphogenesis is to divide the blood vessels into two different types , called Tip cells and Stalk cells . These two types of blood vessels are called ‘stalk cells’ . They are made of a protein called Notch1 , a signaling protein that is secreted by endothelial cells to regulate cell division . However , this signaling is not enough to guide the formation and maintenance of the new blood vessel . To understand how this process works , Wang et al . used a technique called computational modeling to study how the shape of the blood vessel changes as it develops . In the experiments , the researchers found that a number of different types of cells – called ‘mini-sprouts’ – were formed in the same way as the Tip and ‘Stalk’ cells , but they were different in their shape . For example , one type of blood vessel called the Stalk cell was formed in close proximity to another , while the other type was formed near the leading edge of another . Wang also found that the size of the sprouts varies between the two types . It was not clear how this change in shape affects how the sprout forms , or how it affects the size and shape of other blood vessels in the future . Further experiments showed that , in contrast to other types of tissue , some of the cells in the sprout form in a way that maximizes their"

[ABSTRACT] Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine , several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions . We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation . We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity . Here , we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice . However , the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown . In some cases , it appears that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine . Finally , we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation , while norepinephrine is not . Locus coeruleus ( LC ) projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory .
[INTRODUCTION] Because trace fear conditioning ( a ) requires intact hippocampal activity and ( b ) involves learning about discrete , well-controlled stimuli , it is ideally suited to characterize the rapid temporal dynamics of LC activity and LC-HPC communication during learning and examine their role in long term memory formation . We extend this data by providing direct evidence that LC activity increases both dopamine and norepinephrine content in the HPC and by showing that dopamine release is important for trace fear memory formation , but the release of norepinephrine is not . This does not rule out the possibility that phasic LC activity and dopamine signaling is important for spatial learning , but the lack of experimental control over the animals ' sampling of the relevant stimuli makes this possibility opaque to examination . Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine , several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus ( HPC ) and other cortical regions . In others , it is difficult to determine the importance of time-locked phasic firing because of the use of spatial memory tasks that are commonly used to assess hippocampus ( HPC ) -dependent memory . Low tonic activity ( ~0-2 Hz ) is associated with drowsiness or sleep and increasing levels of tonic activity ( ~3-10 Hz ) are associated with increased arousal , progressing from exploration and task engagement to agitation and anxiety states . To address these issues , we used a trace fear conditioning task in which animals learn an association between a neutral and aversive stimulus that are separated in time . However , studies examining the effect of LC on HPC-dependent memory have generally not distinguished between tonic and phasic LC activity or between dopamine and norepinephrine signaling . Studies that have used discrete reward learning tasks to examine dopamine function in the HPC have also not typically distinguished between tonic and phasic release . Here , we used fiber photometry and optogenetics to make temporally precise observations and manipulations of LC activity during learning in a trace fear conditioning task . The locus coeruleus ( LC ) supports an array of cognitive processes by modulating brain-wide arousal states and responding to salient events in the environment
[RESULTS] Additionally , as this association is extinguished and the tone becomes less predictive of an aversive outcome , the LC response is reduced - there was no significant difference between fear conditioned and tone only mice on the second or third days of behavior when neither group was receiving footshocks . During the training session , 20 Hz blue light was delivered to the locus coeruleus in three two-second periods beginning at each of the trial events when consistent LC responses were observed in fiber photometry experiments : tone onset , tone termination , and shock onset ( Figure 4C ) . To observe LC responses to auditory stimuli , we expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s specifically in
[DISCUSSION] Across all intensities , LC responses were larger to the aversive stimuli than to neutral auditory stimuli , suggesting that the LC may encode some information about the emotional valence of stimuli in addition to the simple sensory salience - though to determine this conclusively would require equating the salience of stimuli across the somatosensory and auditory modalities while varying the emotional valence , which may not be possible , especially in a rodent model . However , it was important to test whether LC-HPC projections respond during trace conditioning directly , as more recent work suggests the LC may be composed of many distinct 'modules ' of neurons that project to separate regions and it is not yet known whether these modules exhibit different response properties . Previous work has shown that LC neurons can respond more to conditioned than non-conditioned stimuli ; however , to our knowledge , this is the first demonstration
[METHODS] The fluorescence from neurons below the fiber tip was transmitted via this same cable back to the mini-cube , where it was passed through an emission filter , amplified , and focused onto a femtowatt photoreceiver ( Newport ) . For GRAB-NE and GRAB-DA DREADDs experiments , ΔF/F calculation did not use the isosbestic channel due to differential bleaching",,960,96,None,"A neuron called the locus coeruleus ( LC ) is responsible for regulating the activity of the brain’s hippocampus , which helps to learn about the world around us . The LC is thought to be involved in a number of processes , including learning about the environment , learning about a new object , and learning about how to respond to an unexpected situation . However , it is not clear how the LC acts during this process . To investigate this question , Wang et al . studied mice that had been trained to fear a particular object . They were given a task that involved learning about what happened to them when they were scared . When the mice were given the task , they were shown to be more active than normal . This was because the mice had been exposed to a variety of different stimuli , such as a sound , a smell , or a noise . These animals were also shown to respond differently to the same stimulus , but the timing of these responses was not known . Wang feigns that the mice’s brains were more active when they learned to fear the object compared to when they did not learn to fear it . In addition , when the mice learned to avoid a specific object – such as walking on a sidewalk – they were more likely to remember the object than when they had learned to walk on it , so they were less likely to recall the object when they knew it was a threat . Furthermore , the mice also showed that their brains responded differently to certain stimuli than they did to other stimuli that they had previously learned to use . Finally , Zhang fennelly found that the HC released dopamine into the brains of the mice , suggesting that this release of dop"
