[ABSTRACT] However , while we move closer to achieving the ambitious target of elimination of transmission ( EoT ) to humans , pockets of infection remain , and it becomes increasingly important to quantitatively assess if different regions are on track for elimination , and where intervention efforts should be focused . We present a previously developed stochastic mathematical model for gHAT in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and show that this same formulation is able to capture the dynamics of gHAT observed at the health area level ( approximately 10 , 000 people ) . This suggests that expanding health area fitting , to cover more of the DRC , should be done with deterministic fits for efficiency , but with stochastic projections used to capture both the parameter and stochastic variation in case reporting and elimination year estimations . The spatial heterogeneity in cases is reflected in modelling results , where we predict that under the current intervention strategies , the health area of Kinzamba II , which has approximately one third of the health zone 's cases , will have the latest expected year for EoT . The analysis focuses on utilising a particle filter Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methodology to fit the model to the data from 16 health areas of Mosango health zone in Kwilu province as a case study . The intensification of intervention activities against the fatal vector-borne disease gambiense human African trypanosomiasis ( gHAT , sleeping sickness ) in the last two decades has led to a large decline in the number of annually reported cases . This analysis was the first time any stochastic gHAT model has been fitted directly to case data and allows us to better quantify the uncertainty in our results . We find that fitting the analogous deterministic version of the gHAT model using MCMC has substantially faster computation times than fitting the stochastic model using pMCMC , but produces virtually indistinguishable posterior parameterisation .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In demonstrating that a mechanistic , stochastic infection model can be fitted to different health area data in the DRC , we have added a new framework that can provide highly detailed calibration and projections of future gHAT infections for a range of intervention scenarios . The greater nuance afforded by smaller-scale health area modelling will further refine the ability to accurately forecast future infections for intervention scenarios , allowing policymakers to better understand the cost and impact of proposed interventions . The similarity in fitting stochastic models to data and simulating stochastic models , but using deterministic variants for fitting , validates the approach of previous studies and indicates that stochastic fitting may not always be necessary . The importance of stochastic models however remains clear , in determining the time to elimination of transmission and our uncertainty in this .

[ABSTRACT] We present an approach to achieve these goals based on summarizing spatial relationships in the TME using spatial K functions , and then applying functional data analysis and random forest models to both predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships . Exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups , as well as determining the extent to which this information can predict outcomes such as patient survival or treatment success with emerging immunotherapies , is of great interest . We further used the proposed approach to interrogate two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients . This approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments at both identifying important spatial interactions while also controlling the false discovery rate . Tumor microenvironments ( TMEs ) contain vast amounts of information on patient 's cancer through their cellular composition and the spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations . Moreover , in the face of a large number of cell interactions to consider , we often wish to identify specific interactions that are useful in making such predictions . The methods proposed are publicly available in a companion R package funkycells .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We note , however , that since our approach compares K functions between different groups , rather than against the theoretical K functions associated with complete spatial randomness ( as is typical in other circumstances ) , the lack of underlying spatial homogeneity in the TME for a data set may not be overly problematic . We consider the case in which we compare TME and meta data or clinical data from two different patient groups , and develop a model to identify significant differences between these groups in the distribution of cell phenotypes , protein antigens , or a mixture thereof . Random forest models designed for continuous or survival time analysis exist , e. g. , and metrics such as L2 error can be used in place of the difference function of the OOB and naïve estimates . Consequently , the approach may be useful in methods applied to cell phenotypes based on proteins ( OPAL , MIBI , Phenocycler Fusion ) or transcripts ( Xenium , Cosmx , MERscope ) expression [ 43-49 ] . Furthermore , whilst we have focused throughout this paper on K functions , we note that the methods presented here can be applied to any summary functions from spatial statistics , or indeed any functions in general . For the TNBC data , we compare two groups of tumors that are separated into `` compartmentalised '' and `` mixed '' groups based on the degree of tumor-immune cell interactions . In addition , we note that a c , t ( p , i ) in Eq ( 1 ) , may consist of the raw measured protein expression level for each protein , and may also include other cell information ( e. g. cell size ) . This separation of tumors gives two groups with explicit differences in their TMEs , making a useful data set for the demonstration of our model . We evaluate our approach on simulated data , demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for marked spatial point patterns with known interactions . Our approach could potentially be adapted for analyzing raw protein expression levels via the use of mark-weighted K functions . Whilst such an assumption may be reasonable in some cases , given the complexity of the TME , homogeneity may not always apply . Our model employs a combination of spatial statistics and functional data analysis and is applicable to marked point processes in general . Throughout this paper we have assumed homogeneity of the underlying spatial point processes in defining the K functions used in the model . In addition , the model aims to predict which group a new patient is in using their TME and meta data . Our approach is then applied to TNBC and lung cancer data obtained from multiplexed ion beam imaging . Inhomogenous K functions can be used in an attempt to mitigate the issue of inhomogeneity [ 14-16 , 57 ] . Benefits of the model include general applicability , with few tuning parameters , and easily visualised and interpreted output . The lung cancer data shows our model can also detect lack of differences in cell relationships . Spatial homogeneity is defined such that the intensity of a given mark is independent of spatial location [ 14-16 ] . The model demonstrates good predictive accuracy , and identifies expected specific cell relationships , and interactions of interest . We have also assumed in this paper outcomes which are categorical , or classes in a group . In this paper , we present a novel method for the analysis of data-rich TME spatial data . The model demonstrates a powerful ability to identify important variables while maintaining good predictive power . Further extension of this method to real-valued data , e. g. survival time , is likewise natural . Regardless of how K functions are defined they are amenable to being used in our

[ABSTRACT] In particular , the strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction , followed by selective removal of weak contacts , allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections . To investigate the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms , we combine a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms : ( i ) only spike-timing-dependent plasticity ( STDP ) , ( ii ) only homeostatic structural plasticity ( hSP ) , i. e. , without weight-dependent pruning and without STDP , ( iii ) a combination of STDP and hSP , i. e. , without weight-dependent pruning , and ( iv ) a combination of STDP and structural plasticity ( SP ) that includes hSP and weight-dependent pruning . When weaker contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning , synchrony is achieved with significantly sparser connections than in randomly structured networks in the STDP-only model . We computationally study how neuronal dynamics , synaptic weights , and network structure co-emerge , in particular , during ( de ) synchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbation . These findings may inform future pre-clinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive stimulus modalities aiming at inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms , e. g. , in Parkinson 's disease . To accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing , STDP , and SP , we introduce a simple stochastic SP model , enabling detailed numerical analyses . We compare the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model ( i ) with the desynchronization of models ( iii ) and ( iv ) . With tools from network theory , we reveal that structural reorganization may remarkably enhance the network 's level of synchrony . The latter require stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization . Abnormally strong neural synchronization may impair brain function , as observed in several brain disorders . This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency , degree-degree correlations , and a mixture of degree assortativity .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] As the network progressed through SP iterations , the neurons became increasingly more identical by adding or losing contacts as their firing rates converged to a single target rate with both SP methods ( stochastic and BvOSP ) regardless of weight-dependent pruning , making way for enhanced network synchronization for any value of the probability of weight-dependent pruning , i. e. , Pw ∈ . With BvOSP ( Pw > 0 ) , the dependence of out-degree on the natural firing rate of the neurons in a steady state was different than that with the stochastic SP model since BvOSP identically controlled both in- and out-degrees via firing rate-dependent sprouting of both dendritic and axonal elements , such that the neurons with a natural firing rate close to the target formed fewer dendritic and axonal elements , while our stochastic SP did not directly constrain the out-degree . With the stochastic SP method , the above factors resulted in a strong relationship between the natural firing rate of the neurons and their in- and out- degrees , such that the neurons with higher ( lower ) natural firing rates had more ( fewer ) outgoing and fewer ( more ) incoming contacts , suggesting that effectively the faster neurons ( those projecting densely onto others ) drove the slower ones ( those receiving more inputs ) . BvOSP permits multiple synaptic contacts between any given pair of pre- and post-synaptic partners , but in our stochastic SP , for simplicity , we assumed that a single contact accounts for the overall effect of the presynaptic neuron on its postsynaptic partner , although it can easily be extended to include multiple contacts . Accordingly , beyond the specifically desynchronization-oriented approach mentioned above , our model aims to provide a testbed for further development of stimulation methods that cause long-lasting stimulation effects by reshaping connectivity and related neuronal activity in the presence of different plasticity mechanisms . Accordingly , beyond the specifically desynchronization-oriented approach mentioned above , our model aims to provide a testbed for further development of stimulation methods that cause long-lasting stimulation effects by reshaping connectivity and related neuronal activity in the presence of different plasticity mechanisms . Degree-frequency correlation has been observed in adaptive networks of oscillators where the correlation emerged as a result of either preserving contacts between out-of-phase oscillators while rewiring those between more in-phase ones or due to the dependence of the synaptic weight on the frequency difference between the connected oscillators , accompanied by weight-dependent pruning , similar to the present study . Since the in- and out-degrees of a neuron depended oppositely on its natural firing rate for a sufficiently large diversity in natural firing rates , the networks portrayed a mixture of degree assortativity by becoming in- and out-assortative while remaining disassortative with respect to the opposite degree types of the connected neurons . However , these studies either did not capture the interaction of synaptic weights and structural change by excluding weight-dependent pruning or imposed homeostatic constraints on the node degrees rather than employing an average activity-based hSP rule . Some of the theoretically developed versions of CR stimulation successfully induced long-lasting desynchronizing and/or therapeutic effects in pre-clinical and clinical studies in PD and clinical studies in tinnitus patients as well as in animal models of epilepsy and binge alcohol drinking [ 71-73 , 75-78 , 121-123 ] .

[ABSTRACT] Our results suggest a model in which patterned delta-2-expressing neurons instruct phagocytic progenitors to locally differentiate into glia , presenting a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types . Loss of several delta-2-expressing neuron classes prevented differentiation of the glia associated with them , whereas transplantation of delta-2-expressing photoreceptor neurons was sufficient for glia formation at an ectopic location . Some animals can regenerate large missing regions of their nervous system , requiring mechanisms to restore the pattern , numbers , and wiring of diverse neuron classes . We found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing a Delta-encoding gene , delta-2 , at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems . Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians , but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types . Because injuries are unpredictable , regeneration must be accomplished from an unlimited number of starting points . Coordinated regeneration of neuron-glia architecture is thus a major challenge and remains poorly understood . Planarian glia are specified later from dispersed Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors . In planarians , neurons and glia are regenerated from distinct progenitors .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Whereas neuron-glia choices have been found to be regulated by Notch from a common progenitor in animal development , this work shows that this same pathway can regulate glia specification and differentiation through interaction between mature neurons and an unrelated class of phagocytic progenitors . The modular nature of this coordinated regeneration mechanism could also readily facilitate evolution of new configurations of glia in the nervous system , by any particular neuron population acquiring or losing expression of delta-2 and having access to dispersed phagocytic progenitors . By having the final fate choice for glia be determined in migratory post-mitotic phagocytic progenitors , local signals from neurons interacting with these progenitors can solve these challenges , resulting in precise local coordination of pattern . This mechanism uncovers a novel approach for integrating glia with neurons in a regenerating nervous system , solving the challenge of specifying glia in proper numbers and locations utilizing a Delta-Notch glia-specification signaling process . Ongoing Delta expression in neurons is also required to constitutively maintain the glia state in neighboring glial cells , further supporting the long-term coordination of these cell types ( Fig 4C ) . In the case of neurons and glia , the exact number and position of certain neuron classes can be variable animal-to-animal , or even between the left-to-right sides of the animals ( e. g. , see Fig 3G and 3I ) . How the precise numbers and positions for interacting cells produced from different progenitors can be matched is an important problem in regeneration . Functional nervous system regeneration requires both neurons and glia to be de novo produced and functionally integrated together with the correct pattern . Specific neuron classes are regenerated in proper numbers and in key positions in the nervous system that activate expression of a Delta-encoding gene , delta-2 . Delta then locally interacts with non-neural Notch-1+ mesoderm-like progenitors , triggering local formation of glia from these progenitors . This raises the possibility that Notch has a deeply conserved role in glia specification , regardless of the progenitor source . We uncovered a mechanism by which the regenerative patterning process for neurons is leveraged for regenerating the pattern for glia . Furthermore , glia are produced by a progenitor class that must differentiate at a variety of distinct positions . How pattern formation for these two different cell types is coordinated in regeneration is unknown .

[ABSTRACT] Expression of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells were found to be significantly higher in broad neutralizers during AHI , and associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later . We characterized early gamma-delta ( γδ ) T cell responses starting from pre-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in participants previously characterized for neutralization breadth development . In addition , the levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells was associated with early production of founder virus Env-specific IgM . We found significant differences in γδ T cell surface marker expression in participants that developed neutralization breadth compared to those that did not . Thus , γδ T cells may promote development of neutralization breadth , which has implications for HIV vaccine strategies . Activation of γδ T cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and associated with viral load . New HIV vaccine approaches are focused on eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In this study , we evaluated the frequency and phenotype of γδ T cells longitudinally starting from pre-HIV acquisition and during untreated AHI in participants with or without neutralization breadth , allowing us to evaluate the contribution of γδ T cells to initial control of viral replication and to the promotion of humoral immune responses . In our cohort , the levels of antibodies against PfCSP c-term , indicative of exposure to malaria sporozoite , showed a positive association with CD16 expression on Vδ1+ T cells , suggesting that malaria exposure might contribute to the phenotype of γδ T cells associated with the development of neutralization breadth , but other unidentified factors might also be important . However , the prospective cohort allowed us to show that expression of these two markers was not modulated by HIV-1 and that significant differences were already present pre-HIV acquisition for CD16 and CD57 levels on Vδ2+ T cells . Understanding the mechanism by which γδ T cells promote the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies could help develop strategies targeting these cells to improve vaccine induced humoral immune responses , especially the induction of broad and potent neutralizing antibody to HIV-1 Env . These differences were specific to γδ T cells as we did not observe differences in CD16 nor CD57 levels at any time points on conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells or NK cells between participants who developed neutralization breadth and those who did not . Vδ2+ T cells were depleted from peripheral blood as early as day 18 post first HIV-1 RNA positive test and their frequency was inversely associated with VL , suggesting a direct impact of HIV-1 on these cells . Since neither CD16 nor CD57 expression by Vδ2+ T cells was associated with B cell engagement during AHI , it is possible that these cells have a different mechanism of action compared to Vδ1+ T cells . The distribution of expression level of the markers identified in this study and the associated quantiles were based on a subset of participants that met pre-specified criteria and may differ from that of the general population . However , we did not find an association between sCD14 or sCD163 , two markers of monocyte activation used as surrogate for microbial translocation , and Vδ1 T cells frequency during CHI . Additional studies could benefit from incorporating tissue sample , such as lymph nodes , analysis for γδ T cell responses when evaluating factors that influence the development of neutralization breadth . The frequency of Vδ2+ T cells was lower at day 18 post first HIV-1 positive test in the participants that developed neutralization breadth , probably reflecting the higher peak VL in those participants . This is in accordance with our flow cytometry results showing that co-expression of the activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR during AHI was associated with viral load . Changes in γδ T cell gene expression were more profound around the time of peak VL and were characterized by induction of several interferon or anti-viral related pathways . Microbial translocation has been associated with immune activation during CHI and was suggested to be responsible for the increased frequency of Vδ1+ T cells in SIV infection . CD16 expression by Vδ1+ T cells was associated with B cell engagement during AHI , suggesting that these cells might promote the initial founder-specific naïve B cell response to HIV-1 . In conclusion , we have shown that loss of Vδ2+ T cell occurs early during AHI and is associated with VL while expansion of Vδ1+ T cells occurs later during CHI and is associated with CD4 T cell activation . The pattern of early depletion and activation of Vδ2+ T cells during AHI mirrors what we have previously reported for iNKT cells with the difference that iNKT cell activation was not associated with VL . HCMV has also been reported to contribute to chronic T cell activation in PLWH and to drive the expansion of Vδ1+ T cells in transplant recipients following reactivation and in primary immunodeficiency .

[ABSTRACT] It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner , and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors ( IL-6R and IL-8R ) with a novel bispecific antibody , BS1 , significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer . Bispecific antibodies ( BsAbs ) , which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule , are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects . Here , we describe a quantitative , computational model of the BS1 BsAb , exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design . The spread of cancer from organ to organ ( metastasis ) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths ; however , most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread . However , while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential , elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments . We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complexes . Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition , providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While receptor synthesis , internalization , and degradation were assumed to be negligible in modeling antibodies binding to cultured cells , given the importance of antibody-receptor complex internalization in determining the drug concentration profile and localization within tissues [ 67-69 ] , it would be informative to extend the bivalent binding model presented here to include these processes . IL-8R has not been directly quantified in solid tumors , but it is found on monocytes and neutrophils at levels of 104 to 105 receptors per cell , and it was shown to be up-regulated relative to IL-6R in primary breast cancer tumor samples . Increased ternary complex formation as the free antibody concentration declines demonstrates the impact of avidity in bivalent antibody binding-in the single-receptor-positive cell lines where only one domain is capable of binding , there is no increase in bound receptor after the washout phase ( Fig 4 ) . When one receptor is in excess of the other , as IL-8R was in our IL-6R+/IL-8R+ experimental cell line , we found that binary complexes with the excess receptor will continue to accumulate after the ternary complex concentration reaches steady state due to the consumption of the limited receptor . Our simulations show that when antibody ( either monospecific or bispecific ) is present in excess of the receptor concentration , the less-stable binary complex form is favored ; whereas the ternary complex form is dominant in the window of intermediate antibody concentrations and higher receptor expression levels ( Fig 5E ) . The distance between antigen-binding domains of IgG antibodies generally ranges from 6 to 12 nm [ 54-56 ] , but the arms are joined by a highly flexible hinge region that can allow the arms to reach up to 17 to 18 nm when fully extended . BS1 demonstrated stronger inhibition of migration and decreased metastatic burden in vivo compared to the combination of tocilizumab and 10H2 , and our results suggest that avidity effects may contribute to the underlying mechanism behind the superior performance of the bispecific antibody . The results provided here include specific parameter values for these antibodies for IL-6R and IL-8R , but many of the insights can be applied generally to other bispecific antibodies , and the model itself can be repurposed to analyze other therapeutic systems of interest . Pharmacokinetic models of bispecific antibodies have previously been described , and extending our model to include circulation of the drug and its transport into the target tissue would enable study of the full treatment dynamics for monospecific versus bispecific antibodies . Since we had an experimental data set for our system , we did not need to make assumptions about the relative strength of first versus second binding , and instead estimated independent values for these steps using empirical data . This may be partly reduced by a loss in rotational flexibility and by steric hindrance from other antibody-receptor complexes in the vicinity , but , on balance , we expect the second binding event to be effectively stronger than the first . Modeling multiple cell types with different receptor levels could allow us to quantify how the affinity and avidity effects presented here impact target tissue selectivity and further clarify differences between monospecific and bispecific antibodies . Deploying the model to simulate antibody binding to cells that express one or other or both of the target receptors , and comparing to simulations of combinations of monospecific antibodies , we gleaned insights into the mechanistic differences between these potential treatments . Over the majority of the receptor concentration range tested , the monovalent-restricted antibody binding is independent of the varying receptor level ( Fig 6B ) , indicating that it is specifically the formation of ternary complexes that

[ABSTRACT] Here , we have gained insight into this question through studies of ZYG-8 , a conserved doublecortin-family kinase ; the mammalian homolog of this microtubule-associated protein is upregulated in many cancers and has been implicated in cell division , but the mechanisms by which it functions are poorly understood . During acentrosomal spindle assembly in C. elegans oocytes , microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards away from the chromosomes where they form poles , but then these outward forces must be balanced to form a stable bipolar structure . Importantly , experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion led to excess outward forces within the spindle and suggested a potential role for this protein in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5 . Further , we found that ZYG-8 is also required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte spindle and that kinase activity is required for its function during both meiosis and mitosis . Altogether , our findings reveal new roles for ZYG-8 in oocytes and provide insights into how acentrosomal spindles are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis . We found that ZYG-8 depletion from oocytes resulted in overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects . How forces and dynamics are tuned to create a stable bipolar structure is poorly understood . Although centrosomes help organize spindles in most cell types , oocytes of most species lack these structures . Simultaneously , microtubule dynamics must be precisely controlled to maintain spindle length and organization .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Notably , both of these proposed functions are consistent with ZYG-8 's localization pattern ; ZYG-8 localizes broadly across the spindle , which would enable it to modulate microtubule dynamics at both the poles and midspindle , and it also co-localizes with BMK-1 throughout meiosis , making it plausible that it could also regulate the activity of this motor . One possibility is that the pole defects could be caused by a combination of the proposed effects on microtubule dynamics and spindle forces ; if microtubules become more stable and motors produce excess outward forces , this may cause stress on the spindle structure that could cause the midspindle to bend and the poles to split . Thus , we propose that ZYG-8 plays at least two important roles in C. elegans oocytes : 1 ) ZYG-8 regulates microtubule dynamics , to facilitate the proper turnover of microtubules within the spindle , and 2 ) ZYG-8 influences the activity of motors that walk along those microtubules , to tune the forces that build and stabilize the spindle . Specifically , experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion results in excess outward forces during spindle assembly and ZYG-8 removal from pre-formed monopoles resulted in minus ends being pushed outwards to form multiple poles ( Fig 9C ) . We found that the zyg-8D604N kinase dead mutant had elongated bipolar spindles but did not display some of the other defects observed in the zyg-8 temperature sensitive mutants or following ZYG-8 depletion ; zyg-8D604N spindles largely had organized poles and were not significantly bent . This could be a reason why spindles formed in the absence of ZYG-8 are longer than in wild type oocytes , and why acute removal of ZYG-8 from pre-formed spindles triggers spindle elongation ; globally stabilizing microtubules could cause the spindle to increase in size ( Fig 9B ) . Notably , DCLK1 has been shown to phosphorylate a microtubule associated protein ( MAP7D1 ) to facilitate axon elongation in mouse cortical neurons ; it is possible that ZYG-8 could phosphorylate microtubule regulatory factors in C. elegans oocytes in a similar manner to modulate microtubule dynamics within the spindle . Future studies aimed at elucidating the relationship between ZYG-8 , motors , and microtubule regulatory proteins should be performed to better understand how they work together to create a stable bipolar spindle with properly balanced forces . However , the percentage of multipolar spindles was even higher when ZYG-8 was removed from metaphase-arrested spindles ; we speculate that the arrest may be exacerbating this phenotype by pausing spindles in metaphase where they may be subjected to prolonged spindle forces . Here , we show that kinase activity is important for the function of a DCLK1-family protein during both mitosis and meiosis in an in vivo model , providing evidence that may validate this therapeutic strategy . This is an important finding , since the mammalian homolog of ZYG-8 ( DCLK1/doublecortin-like kinase 1 ) is upregulated in a wide range of cancers , and knockdown studies have suggested that it is required for tumor progression . Moreover , DCLK1 coats dendritic microtubules and is required for kinesin-3-mediated cargo transport into dendrites ; this led to the hypothesis that crosstalk between DCLK1 and motors at the microtubule surface represented a regulatory mechanism for motor-driven cargo transport . This phenotype stands in stark contrast to that seen following dynein depletion ; when dynein was removed from pre-formed monopolar spindles , the entire monopole came apart , dispersing meiotic chromosomes throughout the cytoplasm . Second , monopolar spindles were able to form following double depletion of KLP-18 and ZYG-8 ; these spindles had an organized central pole , suggesting that ZYG-8 is not required for pole formation per se . Doublecortin-family proteins have been shown to bind microtubules directly
[METHODS] ",,969,97,None,"During cell division , centrosomes help organize spindles , but how these forces and dynamics are tuned to create a stable bipolar structure is poorly understood . Here , we have gained insight into this question through studies of ZYG-8 , a conserved doublecortin-family kinase , which is upregulated in many cancers and has been implicated in cell division but the mechanisms by which it functions are poorly understood; the mammalian homolog of this microtubule-associated protein is upregulation in many tumors . Simultaneously , microtubULe dynamics must be precisely controlled to maintain spindle length and organization . During acentrosomal spindled assembly in C . anegypt , the microtubular minus ends are sorted outwards away from the chromosomes where they form poles , while then these outward forces must be balanced to form a stabilizing bipolar shape . Importantly , experiments with monopolar spindels revealed that ZYF-8 depletion led to excess outward force within the spindlet and suggested a potential role for this protein in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5 . Altogether , our findings reveal new roles for ZY G-8 in oocytes and provide insights into how a centrosomal spindLE is stabilized to promote faithful meiosis ."

[ABSTRACT] Secondly , using an interaction quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis , we describe four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank , for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions show attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls . By integrating these data with large-scale T2D GWAS from the DIAMANTE meta-analysis through Mendelian randomization analyses , we find 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D , all spanning lipid-related classes except for Glucose and Tyrosine . In this study , we investigate the interplay between genetics , metabolomics , and T2D risk in the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel composed of 249 metabolites , 92 % of which correspond to lipids ( HDL , IDL , LDL , VLDL ) and lipoproteins . The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis are significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but are not associated with T2D risk , pointing towards consequences of T2D on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels . Finally , through differential level analyses , we find 165 metabolites associated with microvascular , macrovascular , or both types of T2D complications , with only a few discriminating between complication classes . Overall , this work provides a map of the consequences of T2D on Nightingale targeted metabolite levels and on their genetic regulation , enabling a better understanding of the T2D trajectory leading to complications . Circulating metabolite levels have been associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , but the extent to which T2D affects metabolite levels and their genetic regulation remains to be elucidated . Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2D liability , spanning almost all tested classes , including branched-chain amino acids . Of the 165 metabolites , 40 are not causally linked to T2D in either direction , suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We identified 165 associations between metabolite levels and the risk of developing T2D complications , most of which were shared across complication groups with only few , such as creatinine and glycine , being more strongly associated with microvascular than macrovascular outcomes despite smaller sample size of the microvascular group . On the other hand , our findings could be of clinical relevance , as for example the interaction variants identified for the percentages of L_LDL_PL , L_VLDL_TG and L_VLDL_FC in our study are regulators of CETP , a target of lipid-lowering drugs , which have been shown to correlate with diabetes incidence . In this study , we were restricted to the European ancestry DIAMANTE study from 2018 because it was the latest one with summary statistics available without the UKBB samples , which enables us to avoid sample overlap between the exposure and outcome and to limit potential related bias . By performing an agnostic genome-wide scan to look for interaction signals , we have observed that all the interaction variants , which are mQTLs at a population-level , led to a decreased magnitude of metabolite genetic regulation in the T2D patients ' group compared to the control group . In addition to investigating relationships between metabolite levels and T2D , we described for the first time , to our knowledge , differences in their genetic regulation between T2D patients and controls for 14 metabolites , of which four were replicated in an independent cohort . It is to note that in our one-sample forward MR sensitivity analysis restricted to UKBB participants not under statin medication , LDL-related metabolites retained significance with the same direction of effect as in the two-sample MR analyses . Our results need to be extended to non-European populations , which will require global efforts to characterize the genetic regulation of molecular traits in these populations , along with methodological developments to deal with multi-ancestry data , especially in MR studies . Among the 183 metabolites causally affected by T2D liability , we found positive estimates with BCAAs , as well as with alanine and tyrosine , in agreement with previous studies , but we did not find causal effects of BCAAs on T2D risk . These results suggest that deregulated levels of these metabolites are a consequence rather than a cause of the disease , in line with the observations from the bi-directional MR , where evidence is found in the reverse direction for two of these four metabolites . TG levels , which we found to be causally affected by T2D liability and for some of the related percentages significant in our interaction QTL analysis , may therefore contribute to increased glucose levels . Altogether , our results enable a deeper understanding of the metabolic consequences of T2D and provide future directions for the study of the genetic regulation of molecular levels in T2D and its complications to better capture disease trajectory . Lipid-related medication adjusted T2D summary statistics are not available , and even if they were , care should be taken in interpreting results from such MR analyses using adjusted summary statistics due to potential collider bias . The discrepancies observed in our study between the two MR directions , as well as with the risk of complications , highlight the need for further work to better understand disease trajectories of T2D and its complications . On the other hand , variants in the interaction region for S_HDL_FC_pct are QTL variants of the PLTP gene , which is involved in the transfer of phospholipids from triglycerides to HDL and

[ABSTRACT] We hypothesize that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice , reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival . In previous work , we established that collaborative cross ( CC ) mouse line CC061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection ( MRSA , USA300 ) , while CC024 is tolerant . Survival after MRSA infection in the F1 and F2 generations was 65 % and 55 % and followed a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the CC024 increased survival phenotype . C5ar1 and C5ar2 are receptors for the complement factor C5a , an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response by binding to these receptors . To identify host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection , we crossed CC061 mice and CC024 mice to generate F1 and F2 populations . Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) colonizes humans asymptomatically but can also cause opportunistic infections , ranging from mild skin infections to severe life-threatening conditions . In this QTL , the WSB/EiJ ( WSB ) allele was present in CC024 mice and contributed to their MRSA tolerant phenotype . Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in their parents , suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors . We identified a Quantitative Trait Locus ( QTL ) peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection . Two genes , C5ar1 and C5ar2 , have high-impact variants in this region . Resistance is limiting the pathogen burden , while tolerance is limiting the health impact of a given pathogen burden . Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This hypothesis is also consistent with our finding that heterozygotes at these loci survive poorly ( Fig 5B and 5C ) ; a single CC061 allele for one of these receptors may be sufficient to allow activation of the complement system , leading to reduced survival in heterozygotes . Although C5Ra1 and C5Ra2 are targets or receptors for staphylococcal virulence factors Chemotaxis Inhibiting Protein of S. aureus ( CHIPS ) , Panton Valentin Leukocidin ( PVL ) and gamma hemolysin CB ( hlgCB ) in humans , murine neutrophils are resistant to PVL and hlgCB and do not bind CHIPS [ 86-91 ] . Though IL-27 , along with IL-10 , has been shown to enhance nasal colonization and increase susceptibility to S. aureus pneumonia , its role in suppressing inflammation in the later stages of infection may be beneficial in CC024 mice . While we do not understand the mechanism underlying the baseline up-regulation of complement genes , C3 and C4b in CC024 , increased expression of these immune factors may improve CC024 survival by reducing the initial pathogen load . Here , natural variants occurring within the complement system could benefit the host by reducing inflammation and tissue damage in certain situations , thereby increasing the ability of the host to tolerate an infection for longer periods of time . Mice lacking Nod2 ( Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 ) , Myd88 ( Myeloid differentiation primary response protein ) , and Tlr2 ( Toll-like receptor 2 ) are more susceptible to infection with S. aureus than mice expressing these genes . With growing interest in targeting the complement system for developing therapeutics against sepsis [ 100-102 ] , how natural variants of the complement system influence the effects of this system may be a fruitful avenue of future study . In a recent S. aureus vaccination study , increased levels of IL-10 and reduced IL-17 production lowered the efficiency of the vaccine , further supporting important roles for IL-10 in disease outcome after S. aureus infection . IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by both innate and adaptive immune cells , and is a major immunoregulatory cytokine for modulating the production of several other cytokines [ 47-49 ] . Binding of C5a to these receptors results in increased production of several cytokines , chemotaxis of immune cells , intracellular calcium release , and superoxide anion production that results in a cytokine storm damaging vital organs . C5a may be either unable to or bind differentially to , the altered C5ar1 and C5ar2 receptors in CC024 mice , reducing inflammation , reducing the cytokine storm , reducing the resulting tissue damage , and potentially leading to tolerance . To identify the genes needed for CC024 mice to tolerate MRSA infection despite high colonization in some organs , we generated an F2 cross between CC024 and CC061 . These C5ar1 and C5ar2 variants , independently or together , are strong candidates for an important role in the increased survival during MRSA infection of CC024 mice . The increased production of IL-10 by CC061 mice may create an anti-inflammatory state that contributes to reduced survival of these mice during MRSA infection . We chose a susceptible strain and a tolerant strain ( CC024 ) from our previous 7 day MRSA infection screen to identify genomic regions that are involved in these phenotypes . Complement consists of more than 30 proteins in plasma that opsonize bacteria , depositing complement activation products on the bacterial surface and attracting immune cells . Our data suggest that the genetic factors influencing MRSA colonization are well segregated in the F2 generation , and a complex trait controls their interaction . In CC024

[ABSTRACT] The network model also had a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations , with a considerable density at deleterious selection coefficients . Current models of evolution consider additive genotype-phenotype relationships while often ignoring the contribution of gene interactions to phenotypic variance . Our results suggest that the interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects . Using forward-time genetic simulations , we measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models . In this study , we model a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network , the negative autoregulation motif . A key expectation from adaptive walk theory is that the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations is exponential . We found that both models instead harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected . This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity , where correlations among traits constrain adaptation . The tempo and mode of adaptation depends on the availability of beneficial alleles . However , the extent to which networks affect adaptation remains largely unknown . Genetic interactions arising from gene networks can restrict this availability .
[INTRODUCTION]

[DISCUSSION] The utility of our model also extends beyond evolutionary biology , offering valuable insights for interdisciplinary collaborations that aim to integrate molecular biology , computational science , and statistical genetics . We have introduced how networks can generate epistasis , with implications for the evolution of recombination , maintenance of linkage , and the trade-offs between network complexity and adaptability . It offers a robust framework to investigate issues such as the maintenance of genetic variation , the evolution of recombination , and the dynamics of adaptation from both standing variation and de novo mutations . Our network approach contributes methodologically to the field and holds broad applicability to many open questions in evolutionary biology , from quantitative genetics to the mechanisms underpinning adaptability . While promising , it is essential to acknowledge the model 's limitations , particularly concerning its computational demands and simplifications , which future work should aim to address . As detailed systems models of complex traits become increasingly available , our framework can be employed to simulate the evolution of traits based on empirically-described networks . Future work should focus on leveraging this interdisciplinary potential and on exploring more complex genetic networks to better understand how gene interactions constrain evolution . Our study here shows that networks can create complex distributions of fitness effects that differ from additive expectations . Expanding into adaptation by standing variation will further illuminate the role of genetic interactions during polygenic adaptation . Empirical validation through evolutionary experiments will be crucial in assessing our model 's real-world applicability .

[ABSTRACT] We propose a novel , Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses which suggests that they are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration . While animals behave as if they optimally integrate information according to Bayesian probability theory , the implementation of the required computations in the biological substrate remains unclear . Our theory explains various experimental findings on the system and single-cell level related to multi-sensory integration , which we illustrate with simulations . We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule , allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities . A fundamental function of cortical circuits is the integration of information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior . We formally demonstrate that under these assumptions the somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior . In our approach apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials , while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials . These are parametrized by local quantities , the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances . Furthermore , we make experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] ( ii ) Synaptic plasticity for certainty learning : to test whether the mean and variance of the somatic potential can be learned by dendritic input , one may consider extracellular stimulation of mixed excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic afferents of a neuron while clamping the somatic potential to a fluctuating target . Extending this predictive view , we argue that dendrites themselves can be seen as performing a dendritic 'opinion pooling ' , namely forming dendritic opinions on the stimulus feature , weighting them according to their reliability , and predicting the somatic opinion that is imposed by the teacher input . Our plasticity rule predicts that initially , when the mean of the target distribution is not yet matched , excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strengths move in opposite directions , i. e. , one increases , the other decreases , to jointly match the average somatic membrane potential to the target potential ( cf . Our framework demonstrates that the conductance-based nature of synaptic coupling may not be an artifact of the biological substrate , but rather enables single neurons to perform efficient probabilistic inference previously thought to be realized only at the circuit level . ( i ) Certainty representation within a neuron : in response to individual whisker touches , our model implies that the somatic potential of somatosensory neurons is driven towards a stimulus-specific reversal potential ; this is consistent with measurements in mouse barrel cortex ( Fig 5 ) . Cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons have also been described to be driven by two classes of inputs , with general 'top-down ' input on apical dendrites that predicts the 'bottom-up ' input on basal dendrites . Our plasticity rule naturally accommodates the relative reliabilities of different pathways by scaling up the relative weights of reliable inputs , i. e. , those that have a high correlation to target potentials for given presynaptic activities . This causes visual cues to have a smaller effect on the somatic membrane potential , and thus , over the course of learning , the firing rate of the bimodal condition should become more similar to the tactile-only condition . Depending on the nature of the top-down input , learning can be thus interpreted as target matching or-in the absence of targets-as a regularization of the cortical representation similar to prior matching in variational autoencoders . Thus , the pre-stimulus variability of the somatic potential decreases , which in turn reduces the CV ( coefficient of variation ) of PSP amplitudes upon stimulation ( consistent with experimental data , cf . An extended model , which could also describe the influence of backpropagation action potentials necessary for learning , is a promising direction to further reduce the gap to biophysical dynamics . We demonstrated that the dynamics of conductance-based neuron models naturally computes posterior distributions from Gaussian likelihood functions and prior represented in dendritic compartments . For high frequencies , i. e. , small inter-stimulus intervals , the total evoked conductance remains large and the somatic potential `` sticks '' more to the corresponding reversal potential between stimuli . ( iii ) Cross-modal suppression : consider a setting similar to in which an animal receives mismatched visual and vestibular cues about a quantity of interest ( cf . In our framework , to read out the reliability of a single neuron , postsynaptic neurons either have to average across time or across a population of neurons that encode the same feature . In the broader context of our Bayesian framework , this view suggests that synaptic plasticity tries to match bottom up input to top-down expectations . Moreover , the model also predicts that the variability of cumulative PSP amplitudes ( jumps in the postsynaptic membrane potential following a whisker touch ) depends on the frequency of whisker touches . According to the biophysics of neurons , the overall somatic opinion is then formed by the certainty-weighted dendritic opinions , and this is what the somatic

[ABSTRACT] Using our Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains ( ECOD ) from experimental structures as a basis for classification , we describe the detection and cataloging of domains from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database . Additionally , we compare the sampling of homologous groups from this whole proteome set against our stable ECOD reference and discuss groups that have been enriched by structure predictions . On average , we can provide positive classification ( either of domains or other identifiable non-domain regions ) for 90 % of residues in all proteomes . We enumerate those highly populated domains that are shared in both eukaryotes and bacteria , such as the Rossmann domains , TIM barrels , and P-loop domains . In addition to containing a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains , eukaryotes show a higher proportion of repeated proteins , both globular and small repeats . We classified 746 , 349 domains from 536 , 808 proteins comprised of over 226 , 424 , 000 amino acid residues . Finally , we discuss the implication of these results for protein target selection for future classification strategies for very large protein sets . Large-scale domain annotation of these predictions can aid in the development of biological insights . Protein structure prediction has now been deployed widely across several different large protein sets . We examine the varying populations of homologous groups in both eukaryotes and bacteria .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] With even larger data sets ahead of us in the future , we consider broader representative sets encompassing the entire known protein universe , or classifications from multiple versions of the same computational method , or different methods altogether , we will need to tighten our criteria for selection to include only proteins representative of large clusters of unclassified proteins . Although the number of structures has dramatically increased in the intervening years ( from 94 , 914 to 179 , 295 ) and the fraction of domains in ECOD coming from EM structures also has increased ( from 1 % to 9 % ) , we did not observe a significant change in the relative ranks ( by non-redundant F70 population ) of the most populated homologous groups resulting from this change in methodological focus ( Fig 4B ) . A principal difference between the eukaryotic and bacterial populations is that in eukaryotes the selective pressure against repetition and duplication is lower , and the differences between most populated eukaryotic and bacterial homologous domains reflect those homologous groups that are found repetitively ( i. e. , as multiple neighbors within the same protein ) in eukaryotes such as the Igl domains , ARM repeats , and BBA and RING Zn fingers . The lower classification rate for domains in eukaryotes from AFDB predicted proteomes has previously been observed and is likely due to some combination of prediction errors as well as contextual errors from regions that are only structured in the context of the correct higher-order multi-domain protein or protein complex . The all-α class is dominated by the α bundle architecture within which we find homologous groups of the Armadillo ( ARM ) repeats , Helix-turn-helix ( HTH ) domains , G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCR ) , major facilitator superfamily ( MFS ) transporters , and Histone-like ( Hist ) domains present in the 20 most populated homologous groups ( Fig 2B ) . By performing these classifications , making them publicly available , and showing the convergence of our classification with other types of classifications , we have shown that predicted structures can be classified in a high-throughput method and that a hybrid domain classification of experimental and computationally predicted structures can add to the broader base of scientific knowledge . Domains with low secondary structure or where their evolutionary context is best understood through sequence or non-SSE mediated interactions ( e. g. , disulfide bonds or metal binding sites ) such as the zinc finger transcription factors can be difficult to assign without a family-specific treatment . The structure of solute carrier family 45 member 3 ( Fig 5C , UNP : Q96JT2 ) has an MFS domain pair but only the N-terminal domain is annotated by InterPro , the C-terminal domain contains a large disordered low-confidence insertion which likely prevents its detection by sequence methods . The domain classification of these proteomes was performed to determine the balance of homologous groups in different organisms , to develop techniques for broadly filtering low-confidence and poorly assigned domains from the final sets , and to establish the performance of both AlphaFold and DPAM on different domains of life . Among the bacterial H-groups , ( Fig 4D ) the HTH , P-loop , and MFS domains showed a significant increase with respect to the experimental reference , whereas Rossmann folds , TIM barrels , and Class 1 glutamine amidotransferase-like domains showed a slight but significant decrease in relative population in the predicted domains compared to the experimental reference . Fibronectin-binding protein B ( FnBnpB ) is an example of a prediction wherein much of the protein ( formed of small repeats ) is predicted with low confidence or disordered , but the Igl recognition domains are well-formed and possess a clear topological link to other β-sandwiches

[ABSTRACT] Together , these findings suggest a model for polyomavirus replication , where robust viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and that BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication . The current model is that BKPyV expresses TAg ( large T antigen ) early during infection , promoting cells to enter S phase where the viral DNA can access the host replication machinery . By using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication , we show that both TAg expression and viral production rely on an initial S phase . We found that these subsequent rounds of replication of the host DNA relied on canonical host cell cycle machinery and regulators despite BKPyV infection . BKPyV is known to promote cellular re-replication , where the cell re-enters S phase from G2 phase ( without passing through mitosis or G1 phase ) to prolong S phase for viral replication . Here , we performed a single-cell analysis of viral TAg expression throughout the cell cycle to reveal that robust TAg expression required replication of the host DNA first . Having a better understanding of the molecular events that are required for BKPyV production will help identify effective therapeutic targets against BKPyV . BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure , for which there are no antivirals . Thus , BKPyV infection results in cells with greater than 4N DNA content .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While we did not find that BKPyV infection increased MAPK activation following attachment ( S5 Fig ) nor did we observe any difference in S phase induction until > 24 hours post-infection ( Fig 1 ) , it is possible that a later step during infection , such as escape from the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear entry , activates MAPK to drive the initial S phase prior to BKPyV transcription . While the timing of origin firing preceding DDR activation explains how new origins of replication are licensed and fired during a BKPyV infection , it raises the question as to how an initial mitosis is blocked if DDR is not activated until after re-replication has begun . Additionally , inhibiting host replication did not result in the accumulation of TAg expression in the G1/early S phase population , but prevented robust TAg expression all together and reduced viral titers ; demonstrating that TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase . Although , we can not rule out the possibility that low levels of TAg are sufficient to promote S phase by inhibition of pRb , we posit that low TAg levels are unlikely to promote S phase given that the human genome contains 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 E2F1 binding sites . While our data agree that TAg expression is observed before the viral capsid proteins , the cells robustly expressing TAg were in late S/G2 rather than G1 even at early times post-infection . While we have shown here that the cell cycle-specific accumulation of TAg is independent of proteasomal degradation and is insensitive to viral genome numbers , the mechanism underlying the rapid increase in TAg remains unclear . Our new model shares similarities with other small DNA tumor viruses while accounting for a major difference in BKPyV , which expresses the viral helicase and cell cycle regulatory domains in a single protein . Instead , our data supports a new model whereby BKPyV requires an initial host S phase to replicate , which aligns better with the other small DNA tumor viruses such as papilloma- and adenoviruses . Indeed , mRNA splicing regulation is known to vary across the cell cycle and the TAg variant , truncated large T antigen ( truncTAg ) , contains the pRb binding domain that could drive an initial S phase induction . Alternatively , the sudden expression of TAg in G2 may mimic an endocycling signal in RPTEs by providing the rapid inhibition of pRb and the subsequent expression of new S phase proteins such that the inhibition of mitosis is caused by the onset of re-replication . Furthermore , TAg expression was not the result of genome amplification during an initial S phase , since infecting with up to 80-fold more virions per cell still did not result in TAg+ cells in G1/early S phase . However , our single-cell techniques resolved these discrepancies by identifying a G2-like state wherein licensing may occur outside of S phase and suggested temporal separation of origin firing with DDR activation . Taken together , our findings support a new model by which early S phase is induced during viral infection by either low levels of TAg expression or the expression of other TAg splice variants ( Fig 6 ) . Given that licensing of origins should not occur in S phase and origin firing should be inhibited by the DDR , we were similarly surprised to find that host origin licensing and firing appeared to behave canonically during BKPyV infection . While TAg expression would promote S phase transcription , it is less clear how mitotic suppression is occurring as robust DDR activation was observed after the onset of re-replication . Since re-replication is rare in uninfected RPTEs and activation of the DDR is known to prevent DNA
[METHODS] ",,944,96,None,"BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure , for which there are no antivirals . The current model is that the virus expresses TAg ( large T antigen ) early during infection , promoting cells to enter S phase where the viral DNA can access the host replication machinery . By using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication , we show that both TAG expression and viral production rely on an initial S phase . We found that these subsequent rounds of replication of the host DNA relied on canonical host cell cycle machinery and regulators despite BKpyV infection . Together , these findings suggest a model for BK PyV replication ."

[ABSTRACT] While most existing TWAS approaches focus on marginal analyses through examining one gene at a time , recent developments in TWAS fine-mapping methods enable the joint modeling of multiple genes to refine the identification of potentially causal ones . FABIO employs a probit model to directly link the genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) of genes to binary outcomes while taking into account the GReX correlation among all genes residing on a chromosome . Here , we present FABIO , a TWAS fine-mapping method specifically designed for binary traits that is capable of modeling all genes jointly on an entire chromosome . Leveraging its improved power , FABIO successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases , including GATA3 for asthma , ABCG2 for gout , and SH2B3 for hypertension . We performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of FABIO and applied it for in-depth analyses of six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank . However , these fine-mapping methods have primarily focused on modeling quantitative traits and examining local genomic regions , leading to potentially suboptimal performance . Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) . As a result , FABIO effectively controls false discoveries while offering substantial power gains over existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches . In the real datasets , FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27 . Overall , FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits . 9 % over existing approaches across traits . 9 % -36 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While requiring individual-level data may restrict the application of FABIO , it helps mitigate biases commonly observed in methods that make use of only GWAS summary statistics in the presence of a LD matrix mismatch between the reference panel and the analyzed GWAS data . Unlike existing approaches , FABIO not only incorporates a probit model to capture the binary nature of disease traits but also jointly models all genes on the same chromosome to account for GReX correlation across genes in different LD blocks . Secondly , similar to FOCUS and FOGS , FABIO adopts a two-stage fitting strategy for TWAS fine-mapping : it relies on a reference eQTL mapping study to construct the gene expression prediction model in the first stage , and applies the SNP weights inferred in the eQTL mapping study to construct GReX in the GWAS data for TWAS fine-mapping in the second stage . First , we calculated the pairwise correlation of GReX for four distinct groups of gene pairs : those within each LD block , between two adjacent LD blocks , between two distant LD blocks , and between one LD block on chromosome 1 and one on chromosome 2 , with the latter serving as a baseline . Second , for all six binary traits examined in our real data analysis , we computed the proportion of phenotype variance ( R2 ) explained by GReX using linear regression in two ways . Indeed , in our simulations , we verified that FABIO retains reasonable power even when there are model misspecifications , such as using a logistic regression to generate binary outcomes . The results suggest that FABIO can effectively capture the relationship between GReX and binary outcomes , even when the assumptions of the probit link function are not precisely met . In particular , FABIO needs to infer a latent liability variable for each individual during the MCMC inference process , which is only feasible with individual-level GWAS data . Although the interpretation and inference algorithms differ between these two binary outcome modeling approaches , they often produce similar association results in most application settings . An important future direction is to extend FABIO towards joint likelihood-based inference for TWAS fine-mapping , thus accounting for the inference uncertainty from the first stage . It is important to acknowledge that GEUVADIS data is collected from whole blood , which may not necessary be the disease relevant tissue for the outcome disease . While the two-stage fitting strategy is convenient and effective , it overlooks the uncertainty in the gene expression modeling in the first stage , potentially leading to power loss . The constructed GReX indeed displays correlation not only within LD blocks but also between neighboring LD blocks , though the correlations decrease with increasing distance . Finally , in our real-world applications , we utilized GEUVADIS data as the eQTL mapping study to fine map the six disease traits . Utilizing multiple eQTL panels from various tissues to construct SNP weights has been proposed to leverage shared eQTL across tissues to enhance the power of TWAS . Through comprehensive simulations and real-world applications to six disease traits in the UK Biobank , we have illustrated the benefits of FABIO . First way , we included the GReX for all genes across 133 LD blocks on chromosome 1 in the model and computed the R2 . Firstly , due to the probit link function , FABIO requires individual-level GWAS data as input and can not directly model GWAS summary statistics . Intuitively , if GReX correlation between LD blocks is negligible , the R2 values obtained from these two approaches should be identical . Second way , we included the GReX

[ABSTRACT] Instead , both amorphous and amyloid Sup35 aggregates are increased in btn2 hsp42 mutants consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress conditions in the absence of sequestrase activity . We have identified the Sup35 translation termination factor as an in vivo sequestrase substrate and show that Btn2 and Hsp42 act to suppress oxidant-induced formation of the yeast [ PSI+ ] prion , which is the amyloid form of Sup35 . [ PSI+ ] prion formation in sequestrase mutants does not require IPOD ( insoluble protein deposit ) localization which is the site where amyloids are thought to undergo fragmentation and seeding to propagate their heritable prion form . When misfolded proteins evade quality control , they can be sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent the potential dysfunction and toxicity that arises from protein aggregation . Btn2 and Hsp42 act to sequester oxidized proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure and their absence leads to an accumulation of protein aggregates . Taken together , our data identify protein sequestration as a key antioxidant defence mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation . We show here that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress conditions induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide . The toxicity of protein aggregate accumulation causes oxidant sensitivity in btn2 hsp42 sequestrase mutants since overexpression of the Hsp104 disaggregase rescues oxidant tolerance . Their exact intracellular functions and substrates are not well defined , particularly since heat stress sensitivity is not observed in deletion mutants . Btn2 and Hsp42 are compartment-specific sequestrases that play key roles in the assembly of these deposition sites . Misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] De novo prion formation following protein oxidation depends on IPOD localization which acts as a sorting centre determining whether oxidized proteins are cleared via autophagy , or alternatively , form heritable protein aggregates ( prions ) , dependent on Hsp104 ( Fig 7 ) . Our model is that soluble proteins , such as Sup35 , undergo misfolding in response to oxidative damage , and the oxidatively damaged proteins are normally triaged by Btn2 and Hsp42 to the various protein deposit sites in cells ( Fig 7 ) . Secondly , chaperones and other anti-prion systems may become overwhelmed by the high levels of non-specific protein aggregates present in btn2 hsp42 mutants meaning they are not available to suppress [ PSI+ ] prion formation . Peroxiredoxins normally act as antioxidant enzymes that detoxify hydroperoxides , but can also become hyperoxidized in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure which triggers a switch to high molecular weight structures with chaperone activity . These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive and are analogous to the cross-seeding and titration models that have been proposed to explain the requirement for [ PIN+ ] in de novo induction of [ PSI+ ] formation . For example , Hsp42 is required for the formation of cytosolic granules , termed MitoStores , which are formed in response to mitochondrial dysfunction in yeast and act to store various proteins including mitochondrial precursor proteins until the stress is relieved . We focussed on the Sup35 protein in this current study since oxidative damage to Sup35 has been shown promote Sup35 aggregation as well as being an important trigger influencing the formation of heritable [ PSI+ ] prions . We found that Hsp104 suppressed the high levels of protein aggregation formed in the btn2 hsp42 mutant following ROS exposure consistent with the idea that the Hsp104 disaggregase normally acts to resolve spatially sorted protein aggregates that are formed following oxidant exposure . There are a plethora of anti-prion systems present in yeast that may be sufficient to maintain the low frequency of [ PSI+ ] prion formation that occurs during non-stress conditions even in sequestrase mutants . The elevated frequency of oxidant-induced [ PSI+ ] prion formation in btn2 hsp42 mutants did not require IPOD localisation since it was unaffected in cortical actin mutants which have previously been shown to disrupt Sup35 IPOD localisation . The finding that mutants lacking Btn2 and Hsp42 are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress , but not heat stress , suggests a more direct functional requirement for these sequestrases during stress conditions that promote protein oxidation . The irreversible nature of many types of protein oxidation may also require sequestration as a strategy to prevent protein aggregates from accumulating at non-specific sites as we observed in btn2 hsp42 mutants . The oxidant-induced , increased Sup35 aggregation detected in btn2 hsp42 mutants required the Sup35 PrD which has previously been implicated in the formation of non-amyloid Sup35 phase separated aggregates during nutrient depletion stress conditions . Hence , it is possible that the mechanistic differences in protein misfolding and aggregation caused by heat and oxidative stress accounts for the differential requirements for sequestrases during these different stress conditions . However , there is clearly redundancy in the nucleation of Sup35 by Btn2 or Hsp42 since both Sup35 aggregate formation and the frequency of prion formation , was elevated in btn2 hsp42 mutants compared with btn2 or hsp42 single mutants . Our data identify the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases as key chaperones required for oxidant tolerance that are required to sequester misfolded proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure . Hsp42 has been shown to direct protein sequestration

[ABSTRACT] We leveraged CRISPR-interference ( CRISPRi ) to evaluate invasive function of GBM-associated lncRNAs in an unbiased functional screen , characterizing and exploring the mechanism of identified candidates . RNAseq analysis of LINC03045 knockdown revealed that WASF3 , previously implicated in tumor invasion studies , was highly correlated with lncRNA expression , while WASF3 KD was associated with significant decrease in invasion . Mediators of lncRNA effect were identified via differential expression analysis following lncRNA KD and assessed for tumor invasion using knockdown and rescue experiments . Glioblastoma ( GBM ) invasion studies have focused on coding genes , while few studies evaluate long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) , transcripts without protein-coding potential , for role in GBM invasion . Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and Genotype-Tissue Expression ( GTEx ) survival analysis . 7 % decrease in tumor cell invasion upon knockdown , while LINC03045 expression was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade . We implemented a CRISPRi lncRNA loss-of-function screen evaluating association of lncRNA knockdown ( KD ) with invasion capacity in Matrigel . Top screen candidates were validated using CRISPRi and oligonucleotide ( ASO ) -mediated knockdown in three tumor lines . RNA-seq and mechanistic studies suggest that this novel lncRNA may regulate invasion via WASF3 . Finally , WASF3 overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive function lost with LINC03045 KD . The top candidate , LINC03045 , identified from effect size and p-value , demonstrated 82 . CRISPRi screening identified LINC03045 , a previously unannotated lncRNA , as critical to GBM invasion . Forty-eight lncRNAs were significantly associated with 33-83 % decrease in invasion ( p < 0 . Gene expression is significantly associated with tumor grade and survival . 01 ) upon knockdown .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In addition , because lncRNAs have been commonly characterized as extremely abundant and specific to a small subset of cells , another possible explanation is that gene expression was particularly abundant in an aggressive , invading , lncRNA-rich subpopulation is capable of demonstrating invasion at 24 hours during the assay . Additionally , given the technical challenges of conducting long-term lentiviral knockdown of lncRNAs in vivo , including target specificity and the instability of lentiviral transduction of the LINC03045 knockdown , we have chosen to utilize 3D invasion assays as an approximation of in vivo behavior , which allowed for stable , continuous knockdown of LINC03045 via ASO [ 53-55 ] . When evaluating the intersection between differential gene expression in LINC03045 KD in vitro and LINC03045 expression changes in vivo ( in the TCGA ) , we noted an overlap of 16 out of the 36 differentially expressed genes in vitro , with significant alterations in GO pathways in cell shape and neural crest cell migration ( S1 Table ) . Prior studies have found that aberrations in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation could contribute to GBM aggressiveness and invasion and that an acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironment can promote tumor invasion by changing glycolytic flux , thus promoting local protumorigenic inflammatory responses . While prior manuscripts have notably focused on the role of coding genes affecting glioma invasion , the body of literature characterizing the role of lncRNAs in GBM pathogenesis has only just begun to grow in recent years and have primarily focused on the role of lncRNAs in GBM proliferation and progression [ 33-37 ] . Notably , our experimental data was also confirmed to be clinically relevant , as TCGA and GTEx analysis showed that LINC03045 expression is higher in GBM ( grade 4 ) than in LGG ( grades 2-3 ) , and higher in LGG when compared to normal cortical tissue . Although CRISPR/Cas9 is a robust tool to target lncRNAs , major limitations include risk of affecting adjacent genes , including those that overlap with the lncRNA gene or elements in the lncRNA locus that may regulate other genes . While we demonstrated consistent phenotype and downstream changes in multiple cell lines , including a recently derived patient tumor line , and included a 3D invasion assay as well , further comprehensive screens may include screening of more patient lines . While lncRNA-based prognostic and diagnostic markers and lncRNA-based therapeutics described above are still in their experimental stages , the study of lncRNAs often offers insight into mechanisms regulating tumor phenotypes such as , in our study , invasion . While future studies must characterize the specific mechanism by which LINC03045 modulates WASF3 expression , as well as the role of LINC03045 using in vivo models , our results show that LINC03045 has an important role in GBM invasion . ASOs are single-stranded nucleotide strands that are taken up freely by cells to form heteroduplexes with the complementary target RNA , designating them for degradation , and can offer a potential treatment option . However , a true in vivo knockdown study of LINC03045 is needed in further studies to corroborate our results , since in vivo models are still the most accurate method for studying tumor behavior and environmental interactions . Patient gene expression analysis of TCGA , and GTEx raw transcriptional data revealed that LINC03045 expression was associated with tumor grade and patient survival , as well as widespread changes in global gene expression data , including oxidative phosphorylation and RNA processing .

[ABSTRACT] We address this issue by using a new clustering procedure for sets of electroencephalographic ( EEG ) data recorded from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain . This clustering procedure indicates that the brain uses the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus in order to build a model .

It has been classically conjectured that the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli .

[ABSTRACT] While single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) is a popular method to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution , it harbors shortcomings : The failure to account for cell-to-cell variations of transcriptome-size ( i. e. , the total number of transcripts per cell ) and also cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression . Their fidelity is validated by more accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data of diverse solid organs using the scRNA-seq data and the cWFs of their composite cells . Here , we introduce a concept and a method of its computation and report cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs . This is particularly a problem when analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues/organs , which requires cell dissociation for the analysis . Our study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues/organs . Furthermore , we also show that cWFs effectively predict aging-progression , implicating their diagnostic applications and also their association with aging mechanism . To fix this problem , we propose a computationally calculated coefficient , `` cell type-specific weighting-factor ( cWF ) `` . As a result , there exists a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq result and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq result using its composite scRNA-seq data . Furthermore , our findings suggest a diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] We show that they indeed account for the relative variations of the transcriptome-size of the cells and their differential cryptic gene expression by demonstrating their requisite role for accurately reconstituting and deconvolving the whole-organ RNA-seq data using their composite scRNA-seq data weighted by the corresponding cWFs ( Figs 4-6 ) . Furthermore , we show at least one example where the expected pathological changes of the cell-type ratio of the heart can be predicted using the cWFs derived from the healthy control heart ( S8 Fig ) , despite a bias introduced by this reference data . In this study , we report a computational method to calculate cWFs , coefficients to offset the lack of the representation of transcriptome size variations and differential cryptic gene expression among different cells of solid organs ( Fig 2 ) . Furthermore , we show that cWFs differentially change among diverse cell-types across various organs over the course of aging and can be used to effectively predict aging progression in the aging mouse model ( Figs 8-10 ) . Another requirement is that the method needs at least a rough a priori knowledge about the cell-type compositions ( i. e. , the ratio of cell-types ) of the organs and the tissue of interest -i. e. , the method works only in a supervised framework . While our method is effective for the organs consisting of heterogeneous cell-types , it is ineffective for a relatively homogenous organ such as the liver consisting of predominantly hepatocytes ( > 95 % ) ( Figs 3 , 5 , S4 , and S5 ) . Once we determine the cWFs for the specific cell-types of organs , the same cWFs can be used for the same cell-types of the corresponding organs derived from other independently-generated datasets ( i. e. , regardless of their sources ) . This limitation could also become less limiting as a growing body of scRNA-seq data provides information on the cell-type compositions of previously less characterized organs/tissues . Therefore , the cWFs reported in this study can be used for the same 76 cell-types and 10 organs for other studies . Another limitation could be the requirement of both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data of the organs and the tissues of interest . Our method requires both of these datasets for the target organs/tissues to infer the cWFs of the composing cell-types . We also show that they recapitulate the experimentally-determined total mRNA content-differences , using PBMC data ( Fig 7 ) . The results also indicate their possible diagnostic applications as biomarkers for aging progression and/or aging associated diseases . However , this may become less of a limiting factor as the availability of such data is exponentially growing . Using this method , we computed and describe cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 organs ( Fig 3 ) . These results suggest a possible role of differential transcriptome size-change in the aging mechanism . Despite the usefulness of cWFs , some limitations must be noted .

[ABSTRACT] In combination with simulated examples , we highlight how important features of MVMR analyses can be explored using a range of tools incorporated within the RMVMR R package . MR and MVMR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants in the set used as instrumental variables , violating one of the core IV assumptions . We propose a radial formulation of MVMR , and an adapted Galbraith radial plot , which allows for the estimated effect of each exposure within an MVMR analysis to be visualised . Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a statistical approach using genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome . We present simulations that illustrate how outlier removal decreases the bias in estimated effects under various forms of pleiotropy . Radial MVMR effectively visualises causal effect estimates , and provides valuable diagnostic information with respect to the underlying assumptions of MVMR . Radial MVMR additionally includes an option for removal of outlying SNPs which may violate one or more assumptions of MVMR . We highlight how outliers with respect to all exposures can be visualised and removed through Radial MVMR . Analogous plots for MVMR have so far been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature of the analysis . We apply Radial MVMR to estimate the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Multivariable MR ( MVMR ) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simulatiously . Genetic variants that give outlying estimates are often considered to be potentially pleiotropic variants . We demonstrate the effectiveness of the radial MVMR approach through simulations and applied analyses . A RMVMR R package is presented as accompanying software for implementing the methods described . Radial plots can be used in MR to help identify these variants .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] This issue , which is a wider issue within the summary MR literature , warrants careful consideration prior to performing analyses , and care should be taken in evaluating as an indicator of pleiotropy when a binary outcome is used . We propose that the radial MVMR approach be used to assist in communicating key findings as a visual aid , and also as a sensitivity analysis for identifying pleiotropic bias using adjusted heterogeneity statistics . It is with this in mind that a general heterogeneity pruning function has not been incorporated within the RMVMR R package , though code for performing such analyses is available at https : //github . When using SNP-outcome associations estimated on a log-odds scale , it is possible that causal estimates will be correlated with their precision , introducing heterogeneity which is not a consequence of pleiotropic associations . Heterogeneity in per SNP effect estimates can arise due to mechanisms other than horizontal pleiotropy , for example tissue specificity in the SNP effects will lead to heterogeneity when the samples are taken from a single tissue . Such weights may prove more effective than first-order weights , as they incorporate the precision of SNP-exposure estimates mitigating violations of the NO-Measurement Error ( NOME ) assumption in summary MR . If a majority of instruments have direct effects upon an outcome , and the distribution of such direct effects is similar , it is likely that SNPs satisfying the MVMR assumptions will be identified as outliers . Decisions to down weight or remove outliers during an analysis should be made with consideration of the biological mechanisms underlying observed SNP-phenotype associations , and adequate justification . Radial MVMR builds upon both these existing methods , providing a means for visualising MVMR approaches absent until this point , and an approach of outlier identification and removal in a MVMR framework . Finally , it should be noted that while first-order weights have been used throughout this paper , radial approaches allow for a wide-range of weighting options to be used . Conducting analyses within a radial framework allows for outliers to be effectively visualised , and MVMR analyses allow for the direct effects of multiple exposures to be estimated simultaneously . As demonstrated in the simulation study , if the majority of the SNPs have pleiotropic effects in the same direction the outlier adjusted Radial MVMR estimates will still be biased . As previously emphasised , care should be taken to consider identified outliers and phenotypic associations which could plausibly form horizontal pleiotropic pathways . Instruments selected should be sufficiently strong so as to overcome substantial weak instrument bias , estimated using the conditional F-statistic . Radial MR and MVMR approaches facilitate the assessment of pleiotropic associations between genetic variants and phenotypes using GWAS summary data . Specific to Radial MVMR , the correction of individual ratio estimates is reliant upon unbiased estimates of the direct effect of each exposure . As a consequence , the removal of such SNPs would result in estimates converging toward the biased estimate produced by such pleiotropic SNPs . As arbitrary weights can be used , should be possible for modified second order weights to be incorporated with a radial MVMR model . A further issue related to the applied analysis is the use of binary outcomes in summary MR analyses . Future work will explore how differing weight specifications can improve estimation using radial MVMR . When implementing the Radial MVMR approach it is crucial to consider the underlying assumptions of MVMR . com/WSpiller/RMVMR_Analyses .

[ABSTRACT] Using our holistic measurements of behavior , we find that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies ' daily pattern of behavior , and that the behavioral composition of this hour tracks well with other indicators of health such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spend moving vs. resting . We find distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors , adding specific information about trends in different grooming modalities , proboscis extension duration , and locomotion speed to what is known about the D. melanogaster circadian cycle . To access longer timescales of behavior , we continuously recorded individual Drosophila melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless arenas on sucrose-agarose media . The method , data , and analysis presented here give us a new and clearer picture of D. melanogaster behavior across timescales , revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms . We identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming , proboscis extension , and locomotion and use the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies ' behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment . We use the deep learning framework SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances . Animal behavior spans many timescales , from short , seconds-scale actions to daily rhythms over many hours to life-long changes during aging .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] While the study presented here does not carry out the necessary genetic and lighting perturbations , it would be interesting to see if locomotion time and locomotion speed are independently controlled mechanisms that together contribute to the typical morning and evening peaks of behavior in D. melanogaster . By leveraging recent advances in GPU-based video processing and postural inference , we captured the behavior of freely moving D. melanogaster over the course of multiple days , encompassing the behavioral effects of daily rhythms , starvation , aging , and habituation at continuous high resolution . The analyses presented here leverage only a fraction of the resolution and dimensionality provided by our data , and we hope this 100-fold increase in the amount of high-quality ethological data available will give rise to yet more tools and techniques . While in this study we can not distinguish between feeding and sleep associated proboscis extensions , we hypothesize that the increased bout duration during night hours is associated with a deep sleep mode that flies are achieving more frequently at night . This dataset is also the first to continuously capture high dimensional , high-resolution behavioral data across a diurnal cycle , allowing us to investigate how changes in internal state related to time of day affect behavior . Future work with new arenas , food sources , and improved environmental control can extend this type of high-resolution behavioral recordings to cover a broad set of use cases across even longer timescales . Our ability to distinguish these fine-grained behaviors allows us to see changes in specific grooming modalities with time of day , and track how flies gradually lose their ability to walk normally with age and stress . We used our high resolution postural data in combination with fine-grained ethograms to characterize changes in proboscis extension bout duration across time of day , finding an average increased bout duration during night hours . With compositional data analysis techniques , we identified the hour after lights on as a unique time point in the daily pattern of behavior , with increased levels of all three measured grooming modalities . With our combination of postural tracking and unsupervised behavioral classification we are able to specify behaviors at a higher level of granularity , such as different grooming modalities and locomotion states . By investigating locomotion speed specifically during locomotion bouts , we find that locomotion speed , in addition to the fraction of time spent locomoting , has a daily pattern that matches the pattern of activity found in previous circadian studies . Previous studies have succeeded in separating out small and/or peripheral motions from long locomotion bouts and quiescence by using machine vision and supervised behavior classifiers . Other work has focused on additional metrics to specifically characterize locomotion activity across days , such as angular velocity or position within an arena . As flies age and die in our experiment , their proboscis extension bout length decreases , perhaps revealing an age- or stress-related attenuation of deep sleep . Our data recapitulates many previously described trends in D. melanogaster diurnal and aging/dying patterns of behavior , while also finding novel features of the daily and lifelong behavior trends . By recording when flies feed ( as measured by proboscis extension ) , this data may also provide new insights into the effects of hunger and satiety . Previous work on the temporal structure of behavior has found correlations extending beyond the length of the available high-resolution data , typically 30-60 minutes . In future work , we will investigate how behavior in the hour after dawn is related to overall health , lifespan , and sleep quality in D. melanogaster . While the overall difference between day and night behaviors decreases constantly across days , the hour after dawn

[ABSTRACT] Through a non-biased genetic screen , we found that loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 ( human NEK8/NEK9 ) and NEKL-3 ( human NEK6/NEK7 ) , which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation . Genetic analysis , co-localization studies , and proximity labeling revealed roles for PTPN-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes , including C. elegans hemidesmosomes , suggesting that PTPN-22 plays a broad role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues . Localization and proximity labeling also implicated PTPN-22 in functions connected to nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation , particularly within the germline , as nearly one-third of proteins identified by PTPN-22 proximity labeling are known P granule components . Protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type ( PTPNs ) have been studied extensively in the context of the adaptive immune system ; however , their roles beyond immunoregulation are less well explored . Here we identify novel functions for the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTPN-22 , establishing its role in nematode molting , cell adhesion , and cytoskeletal regulation . Through this approach we identified the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 ( human DNMBP ) as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22 . To better understand the functions of PTPN-22 , we carried out proximity labeling studies to identify candidate interactors of PTPN-22 during development . Collectively , these studies highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions . Consistent with this interaction , loss of DNBP-1 also suppressed nekl-associated molting defects .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Additionally , it is possible that an interaction between PTPN-22 , nuclear pore complex proteins , and importins could occur in other tissues , as we observed expression of PTPN-22 in nuclear compartments of other cell types including the vulva , pharynx , intestine , and seam cells . Our findings from proximity labeling , molecular modeling , and subcellular localization studies , in conjunction with previously published yeast two-hybrid interaction data , suggest that PTPN-22 may be an accessory component or regulator of this complex . As noted in the results , however , our proximity labeling studies are likely to contain at least some false ( non-specific ) positives , which could include highly abundant proteins such as those acting within cell adhesion complexes . We previously showed that NEKL-2 and NEKL-3 have overlapping but distinct roles in several steps of membrane trafficking including cargo uptake from apical and basolateral membranes along with transit through the endosomal system . Additionally , our genetic experiments revealed a robust genetic interaction between cap-2 and ptpn-22 , as loss of function of both proteins led to a significant increase in embryonic lethality and developmental arrest at early larval stages . DNMBP , the human ortholog of DNBP-1 , regulates actin assembly by serving as a scaffold for CDC42 and WASP family proteins and also binds to dynamin , a membrane-remodeling enzyme that promotes vesicle fission . P granules are well-studied RNP-based membraneless organelles located in the perinuclear region of germline nuclei , where they act to restrict mRNA cytoplasmic import and protein translation [ 64 , 102-104 ] . Further examples of the potential involvement of PTPN-22 in actin regulation come from our proximity labeling experiments , which suggested an interaction between PTPN-22 and several actin capping proteins ( CAP-1 , CAP-2 , and GSNL-1 ) , each of which blocks actin filament elongation . Such a model is consistent with our current and previously published genetic data showing that inhibition of PTPN-22 , DNBP-1 , CDC-42 , and SID-3/ TNK2/ACK1 can suppress nekl molting defects . Nevertheless , by coupling proximity labeling to localization data and functional/genetic studies , our combined results indicate functions for PTPN-22 in the regulation of cell attachments and serve as a basis for future studies . Moreover , previous work on human PTPN22 suggests that this could be a conserved function given that mammalian PTPN22 co-localizes with a T cell-specific integrin , regulates its activity , and affects lymphocyte adhesion . Nevertheless , whereas PP2A could directly reverse NEKL-mediated phosphorylation at serines and threonines , PTPN-22 is predicted to target specifically phosphotyrosines and may thus oppose NEKL functions more indirectly . These results , together with RNAi enhancement studies showing that ptpn-22 mutants are hypersensitive to partial knockdown of CeHD proteins , suggest a role for PTPN-22 in positively regulating the function of CeHD proteins . More specifically , our studies substantially expand upon the known functions of PTPN22 family members beyond the adaptive immune system , including evidence for new molecular , cellular , and developmental functions . PTPN-22 proximity labeling studies also identified several CeHD components ( IFB-1 , PAT-12 , VAB-10 , and LET-805 ) , a finding strongly supported by the observed co-localization between PTPN-22 and IFB-1A , MUP-4 , VAB-10 , and LET-805 . Effectors of CDC42 include conserved members of the WASP and TOCA family of proteins , which together with the Arp2/3 complex promote the extension and branching of actin filaments [ 96-100 ] . CDC42 is a well-studied member of the Rho family of GTPases that promotes actin polymerization within a variety of cellular contexts including multiple roles within the membrane trafficking system . Most notably , nearly one-third of the 179 proteins identified by

[ABSTRACT] We use a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 ( K13 ) gene , which are known to be associated with artemisinin resistance , and a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artemisinin resistance . Our model and maps provide important insights into the spatial and temporal trends of artemisinin resistance in a way that is not possible using data alone , thereby enabling improved spatial decision support systems on an unprecedented fine-scale spatial resolution . By predicting for the first time spatio-temporal patterns and extents of artemisinin resistance at the subcontinent level , this study provides critical information for supporting malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia . Spatial information on the changing levels of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia is therefore critical for health organisations to prioritise malaria control measures , but available data on artemisinin resistance are sparse . Our maps of estimated prevalence show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022 . If artemisinin resistance significantly expands to Africa or India , cases and malaria-related deaths are set to increase substantially . Current malaria elimination targets must withstand a colossal challenge-resistance to the current gold standard antimalarial drug , namely artemisinin derivatives . Moreover , the period between 2010 and 2015 demonstrated the most spatial change across the region .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] With the sparsity of spatial data currently available this poor performance of long-range extrapolation is not unexpected and may be improved as ( 1 ) more spatial data is collected , ( 2 ) modelling methods are improved for example to consider multi-model outputs , and ( 3 ) potential explanatory variables become available at sufficiently high spatiotemporal resolution . However , these factors each have an important mechanistic role to play in the rate of change of artemisinin resistance , which could be modelled by considering another hierarchical layer in the statistical model that relates the level of resistance to , for example , the incidence of Pf malaria during a time interval . This will be possible with a joint statistical framework drawing on all the information available for each of the K13 markers for which the correlation structure between the markers is explicitly modelled ; currently there is very limited data with more than one molecular marker , so a joint model is beyond the scope of this paper with the existing data . Firstly , the timeline from field data collection to publication to data sharing was often long ; consequently , the modelling to provide real-time ( or near real-time ) information for policymakers was dependent on this factor and the willingness of all actors to allow rapid access to relevant data . This paper has presented maps for the prevalence of any of the K13 mutations associated with slow parasite clearance ( as defined in ) , thereby reducing the many markers to a single number of 'positive ' observations for each study site . The consequences of artemisinin resistance may be dire : historically , the emergence and spread of parasites resistant to the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and later SP resulted in dramatic increases in malaria-related morbidity and mortality across sub-Saharan Africa . These maps provide estimates of drug resistance for locations where no data are available and can be used by health agencies to guide the prioritisation of surveillance for resistance and policies to improve treatment and prevent the further spread of resistance . It is worth noting that a pilot project conducted by Mahidol University and the WWARN from 2016 to 2019 had a turn-around time of three months for data upload onto publicly accessible maps . The work presented in this paper significantly advances earlier work by providing predictions of K13 prevalence over the entire Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022 based on a comprehensive dataset of K13 studies conducted in the region . If artemisinin resistance becomes established in Africa , it will likely facilitate the emergence and spread of ACT partner drug resistance , jeopardising the efficacy of ACTs , which will lead to an increase in malaria cases and , ultimately , an increase in malaria-attributable deaths . Almost 200 different candidate mutant genotypes were first established ; meanwhile , a study from WWARN has since identified a refined set of K13 mutant alleles associated with slow parasite clearance-the clinical hallmark of artemisinin resistance . This issue is highlighted by a known downward trend in K13 mutant infections in Cambodia since 2019 -likely driven by the change in first-line treatment-that is yet to be reflected in the data stored in WWARN repositories . The approach presented here can naturally be extended to resistance of partner drugs ( e. g. plasmepsin and PfCRT for piperaquine and PfMDR1 for mefloquine ) to provide insights into ACT resistance , which would be most interesting for policymakers . quantified the spread of K13 propeller mutations with a similar Bayesian model-based geostatistics framework ; however , predictions were only for Myanmar in 2014 and based on the limited amount of available data at the time .

[ABSTRACT] Further functional assay indicated that although DPP9 is involved in the NT-CT complex of rodent NLRP1 and CARD8 , it does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT. Our study enhanced the understanding of the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation and underscored the complexity of their interactions within the immune response . Specifically , the Linker3 region located between LRR and FIIND in murine NLRP1b ( mNLRP1b ) plays an essential role in forming the NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes , while the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ) and CARD8 mediates their NT-CT interaction . These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain , resulting in full-length ( FL ) , cleaved N-terminal ( NT ) , and cleaved C-terminal ( CT ) peptides , which form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state . Function-to-find domain ( FIIND ) -containing proteins , including NLRP1 and CARD8 , are vital components of the inflammasome signaling pathway , critical for the innate immune response . Here , we found that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions , but with distinct mechanisms . In addition , we explored the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 ( DPP9 ) in these complexes , revealing differential interactions and the significance of domain structure . Besides the FL-DPP9-CT complex , DPP9 interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b , rNLRP1 , and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains , forming NT-DPP9-CT complex ; however , DPP9 can not bind to NTs of hNLRP1 . However , the detailed mechanism remains elusive .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The FIIND domain of FL proteins forms a relatively conserved ternary complex with the cleaved CT and the cellular protease DPP9 [ 22-24 ] , while NT utilizes different domains or regions to interact with and inhibit CT ( S4F Fig ) . In conclusion , our research elucidates that the formation of NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes in FIIND-containing proteins constitutes a sophisticated mechanism of regulation , presenting potential avenues for targeted therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with dysregulated inflammasome activation . Both NLRP1 paralogs and the CARD8 inflammasome can be activated by pathogenic proteases through a mechanism termed `` functional degradation '' , whereby these proteases cleave the NT , leading to the degradation of both NT and FL , thus liberating CT for inflammasome assembly [ 9-12 , 17 , 19 ] . Knockout studies indicate that NT retains its inhibitory effect on CT in the absence of DPP9 , and treatment with VbP does not activate the NT-DPP9-CT complex , suggesting that the primary inhibitory action of DPP9 for NLRP1 or CARD8 occurs through the FL-DPP9-CT complex . However , mNLRP1b , rNLRP1 , and CARD8 present a different profile , as both FL and NT can bind DPP9 with similar affinity , and mutations at the cleavage sites do not impact this interaction . Cellular DPP9 has been identified as a critical checkpoint for both NLRP1 and CARD8 inflammasomes through the formation of similar complexes ( FL-DPP9-CT ) , dependent on autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain . Detailed mapping further indicates that the ZU5 subdomain of mNLRP1b , rNLRP1 and CARD8 also binds to DPP9 , suggesting that DPP9 is involved in both FL-CT and NT-CT complexes . DPP9 restricts CT 's activity to prevent inflammasome activation in the FL-DPP9-CT complex , whereas it does not affect CT 's function or NT 's inhibitory activities in the NT-DPP9-CT complex for mNLRP1b , rNLRP1 , and CARD8 . Our findings demonstrate that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes , including NT-CT and FL-CT interactions , but with distinct molecular mechanisms . These findings suggest that similar autoinhibitory mechanisms abide across diverse species for FIIND-containing proteins , indicating an evolutionarily conserved strategy to regulate inflammasome signaling . Indeed , DPP9 binds only to full-length hNLRP1 but not its NTs or CTs ; mutations at the cleavage sites of hNLRP1 eliminate their interactions with DPP9 . The UPA subdomain in the CTs mediates interactions with Linker1 ( hNLRP1NT ) , Linker3 ( mNLRP1bNT ) , or ZU5 ( rNLRP1NT and CARD8NT ) , involving in the inflammasome assembly through self-oligomerization . Specifically , hNLRP1NT employs its Linker1 region ( between PYD and NACHT domains ) to bind to hNLRP1CT , whereas mNLRP1bNT utilizes Linker3 ( between LRR and FIIND ) to interact with mNLRP1bCT . Future studies examining the interplay between metabolic states and inflammasome activation will be essential for understanding how these pathways converge in health and disease . The formation of distinct autoinhibitory complexes involving FIIND-containing proteins , such as NLRP1 and CARD8 , represents a highly regulated mechanism in controlling inflammasome activation . Only the allele1 possesses the NLRP1bNT-NLRP1CT complex , attributed to a 61-amino-acid insertion in Linker3 , precisely at the binding site for mNLRP1bCT . Although NLRP1 homologs exhibit low sequence identity in the N-terminus between humans and rodents , they all can form NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes . Consequently , the deletion of Linker1 from hNLRP1 or Linker3 from mNLRP1b not only abolishes NT-CT interaction but also results in spontaneous inflammasome activation . Further investigation into the structure-function relationships within these complexes will enhance the understanding of their biological significance and therapeutic potential . This could help explain why mNLRP1b from C57BL/6J mice

[ABSTRACT] In various growing tissues , cell competition based mechanisms facilitate detection and elimination of these compromised , often referred to as 'loser ' , cells by the healthier neighbors . Our results suggest that increased levels of Rer1 provide cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating the proteotoxic stress and thereby supporting Myc-driven overgrowth . Here , we reveal the function of an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi localized protein Rer1 in the regulation of protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium . In summary , these observations demonstrate that Rer1 acts as a novel regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila and reveal its role in competitive cell survival . Our results show that loss of Rer1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α . Interestingly , we find that Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression that causes overgrowth , albeit under high proteotoxic stress . Defects in protein homeostasis can induce proteotoxic stress , affecting cellular fitness and , consequently , overall tissue health . Clonal analysis showed that rer1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition . The precise connection between proteotoxic stress and competitive cell survival remains largely elusive .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This is in line with recent studies that have implicated mutations in genes , for example , RNA Helicase Hel25E , E3 ubiquitin ligase Mahjong and Rp mutations , in causing proteotoxic stress and subsequent elimination of mutant cells via cell competition . These results suggest that higher levels of Rer1 allowed cells to maintain the increased demand for proteostasis upon Myc-overexpression and thereby mitigating the proteotoxic stress and supporting the overgrowth ( Fig 9E-9G ) . Moreover , studies in yeast , worms and mouse cerebral cortex have shown that absence of Rer1 induces ER stress and activates the UPR pathways , suggesting a well-conserved function of Rer1 across species . Consistent with this , we found that either PERK depletion or dephosphorylation of p-eIF2α by the expression of GADD34 improved the fitness of rer1 mutant cells , indicating that these cells p-eIF2α played a maladaptive role . In any case , aligned with other studies , our work shows that proteotoxic stress , even without a reduction in protein translation , is sufficient to drive elimination of the loser rer1-/-cells . In contrast , blocking p-eIF2α by PERK depletion was shown to suppress the competitive elimination of wollknaeuel ( wol ) mutant clones ( wol is involved in the glycosylation of proteins in the ER ) , Hel25E mutant clones and RpL14+/- cells . In contrast , RpS3+/-mutants show reduced translation attributed to the transcription factor Xrp1 , that is both activated by stress and capable of promoting phosphorylation of eIF2α . We show that Rer1 is localized to the ER and cis-Golgi compartments and loss of Rer1 activates PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α , indicating the onset of proteotoxic stress in the ER . While the reduction in translation is probably not sufficient to induce cell competition , it may pose a disadvantage to the RpS3+/-cells when competing with the rer1-/-cells . We find that Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression and loss of Rer1 further amplifies the proteotoxic stress and protein aggregation in Myc-overexpressing cells . Second , different downstream pathways may be activated by stress originating in the cytoplasm of RpS3+/-cells as compared to stress in the ER of Rer1-deficient cells . Thus , further studies on the effect of Rer1 in Myc-induced overgrowth will be helpful in developing Rer1 as a potential therapeutic target in Myc-driven cancers . However , whether or not the activation of UPR can provide cytoprotective support to the cell appears to depend on the initial cause of proteotoxic stress . The increase in p-eIF2α was shown to play a cytoprotective role which is also required for the growth of Myc-expressing tumors in mice . Importantly , our data shows that the growth of Myc-overexpressing cells was suppressed in rer1+/-background , where cells exhibited higher levels of p-eIF2α . First , RpS3+/-cells , that are also rer1+/- , may experience higher stress levels than rer1-/-cells , potentially rescuing later from their loser fate . Myc-overexpression leads to PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α and the induction of autophagy , which is required for the Myc-driven overgrowth . For instance , in RpS mutants , p-eIF2α was shown to be cytoprotective , although not sufficiently to rescue their loser fate . Our results show that proteotoxic stress induced by Rer1 deficiency creates loser cells that are eliminated via cell competition . Interestingly , our results show that despite both rer1-/-and RpS3+/-cells exhibiting increased p-eIF2α , rer1 mutant cells outperform RpS3+/-cells when juxtaposed . This activation of UPR is believed to be an adaptive response to increased gene expression in Myc-overexpressing cells . This was evident in our analysis of Rer1 in the regulation of proteostasis in Myc overexpressing cells and Myc-driven overgrowth . In this study , we present compelling evidence supporting the role of Rer1 as a regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila . Our data shows that , despite having higher p-eIF2α , rer1-/-cells do not show reduction in translation . Interestingly

[ABSTRACT] Most of the 3 , 188 unique amino acid changes that can result from non-synonymous single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) of CHEK2 , however , have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHEK2-enocded protein ( CHK2 ) . Here we tested all but two of the 4 , 887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame for their ability to complement RAD53 mutants using a high throughput technique of deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) . Combined , this approach can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance that are found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes . The results correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases . This approach has been used to provide functional information on over 100 CHEK2 SNVs and the results align with functional assays in human cells and known pathogenicity . One successful approach to testing the function of variants has been to test for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2 , RAD53 . Loss of function mutations in the checkpoint kinase gene CHEK2 are associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers . Among the non-synonymous changes , 770 were damaging to protein function while 2 , 417 were tolerated .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] However , residues 515-523 contain a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) that is required for nuclear localization in human cells , and this was confirmed by the ENIGMA study showing that truncations at position 519 ( p. R519X ) or 523 ( p. R523fsX ) , or NLS missense variants p. Arg521Gln and p. Arg521Trp , did not localize to the nucleus in human cells . Given the lack of requirement for the C-terminal 43 amino acids for function in our yeast assay , it is puzzling that 25 of the 249 missense variants in that region were found to be damaging , well beyond the expected false positive rate in our assay . The data also provide additional supporting evidence for the 58 variants that have a ClinVar clinical classification as `` conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity '' , and for 443 missense variants that have been tested in at least one other functional assay . For example , our assay measured the ability of CHK2 variants to promote growth in the absence of Rad53 and DNA damaging agents , while other assays in yeast measured the ability of CHK2 variants to overcome DNA damage in a strain that does not require Rad53 or CHK2 for growth . For some variants , the explanation lies in how different studies report variants and whether the classification systems are based on two ( tolerated or damaging ) or three ( including intermediate ) functional classes . In contrast , four other functional assays all found this variant to be intermediate ( meaning somewhat damaging ) , while the VEP algorithms REVEL , HELIX , and AlphaMissense gave this SNV a score of 0 . For example , the 140 variants that either of their functional assays classified as damaging , even if the two assays were discordant , showed a combined increased risk for breast cancer ( OR 2 . A problem that has emerged in using computational or experimental data to determine variant function is that the various assays or prediction methods do not always agree on the classification . Thus , our screen may miss damaging variants in positions in CHK2 that are not required for rad53 growth complementation , but instead may be required for activity in response to DNA damaging agents . The value of a second , confirming assay is further supported by an analysis of ENIGMA data and two functional assays ( KAP1 phosphorylation and CHK2 phosphorylation ) carried out by Stolarova et al . Applying functional data , therefore , can contribute as evidence to the clinical classification system put forth by the ACMG , even for rare variants that have no segregation data . Such an approach is supported by the finding that concordant data from multiple assays has significantly more overlap with independent VEP predictions than data from a single assay . Interestingly , while our screen was incapable of discriminating damaging from intermediate function , a test of the I448S individual clone did show intermediate levels of rad53 growth complementation ( Fig 1 ) . I448S and I157T may be examples of variants that have a truly intermediate effect on function , which different assays interpret differently based on their different sensitivities and classification systems . The fact that several known loss-of-function CHK2 variants are associated with increased cancer risk leads to the expectation that any CHK2 loss-of function variant would also contribute to cancer risk . Some ORF variants may impact transcript splicing , protein binding sites , thermostability , or subcellular localization differently in yeast cells compared to mammalian cells and in situ . It is also possible that differences may arise for variants that affect CHK2 activity toward one subset of its targets and not another . The screen evaluated the functional impact of 4 , 885

[ABSTRACT] When the transcription of tenA was de-repressed by a spontaneous AT di-nucleotide insertion/deletion in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon , TenA bound to the ribosome maturation factor RimM , and thereby reduced the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX ( known for the activation of natural transformation-associated genes ) . Because spontaneous variations frequently occur during bacterial growth in the number of the AT di-nucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon , this locus acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity . SpxA1 and TenA were found to constitute a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae , primarily based on the observation that overexpressing toxin TenA led to growth arrest in E. coli and enhanced autolysis in S. pneumoniae , and the antitoxin SpxA1 repressed the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon . As manifested by phase switch between opaque and transparent colonies , different genome methylation patterns or epigenomes confer pathogenesis-associated traits , but it is unknown how the pathogen controls the hsdS inversion orientations . Here , we report our finding of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin ( TA ) system that regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions , and thereby bacterial epigenome and associated traits ( e. g. , colony opacity ) by targeting pneumococcal protein synthesis . Human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct intra-populations by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant ( cod ) locus . Attenuation of ComX expression in turn enhanced the transcription of the invertase gene psrA , which favored the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus . Phenotypically , moderate expression of TenA dramatically reshaped pneumococcal epigenome and colony opacity .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While this type of repeat sequence variations is explained by the slipped strand mispairing during DNA replication , recent single-cell RNA sequencing in Klebsiella pneumoniae has revealed that spontaneous expression of certain transposases is responsible for insertion or deletion of repeat sequences in the genome and leads to intra-population heterogeneity in gene expression and phenotype . Since ComX and ComW functionally cooperate to activate the expression of the late competence genes by interacting with RNA polymerase and the conserved `` com box '' sequence , it is possible that the two competence-associated proteins also work together to regulate hsdS inversions by repressing the transcription of psrA . When the operon is controlled by the low-transcription AT variants , SpxA1 neutralizes the toxic effect of TenA by forming a protein complex under the physiological conditions , which would enhance the synthesis of ComX and other hsdS-associated proteins , and the formation of the hsdSA1 allelic configuration and the corresponding methylome . Spx , the SpxA1 homolog in B. subtilis , represses the transcription of many stress response-associated genes by interacting with the α subunit of RNA polymerase and the promoter sequences under physiological conditions [ 47-50 ] , but it is selectively degraded by ATP-dependent protease ClpXP under stress conditions . The TenA-driven allelic loss of hsdSA1 was repeatedly verified under various tenA-overexpressed settings , such as ectopic expression of tenA under the control of spxA1 or hu promoter in the bgaA locus , deletion of spxA1 , and sequence changes in the AT-rich region . Phenotypically , the number of AT repeats upstream of the spxA1 promoter broadly defines the cellular metabolism and structure of S. pneumoniae as manifested by variations in the amount of capsular polysaccharide , teichoic acid , fatty acids and proteins , and in the cellular behavior ( e. g. , autolysis and colony opacity ) . Since RimM is crucial for the maturation of the small ribosomal subunit , TenA binding interaction with RimM may interfere with ribosomal maturation and thereby protein synthesis , which leads to a decrease in the cellular abundance of ComX and other proteins that are associated with hsdS inversions . Although ComX is induced by the two-component system ComDE in the competence state , our previous work has shown that deleting comE in S. pneumoniae does not affect pneumococcal methylome or colony phase . While the mechanistic link between genome methylation pattern and colony phase remains to be defined , it is certain that the methylome determined by individual HsdSA shapes pneumococcal colony opacity via complex processes . The AT-rich sequence with certain lengths ( e. g. , 10 and 18 bp ) drives relatively lower level of tenA transcription and higher levels of hsdSA1-carrying bacteria , whereas the sequences with other lengths ( e. g. , 22 and 38 bp ) yield the opposite outcomes . Since the two-hybrid test did not detect direct binding interaction between the two proteins , it appears that TenA and ComX cooperate in regulating hsdS inversions without direct binding to each other by an unknown mechanism . When the AT-rich region takes on the high-transcription sequences , the toxic activity of TenA is unleashed by binding to RimM ( and/or other target ) and inhibiting protein synthesis . A large body of literature has documented significant differences between the opaque and transparent colony phases in the amount of capsular polysaccharide , cell wall polysaccharide , multiple proteins [ 57-59 ] and fatty acids . At the epigenetic level , the pneumococcal strain with the hu promoter-driven tenA completely lost the 6-mA methylation of the DNA motif recognized by the HsdSA1-specific DNA methyltransferase , with

[ABSTRACT] Contrastive principal component analysis ( cPCA ) has been proposed to address this problem , but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions , with no way of knowing which is correct . High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences , and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition . As a fast , robust , and easy-to-use comparison method , gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena . Finally , we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data , revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data . We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios . Moreover , cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently , making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically . Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA ( gcPCA ) , a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems . However , traditional dimensionality reduction techniques can not accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset . We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] One limitation of this study is that we did not establish rigorous criteria for what constitutes `` noisy and finitely-sampled '' data likely to benefit from penalizing high-variance dimensions ( Fig 1 ) , but almost all real-world biological datasets likely qualify to some degree . The biological sciences are currently undergoing an explosion of technologies that produce high-dimensional datasets , including novel forms of microscopy and neuroimaging , high-speed video tracking , Neuropixels recordings , -omics approaches with single-cell resolution , and many others . In most cases using the constraint makes little difference to the end results ( S3A-S3D Fig ) , but the difference will be greater in datasets where some dimensions exhibit much more variance than others , increasing the amount of normalization required . There may also be situations in which cPCA 's α could be a feature , rather than a bug , if the investigator has prior knowledge that the patterns of interest will lie in high- or low-variance dimensions . The key advantage of this approach is not merely that it is computationally cheaper than scanning a range of α 's ; it is that in most real-world cases there is no way to know whether a given choice of α yields a correct solution . In such cases , it would be relatively straightforward to extend gcPCA by adding a parameter that accomplishes a similar result by adjusting the eigenspectrum of the denominator matrix in the objective function , e. g. ( CA+CB ) . There are also other extensions that could be added , such as contrasting more than two conditions or incorporating nonlinearity , which can be relevant to specific data problems . Here we present gcPCA , a method that achieves this by examining the covariance structure of the datasets to find dimensions that exhibit the largest relative changes in variance between conditions . The second caveat is that the normalization factor introduces the possibility of numerical instability if the denominator matrix is rank-deficient , meaning it has dimensions with zero ( or near-zero ) variance that create division by zero . Despite the simplicity of this approach , it reveals interesting phenomena in high-dimensional biological data such as hippocampal replay ( Fig 3 ) or transcriptomic heterogeneity in disease states ( Fig 4 ) . Previous work has focused on developing and improving methods to find appropriate choices for α , but with gcPCA we chose instead to eliminate the α hyperparameter entirely . We thus anticipate that the open-source gcPCA toolbox will provide a valuable resource facilitating a broad range of biological investigations that require contrasting two experimental conditions . In addition to the analyses of electrophysiological recordings or single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrated here , gcPCA could be applied to any of these experimental modalities . In contrast , gcPCA would likely find an age/education-level dimension because those features exhibit more variability across members of the general public than across members of a university team . gcPCA has two main caveats : first , unlike ordinary PCs or cPCs , gcPCs are not orthogonal in the original feature space , but rather in the normalized feature space . LDA and PLS find patterns optimally distinguishing two datasets , but gcPCA finds patterns that exhibit more within-dataset variability in one dataset than another ( S1A Fig ) . As a fictitious example , LDA might find a height dimension distinguishing a university basketball team from the general public because the average basketball player is taller than the average person . We wish to address a common point of confusion by reiterating how gcPCA differs from LDA or Partial Least Squares ( PLS ) regression . Here we showed that the function of α is to compensate for bias toward high-variance dimensions in noisy ,

[ABSTRACT] Moreover , the BL-2 network was also suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells lines with aberrant BCR signaling ( HBL-1 , OCI-LY3 ) , indicating that BCR aberration does not cause a major downstream rewiring . The relevance of the crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites . While proximal BCR signaling is well studied , little is known about the crosstalk of downstream effector pathways , and a comprehensive quantitative network analysis of BCR signaling is missing . Here , we semi-quantitatively modelled BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data of BL-2 and BL-41 cells . The models unveiled feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network , including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK . B cell receptor ( BCR ) signaling is required for the survival and maturation of B cells and is deregulated in B cell lymphomas . Compared to the starting network , the trained network for BL-2 cells was better transferable to BL-41 cells .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] In conclusion , we could demonstrate that the more generic network trained from BL-2 and BL-41 cell lines had better transfer capacity to DLBCL cell lines HBL-1 and OCILY3 than the literature network indicating that a model trained on BCR-activated B-cells is informative to be transferred to BCR-driven cancer models . Thus , the well-known RAF- > MEK- > ERK-|RAF regulatory loop also exists in BLs and DLBCLs , whereas the negative impact of BCR mediated p38 activation onto this loop is a newly discovered crosstalk found in three BL cell lines BL-2 , BL-41 and CA-46 and one DLBCL cell line HBL-1 . Since in our data instead of an attenuation we observe an upregulation of MEK phosphorylation in cells that show the p38 crosstalk when treated with p38 inhibitor ( Figs 2F , 3A and 5A ) , we postulate that the crosstalk must act on or upstream of MEK . As RAF activity is neither measured nor perturbed , the model coefficients of the p38 crosstalk are only identifiable as combinations with the RAF- > MEK link ( S1 and S2 Tables ) which means a direct crosstalk from p38 to MEK would result in the same fit . In our study , as all cell line models retained a strong negative feedback from ERK to RAF ( Fig 6 ) -which causes an hyperactivation of MEK , when ERK activity is switched off by e. g. , a MEK inhibitor -we would expect a downregulation of MEK activity when ERK is hyperactivated alone . Importantly , our conserved BCR network model can be applied to the situation in antigen-driven BCR activation ( BL-2/BL-41 ) and the situation , were the BCR pathway is antigen independently activated , driven by gain-of-function mutations in specific signaling molecules of the BCR pathway ( HBL-1/OCI-LY3 ) . Importantly , also the qualitative wiring of the established core BCR network is conserved across all or at least the majority of cell lines and only few cell type- and cell line-specific characteristics could be detected . In addition , a positive link between mTOR and JNK and a positive feedback downstream of AKT to upstream of PI3K/Btk is proposed in our consensus model , which notably are kept also in both DLBCL cell line models . A recent study that compared primary Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and non-malignant B Cell signaling by modeling a smaller network ( 5 nodes ) using Bayesian inference learning underscores our finding by determining only a modest topology difference between the malignant and non-malignant network . However , as we determined that those signaling motifs are conserved across different B cell lymphoma types it might be possible that insights of this study apply also to other B cell lymphomas . For example , a recent study described an essential dependency to MAPK activity in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia progression suggesting that insights from this study could be valuable for treatment decisions in CLL . We explored how a more quantitative understanding of signaling can be used to describe a conserved B cell receptor regulated signaling network , which can be used as a starting point to quantify cell-specific , individual networks . A previous study on Hela cells determined that the crosstalk is conferred by direct binding of p38 to ERK , as it demonstrated direct binding and no change in MEK phosphorylation . We propose that the identified negative crosstalk from BCR mediated activation of p38 to the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway might dampen an excessive RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade . While the mechanism behind the p38 -MEK/ERK crosstalk remains enigmatic , it is clear that it is neither mediated by the ERK feedback sites nor the tested activation sites of RAF1 . RAF is a complex kinase family with more activity regulating phosphosites than we could observe with our analysis and at least another important isoform BRAF . In here we can recapitulate this finding on a larger core network ( 16 nodes

[ABSTRACT] Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling , we provide evidence that two mechanisms could underpin this process : 1 ) DLL4 rather than JAG1 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation ; 2 ) JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex . Operationally , receptor activity is regulated by two principal , counterposed mechanisms : intercellular Notch transactivation triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells ; intracellular cis inhibition mediated by ligands binding to receptors expressed in the same cell . Moreover , different Notch receptor/ligand combinations are known to elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses , and together , these phenomena determine the strength , the duration and the specificity of Notch receptor signalling . To date , it has been assumed that these processes involve discrete ligand homomers and not heteromeric complexes composed of more than one ligand species . We propose a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells , which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis . In this study , we explore the molecular basis of the opposing actions of the Notch ligands , DLL4 and JAG1 , which control angiogenic sprouting . The ubiquitous Notch receptor signalling network is essential for tissue growth and maintenance .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] It is compelling that there are parallels between this ( presumably relatively ancient ) mechanism and a remarkable recent evolutionary innovation which has been proposed to explain , at molecular resolution , the dramatic expansion in size of the cortical region of the human brain , whereby small ligand-like Notch2 receptor paralogues enable Notch receptor activation by directly binding to , and potentially blocking , DLL1-dependent receptor cis inhibition . Currently , it is not fully understood how such a defined pattern of Notch activity is generated and sustained , and a possible contributing factor could be that the relative production rates of Serrate and Delta in the two cell types establishes signalling thresholds , comparable to those observed in adjacent endothelial tip and stalk cells , which enables a heteromeric ligand complex to spatially and temporally restrict Notch receptor activation . Given the wide range of distinct physiological phenomena which are governed by this relatively simple receptor-ligand network ( see [ 1-7 ] ) , multiple additional regulatory mechanisms must operate to enable the broad repertoire of possible responses , including biomechanical forces , post-translational modifications of both receptors and ligands , asymmetric cell divisions and processes which promote and control action-at-a-distance Notch signalling activities . In the context of our new model , by considering these facets of Notch signalling and endothelial sprouting , we could get not only deeper insights into normal developmental sprouting angiogenesis but also into other physiological processes , such as wound healing , and the pathological angiogenesis unique to solid tumours , and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases . In this study , we have used simple experimental approaches coupled to mathematical modelling to address this question , specifically by considering how the JAG1 and DLL4 ligands differentially control Notch1 receptor activation , a question of fundamental relevance in light of the well-established evidence for the opposing effects of DLL4 and JAG1 , which together control angiogenic sprouting . Additional mechanisms could also contribute to the overall regulation of the Notch network including signalling initiated by processing of the ligand intracellular domains , and a possible role for Notch receptor oligomerization/dimerization , which would add an additional layer of complexity to the system , though the precise molecular details of this remain elusive . It should be stated that we can not rule out that ligand monomers and dimers might dynamically associate and dissociate during Notch signalling , but most mathematical models , including the model we proposed here , do not take into account the possible reversibility of these interactions . Significant advances in our understanding of Notch signalling have emerged , and continue to emerge , through use of powerful mathematical approaches coupled to in silico modelling of the biological consequences of the molecular and cellular processes involved in this pathway [ 14-16 , 25-29 , 39-43 ] . Since the discovery of the Notch receptor in the second decade of the last century , both pioneering work in in vivo model systems , as well as cell and biochemical analyses , have provided a detailed , albeit incomplete , picture of its essential roles in animal development and the basic molecular underpinnings of its function . undertook a different approach to model the asymmetric effects of DLL4 and JAG1 on endothelial cell fate in which the opposing effects of DLL4 expression and JAG1 expression on Notch signalling suggest that high production levels of DLL4 establishes the tip-stalk phenotype in interacting cells while high production rates of JAG1 destabilizes the tip and stalk cell fates and can give rise to a hybrid tip/stalk phenotype . By integrating DLL4 and JAG1 dynamics , and DLL4/JAG1 dimerization , into our previous theoretical understanding of Notch signalling , a new mathematical model for tip endothelial cell selection in angiogenesis is proposed which successfully recapitulates the biological observations that JAG1 and DLL4 play distinct roles

[ABSTRACT] We first introduce a novel procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different to the one where it was discovered , which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual . We show the value of this procedure by summarising gene expression data from patients with immune-mediated diseases using relevant gene signatures , and clustering these patients using DPMUnc . Firstly , we demonstrate that when data has associated uncertainty , this uncertainty should be used to inform clustering and we present a method which does this , DPMUnc . We present Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty ( DPMUnc ) , an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm which makes use of the uncertainty associated with data points . We cluster immune-mediated diseases ( IMD ) using GWAS summary statistics , which have uncertainty linked with the sample size of the study . Many types of data have associated uncertainty or measurement error , but this is rarely used to inform the clustering . We additionally consider how DPMUnc can be used to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarised using gene signatures . Clustering is widely used in bioinformatics and many other fields , with applications from exploratory analysis to prediction . Secondly , we present a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were originally defined . We find association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc , with clustering structure replicated across the datasets . DPMUnc separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis . We summarise three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD , using three relevant gene signatures . We show that DPMUnc out-performs existing methods on simulated data . The significance of this work is two-fold .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] To then use them on a new dataset with more complex structure , such as a dataset with patients with a mix of immune-mediated diseases , typically requires some form of dimension reduction such as WGCNA or PCA used on the new dataset , either using just those genes from the signature or using all genes with the hope that one WGCNA module or variable in PCA will coincide with the signature . On a range of simulated datasets , DPMUnc out-performed existing methods and the posterior similarity values were shown to be relatively well calibrated , so that if two points have posterior similarity of p , this roughly translates to probability p that they are in the same cluster in the true clustering . Our proposed method of summarising a gene expression across a signature extends the possible uses of signatures , and since the signature may be weaker on a dataset with more complex structure , it may be crucial to take the variability of the signature into account , which DPMUnc allows . We illustrated with simulated data how the cluster mean inferred by DPMUnc is closer to the points that have lower uncertainty , whereas methods like mclust and k-means place the cluster mean close to the empirical mean of all the points , and also how DPMUnc shifts the latent data points towards the inferred cluster mean , which results in a smaller cluster variance . It also suggests further uses for clustering with uncertainty , such as clustering individuals using sets of polygenic risk scores , where the uncertainty in the PRS coefficients could be exploited rather than ignored . In the real data examples shown here , we assume there is limited dependence between the genetic features as these were derived using PCA and between the transcriptomic features because there is no overlap of genes between the different signatures . In the case of the Ferreira dataset , this led to a clearer separation of the two disease and control groups , emphasizing the potential utility of considering multiple signatures , which provide multiple views of the same data . In a more complicated dataset this could have knock-on consequences , perhaps excluding more distant points from joining the cluster , or splitting one cluster into two . Gene signatures may be defined on one dataset with ideal experimental conditions , such as a timecourse study of the effect of interferon-β . We note that because DPMUnc assumes independence between features , its use is likely to be restricted to data that is relatively low dimensional . In two of the nine examples we examined , ignoring uncertainty led to clusterings which did not associate with disease status . Our clustering of diseases by the engineered GWAS features recapitulated known divisions and relationships in the immune-mediated diseases . In particular , it allows us to cluster patients simultaneously according to multiple signatures . Taking uncertainty into account can alter clustering solutions .

[ABSTRACT] By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations , we show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features , whereas others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards the other features . This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser , more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision . Whereas humans base their judgements of category membership to a large extent on shape , deep networks rely much more strongly on other features such as color and texture . We show that the bias can be explained by the interactions between the weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent . We design simple , artificial image datasets in which shape , color , and texture features can be used to predict the image class . One crucial problem is that they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision . Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful as models of the primate visual system . While this problem has been widely documented , the underlying reasons remain unclear .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Furthermore , by using the neural tangent kernel as an analytical tool we identified a mechanism by which the learning dynamics of mini-batch gradient descent can bias a network towards color and texture : there are groups of images for which gradients that increase the sensitivity to these features are aligned , whereas there are no such image groups for shape features . Competition is an especially promising candidate for incorporation into deep networks for several reasons : its cortical equivalent-normalization-is well documented and pervasive and there are theories about the computational role it could play in vision by sparsifying and whitening representations . While each of these problems can be solved , for example by designing custom architectures or training on augmented datasets , understanding how these differences to human vision arise from the learning dynamics of deep networks may point the way to unified solutions . This explanation illustrates why training on stylized images , using appearance-changing image augmentation , and avoiding very small random crops can help increase the shape bias of deep networks , but still fails to make them sensitive to global shape features . The question is whether there is a qualitative difference between how transformers process natural images and our artificial stimuli ( interpretation 1 ) , or whether transformers have an underlying deficiency preventing them from learning certain shape features , but natural images contain enough other features to mask this problem . If networks can first store training examples in an associative memory and later learn to extract common patterns from them , this may reduce the averaging effect of gradient-descent learning and help them discover rarer , more complex features like shape . In this sense , it may be the simplicity of our shape-only images that makes them hard to learn for transformers : there are very few features to be grouped and the features are exactly the same in both classes , differing only minutely in their spatial arrangement . This may explain why vision transformers show a higher shape bias : they are more robust against changes in texture by image style transfer , since they may still be able to find matching patches from the original object . The multi-shape dataset included both local shape features ( such as different angles ) and global features ( aspect ratio ) and we tested whether there were differences in which features the networks could learn ( see Fig C in S1 Appendix ) . We hypothesise that local shape features ( for example , a specific contour on an object outline ) occur more frequently and are more straightforwardly aligned with image classes than global shape features ( for example , a specific arrangement of several object parts ) , biasing the network to local rather than global features . As we have argued above , our results in experiments 3 and 4 demonstrate that the color- and texture-bias arises from the dynamics of gradient descent learning , specifically from the way that gradients for color and texture features align with image classes . However , the simplicity of our stimuli carries a risk : there could be a qualitative difference between how networks learn simple features that are highly predictive of the target class and how networks learn more complex , ambiguous features in natural images . While we have only examined the bias for shape , color and texture , there are several other differences between deep networks and human vision , such as the susceptibility for adversarial attacks and robustness to image degradation . In contrast , both ViT-B-16 and Swin-T were able to learn the shape-only classification tasks after pre-training them on ImageNet and fine-tuning the last layer ( see Fig E in S1 Appendix ) . Second , we analyzed the structure of these shape- , color- , and texture-selective reference NTKs and showed that the color- and texture-selective NTKs contained clusters
[METHODS] ",,943,96,None,"Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful as models of the primate visual system . However , they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision . We design simple , artificial image datasets in which shape , color , and texture features can be used to predict the image class . By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations , we show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features , whereas others are able to use shapes in principle but are biased towards the other features . This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser , more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their ability to describe human vision , but the underlying reasons remain unclear ."

[ABSTRACT] HSCs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and that interact with ( TGFβ1 ) molecules which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen , the main component of the ECM . By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis , we confirmed this accumulation , identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression . Furthermore , we demonstrated the model 's sensitivity to ( TGFβ1 ) parameters , suggesting its adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions for which levels of ( TGFβ1 ) production associated with the inflammatory response differ . Few models of hepatic fibrosis have been proposed , and none of them include the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing analyses . Overall , our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis . Hepatic stellate cells ( HSC ) are the source of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis , a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases . While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps , reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs ( iHSCs ) are required to sustain fibrosis . Using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis , we validated the predicted ECM dynamics . Moreover , our model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues . We used the Kappa graph rewriting language , for which we used tokens and counters to overcome temporal explosion . Here , we developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion . Simulation studies revealed the critical role of the HSC inactivation process during fibrosis progression and reversion . Understanding the dynamics of HSCs will provide insights needed to develop new therapeutic approaches . Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] First we have demonstrated the applicability of the Kappa language to multi-scale approaches by using : tokens , to represent the quantities of molecules in a compact way , and counters to abstract the dynamics of cell-specific phenotypes . These predictions have been validated either experimentally in a mouse model of CCl4-induced fibrosis , or using RNA sequencing data from patients with fibrosis . Thus , our model provides biological predictions for the reactivation loop , the dynamics of inactivated cells and their accumulation during fibrosis progression . Second , we developed the first model of HSC dynamics during liver fibrosis and reversion . The present study provides two major findings .

[ABSTRACT] Whereas the proposed meta-analysis can uniquely evaluate and account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to , for example , varying genomic profiling platforms , our extensive simulations showed that the developed method was more computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to analysis of the pooled individual-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity . Leveraging the recent established asymptotic standard error of the R-squared ( R2 ) -based mediation effect estimation for high-dimensional omics mediators , we have developed a novel meta-analysis framework requiring only summary statistics and allowing inter-study heterogeneity . Large-scale genomic consortia , such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) program , comprise multiple cohorts with diverse technologies to elucidate the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits and diseases . We applied the developed method to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol . Meta-analysis is used to aggregate the effects of interest across multiple studies , while its methodology is largely underexplored in mediation analysis , particularly in estimating the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators . The proposed method is available in R package MetaR2M on GitHub .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] In the TOPMed program , as a proof of concept we applied our proposed new meta-analysis framework across various FHS and MESA cohorts to assess the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic BP and sex-related variation in HDL-C. Our findings closely align with results derived from the original individual-level data with much less computational cost , highlighting the efficiency of our method in handling the computational burden caused by large-scale studies . Furthermore , in the more realistic scenario where the assumption of a common effect size across all studies no longer holds , the random-effects model maintains an acceptable coverage probability when the number of studies is relatively large , for example , larger than 10 , which holds for most large-scale genomic consortia , such as the TOPMed program with over 85 studies and The Global Lipids Genetics Consortium with over 200 studies . On the other hand , as shown in our real data applications ( Fig 3 ) , the total mediation effects captured by the R M e d 2 measure were more consistent across cohorts despite different sets of genes were selected in each cohort , highlighting the consistent biological mechanisms revealed at the transcriptomic and biological pathway levels , but not necessarily at the individual gene level . Meta-analysis can be an appealing alternative to analysis of the entire dataset at once in terms of computational feasibility and evaluating potential heterogeneity across risk factors for common diseases and genomic profiling technologies , as demonstrated in our application to the FHS and MESA cohorts . On the other hand , unlike correlations/LDs among SNPs which are stable within a population ( e. g. , individuals of European ancestry ) , gene expression is highly variable in response to environmental and endogenous stimuli , leading to the lack of reliable and transferable correlations among genome-wide gene expression from external sources . As shown in Fig B and Fig C in S1 Text , there was zero selected gene ( mediator ) that was common to all 5 cohorts in either age-SBP or sex-HDL application , highlighting the heterogeneity in high-dimensional mediator selection and challenges in single-gene-based meta-analysis of mediation effects ( Table F in S1 Text ) . Second , univariate summary statistics-based heritability estimation ( e. g. , LD score regression ) relies on accurate linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) ( correlation ) information among all SNPs from large external reference panels , such as those based on the 1000 Genomes and the TOPMed WGS data . Based on our simulations , we demonstrate that the relative efficiency and coverage probability achieved using summary statistics are comparable with those obtained from the original individual-level data in a fixed-effects meta-analysis . This is particularly applicable to mediation analysis in large-scale biobanks , such as the UK Biobank of over a half million participants with diverse ethnicity and multi-omics profiling based on different platforms . First , both consider the phenotypic variance that can be explained by a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) or mediators , and , thus , avoid cancelling out of positive and negative individual SNP/mediator effects . This , along with the need for variable selection within each cohort , makes univariate summary statistics-based mediation analysis and its meta-analysis much more challenging than heritability estimation based on GWAS SNPs . In our real data application , we applied variable selection to exclude non-mediators and adjusted for the top PCs of genome-wide gene expression to account for unmeasured confounding effects . First , in the former , only a single model Y ∼ GWAS SNPs is entailed , while , in the latter , three models are needed , Y ∼ X , Y ∼ M , and Y ∼ M + X , where X is the exposure of interest and M are high-dimensional omics data

[ABSTRACT] Here , we propose a novel method ( PDRWH ) , which aims to prioritize the mutated genes of a single patient based on their impact on the abnormal expression of downstream genes across a group of patients who share the co-mutation genes and similar gene expression profiles . Although many computational methods have been developed with this purpose , the majority of existing methods solely provided a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients , ignoring the high heterogeneity of driver events across patients . Cancer development is driven by an accumulation of a small number of driver genetic mutations that confer the selective growth advantage to the cell , while most passenger mutations do not contribute to tumor progression . We also validated one of our predicted novel personalized driver genes on tumor cell proliferation by vitro cell-based assays , the promoting effect of the high expression of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 ( LRP1 ) on tumor cell proliferation . The wide experimental results on 16 cancer datasets from TCGA showed that PDRWH excels in identifying known general driver genes and tumor-specific drivers . The personalized driver profiles could improve tumor stratification , providing new insights into understanding tumor heterogeneity and taking a further step toward personalized treatment . The identification of these driver genes responsible for tumorigenesis is a crucial step in designing effective cancer treatments . In the comparative testing across five cancer types , PDRWH outperformed existing individual-level methods as well as cohort-level methods . Our results also demonstrated that PDRWH could identify both common and rare drivers . It remains challenging to identify the personalized driver genes .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Additionally , our current model primarily focuses on point mutations , including single-nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) and short insertions or deletions ( indels ) , due to their prevalence , ease of detection , and potential as genetic markers for specific phenotypes that promote tumor formation . PDRWH , similar to many unsupervised algorithms , can directly uncover hidden patterns and structures in data without the need for explicit model training or a large number of labeled genes , aiming to provide comprehensive support for the analysis of driver genes . Despite these limitations , PDRWH has demonstrated reliable performance in inferring personalized driver genes , which is promising for discovering potential causal genetic variants that would be obscured by tumor heterogeneity . By grouping patient-specific mutated genes and abnormally expressed genes within the corresponding hyperedge , the hypergraph model allows for a comprehensive representation of association among genes across multiple samples simultaneously , rather than separately . The random walk algorithm on the hypergraph is tailored to generate a quantitative assessment of the influence on the gene interaction network within the target sample and its neighboring samples , facilitating the systematic prioritization of candidate personalized driver genes . We believe our method will complement existing driver identification methods and will help us discover potential personalized drivers , especially those rare drivers that often escape detection by other methods . Therefore , there is a clear need for computation methods to elucidate how these genetic aberrations collaborate to induce transcriptional abnormalities , and ultimately lead to the onset of cancer . However , the impact of other somatic alterations like amplifications , genomic rearrangements , and epigenetic silencing , which are also crucial in tumorigenesis , has not been considered . In this study , we have presented an unsupervised learning method to identify patient-specific driver genes by leveraging genome and transcriptome datasets from a cohort . As a result , it overlooks regulation information that is specific to individual patients , which could potentially lead to false positives in the results . Moreover , PDRWH focuses on prioritizing single genes , while it is well-established that genes often collaborate to drive cancer initiation and progression . Comparisons based on the TCGA have demonstrated the superior performance of PDRWH over other computational methods in identifying the known cancer drivers . Identifying personalized driver genes that lead to particular cancer initiation and progression of individual patients is a crucial part of precision medicine . The novelty of this study lies in the introduction of the concept and methodology of hypergraph random walks to predict personalized driver genes . One limitation of the current model is that it relies on a broad-context molecular network rather than a patient-specific one . Integrating information on all these alterations would improve the identification of driver genes in cancer . In the future , we expect that PDRWH will assist in the development of optimal personalized treatment . The hypergraph model offers substantial benefits in terms of data integration and interpretability .

[ABSTRACT] It is capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG data , allowing for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery . Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic data , our proposal successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models , demonstrating better scalability and superior performance against other parallel solvers . Additionally , we added a scalable uncertainty quantification phase after model calibration , and used it to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems . These results were further enhanced using a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning , with significant gains in terms of both accuracy and computational cost . Overall , this study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy , thereby to inform the clinical decision-making process . The Virtual Epileptic Patient ( VEP ) refers to a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities . The approach utilizes SaCeSS , a cooperative metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation , to yield high-quality solutions without requiring excessive computational time . This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Therefore , several open questions remain for future consideration , including the calibration of stochastic problems given their high computational cost , and enhancing this procedure through a sensitivity analysis to determine the most impactful settings for inclusion or exclusion during fine-tuning . Thus , in order to enhance efficiency when addressing stochastic models , a promising strategy could be to study the integration of SaCeSS with Bayesian optimization methods , known for their proficiency in such challenges , at least for problems of moderate number of parameters . In the comparison of SaCeSS with two other leading parallel solvers ( asynPDE and PS-CMA-ES ) , as showcased in Table 2 , our approach demonstrates a consistent advantage over these competitors across multiple criteria in addressing VEP problems . The accurate parameter estimations in different configurations of the VEP model , as shown in Table 2 and Figs 2 , 3 and 4 highlight the capability of SaCeSS to solve high-dimensional problems within a reasonable computational time , using just 12 processors . In summary , driven by the challenge of estimating parameters in a series of progressively complex whole-brain network models related to epilepsy , this study started with the objective of selecting a resilient and efficient global optimization solver . Nevertheless , SaCeSS also delivers steadfast performance on smaller-scale systems , such as desktop workstations equipped with a moderate quantity of cores and memory , even when operating under stringent time limitations . Moreover , considering the scarcity of parallel global optimization methods , and the complexities entailed in handling estimation problems involving differential equations , this comparative analysis emerges as a significant and informative contribution in itself . We also extended SaCeSS with a mechanism to store and post-process the parameter space sampled in the vicinity of the global solution and , after convergence , use the sampling to perform approximate uncertainty quantification . Overall , these findings collectively highlight the potential of our global optimization approach in contributing to more informed clinical decision-making through fast and accurate parameter estimation in VEP models . This flexibility ensures accessibility for a broad user base , including those with limited experience in high-performance computing , allowing them to fully exploit the advantages offered by our methodology . The original SaCeSS was designed for high-performance computing environments because of its parallel nature and scalability , i. e. adding parallel workers to the search increases the probability of finding a better solution faster . The use of SaCeSS with 12 processors and a time threshold of 3 hours demonstrates the algorithm 's convergence in deterministic problems , even for a large number of regions ( see Fig 6 ) , confirming the method 's scalability . In this particular context , as opposed to sequential algorithms , the settings to be fine-tuned are related to `` social '' features of multi-agent systems , such as communications among different workers . The fine-tuning revealed that four of the hyperparameters are similar to their default values , which were established based on our previous experience with SaCeSS optimizations . Nevertheless , considering a slightly modified cost function for problem 6 ( details given in S1 File ) , SaCeSS was able to obtain better fitness than the ground truth model . Finally , the hyperparameter fine-tuning of SaCeSS using Bayesian optimization ( with the Optuna solver ) has resulted in significant improvements , particularly in the VEP problems with a deterministic cost function . As a second objective , we wanted a solver capable of leveraging parallel computing across various platforms , ranging from personal desktop workstations to supercomputers . Our investigation revealed the robustness and efficiency of the SaCeSS parallel solver in addressing the complex parameter estimation problems associated with VEP models . However , the Optuna results found larger values for two specific settings : the maximum number of evaluations for local solvers and the

Interestingly , the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in lungs of Mtb-infected rabbits did not follow an expected monotonic decline ; the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points . It is well understood that pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung but quantitative estimates of rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of patients or animals such as monkeys or rabbits remain largely unknown . Taken together , our new data and mathematical modeling-based analyses illustrate differences in Mtb dynamics in mice and rabbits confirming a perhaps somewhat obvious observation that `` rabbits are not mice `` . In our in vitro experiments we found that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 strain than in a more commonly used laboratory-adapted Mtb strain H37Rv ( the segregation coefficient being s = 0 . We performed experiments with rabbits infected with a novel , virulent clinical Mtb isolate of the Beijing lineage , HN878 , carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10 . Our model predictions can be tested in future experiments in which HN878-pBP10 dynamics in individual granulomas is followed over time . Given that in rabbits HN878 strain forms well circumscribed granulomas , our results suggest independent bacterial dynamics in subsets of such granulomas . Importantly , a model with one kinetically homogeneous Mtb population could not explain the data including when the model was run stochastically . Tuberculosis ( TB ) , the disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) , remains a major health problem with 10 . 6 million cases of the disease and 1 . 6 million deaths in 2021 . 10 in HN878 vs. s = 0 . 18 in H37Rv ) . [ INTRODUCTION ] [ RESULTS ] [ DISCUSSION ] How the dynamics would proceed at lower doses is uncertain although we made model-driven predictions on how parameters of Mtb replication rate and death may influence the size and composition of Mtb replicating in individual granulomas of rabbits ( or other animal species ) starting with a single plasmid-bearing cell . Simulating Mtb dynamics stochastically assuming one-population model in which individual bacteria become activated at different times after infection did not allow to accurately match experimental data ( S5 Fig ) suggesting that stochastic dynamics of one population model can not explain non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells in rabbit lungs . Here we extend these studies by showing that even when measuring Mtb numbers in the whole lung of rabbits , along with the percent of bacterial cells carrying plasmid pPB10 , we can detect and to a degree quantify heterogeneity in rates of Mtb replication and death in vivo . Of course , it is likely that the number of different sub-populations could be even larger that two or three , e. g. , if individual bacteria seeding different lung tissues have somewhat independent dynamics as has been proposed for Mtb dynamics in non-human primates . Stochastic simulations also suggested that measuring the percent of plasmid-bearing cells in individual granulomas of rabbits should allow to estimate Mtb replication and death rates in the granuloma ( Fig 5 and S8 Fig ) , and thus , should provide quantitative explanation of why different granulomas have dramatically different numbers of viable bacteria . These calculations highlight that second subpopulation contributes most of the bacteria produces during the infection and is associated with less death , explaining how this sub-population drives disease in the animals ( due to a large increase in CFU in some animals , Fig 4A & 4B ) . We showed that a previously suggested model assuming a single , kinetically homogeneous Mtb population is not consistent with these data , and including two and three sub-populations with different replication/death kinetics would allow the model to more accurately fit these data ( Fig 4 and S4 Fig ) . By measuring dynamics of plasmid loss in individual granulomas in rabbit lungs we should be able to determine if granulomas with more rapidly dividing bacteria are related to the location of these granulomas in the lung and/or due to local immune response . Considering that the rabbit model of pulmonary Mtb infection can produce cavitary granulomas in the lungs , correlating Mtb replication kinetics in individual granulomas in control and vaccinated animals can help identify immune components that control Mtb growth , helping with development of the next generation of TB vaccines . There are other methods used to evaluate how quickly Mtb replicate in vivo including CEQ or RS ratio ; however , these methods remain qualitative and do not provide rigorous estimates of Mtb replication rates , particularly in heterogeneous in vivo granulomas . Future studies will need to use different methods ( e. g. , based on replication clock plasmid , RS ratio or CEQ measurements , ) and evaluate whether these different metrics give similar estimates of Mtb replication rates and death in vivo . To gain better insights into how immunity controls Mtb dynamics , our future work will focus on correlating estimated replication",,1024,80,Missing abstract section|Missing discussion section,"Tuberculosis ( TB ) , the disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculoses ( Mtb ) is a major health problem with 10 . 6 million cases of the disease and 1 . 3 million deaths in 2021 .

[ABSTRACT] In this work , we developed a glycan-modeling algorithm , GlycanTreeModeler , that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer , using adaptive kernel density estimates ( KDE ) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) and from quantum mechanics ( QM ) calculations . We employed these tools to design de novo glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition , and experimentally verified shielding . Structures predicted by GlycanTreeModeler agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both de novo modeling and experimental density-guided building . This work will inform glycoprotein model prediction , glycan masking , and further aid computational methods in experimental structure determination and refinement . GlycanTreeModeler was benchmarked on a test set of glycan structures of varying lengths , or `` trees '' . Computational approaches can aid in carbohydrate structure prediction , structure determination , and design . However , experimental structure determination of sugar polymers is notoriously difficult . Carbohydrates and glycoproteins modulate key biological functions .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In fact , even before full optimization and release , the GlycanSampler algorithm ( previously the glycan_relax app ) was used to model glycans on HIV , Hepatitis C , vaccine candidates , and ( with the final optimized version ) SARS-CoV-2 , illustrating the general utility of the algorithm and its potential to inform chemical biology . The tools presented here can sample and build multiple potential whole glycans at a site through the SimpleGlycosylateMover , but core Rosetta methods that also consider species and cell-type dependent glycan chemistries during the GlycanTreeModeler or end-to-end deep learning methods would be a welcome addition to the methods presented here . Knowledge of the range of glycoforms and occupancy occurring at a glycosylation site can be obtained through mass-spectroscopy techniques , but due to chemical and structural heterogeneity at any single glycan site , modelers will typically need to build models for multiple different glycoforms at a single site , especially for complex glycans . In addition , we demonstrated the usability of these methods through glycan masking the trimeric subunit of a two-component self-assembling protein nanoparticle that is used as a scaffold to multi-valency display viral glycoprotein antigens . However , even with this consideration , many of the benchmark glycans that were modeled accurately to their crystal structures are not hindered by monomer or crystal contacts , but have few interactions to protein residues in their glycan root . However , while the results are encouraging , a truly automated solution for glycoprotein modeling must also sample glycan chemistries , branching , and kinematics simultaneously in order to build potential glycan residues into the density of unknown glycans . By combining the tools through RosettaScripts , it becomes possible to computationally design glycan sequons at ideal positions on a protein , and then build and model multiple potential glycans at a variety of sites in a symmetric manner . In addition , the modular nature of the components allows them to be further developed for specific engineering tasks such as immunogenicity reduction or the optimization of developability characteristics such as half-life , solubility , and aggregation potential . As core protocols in Rosetta continue to be optimized , and as deep learning becomes a more integral aspect of modeling and design , SimpleMetrics should allow the robust analysis of new protocols , results , and Rosetta benchmarks , as it has for this work . In order to improve the algorithm further , the Rosetta energy function will need to be optimized to improve glycan-protein interactions , specifically in terms of hydrogen bonds , solvation , and the introduction of energy terms that better represent aromatic CH-π interactions . Although the algorithm is capable of accurate de novo modeling of many glycans ( especially at their base ) and has been used for experimental glycan masking , there is certainly room for improvement . Upon further investigation of the many native glycans in the benchmark set with water-mediated hydrogen bonds , we originally hypothesized that explicit water modeling might help the energy function discriminate near-native models . These results show that the GlycanTreeModeler is able to accurately predict glycan structures de novo , build them into known density , and be used in SugarCoating protein surfaces . While we can generalize that low energy conformations found through the GlycanTreeModeler should be indicative of probable solution conformations , the GlycanTreeModeler was not benchmarked on an experimental ensemble of glycan structures . Most glycans can sample a wide range of conformations in solution , as they are mostly polar , usually exposed to solvent , and have many conformational degrees of freedom . SimpleMetrics have now become a critical tool for general analysis in Rosetta and as a way to export important information for external algorithms , such as the quantum annealer . Finally , the algorithm requires more compute time as the number of glycans to model increases , which can be prohibitive for large , multimeric glycoproteins such as HIV .

PoFbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator , recognizing and activating PoAce1 , allowing the latter to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects ( activating or repressing ) under different signals . A small portion of PoFbx23 associates with Skp1 to form PoFbx23-Skp1 heterodimer or assembles with the three invariable core components ( Skp1 , Cul1 , and Rbx1 ) of SCF to form the SCFFbx23 complex . Transcription factor Ace1 ( also known as SltA ) positively correlated with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively correlated with the expression of ( hemi ) cellulase genes . Deleting the Pofbx23 gene does not affect Poace1 gene transcription but results in the remarkable accumulation of all versions of the PoAce1 protein . The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF ( Skp1-Cullin-F-box ) complex directly recognizes the target substrate via interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate . When PoFbx23 is present , PoAce1 exists as a full-length version and several low-molecular-weight degraded versions . Under cellulose signal , transcription levels of ( hemi ) cellulase genes in the Δfbx23 mutant are significantly upregulated . The limited number of identified ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitination field . Protein ubiquitination is usually coupled with proteasomal degradation and is crucial in regulating protein quality . Most of PoFbx23 is present in free form within the nucleus . A ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair , SCFFbx23-Ace1 , is identified in P. oxalicum . F-box protein is the determinant of substrate specificity . PoAce1 has polyubiquitin modification .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Given the direct evidence from our study that PoAce1 is a substrate for PoFbx23 and the results of that A. nidulans AnAce1 was discovered in the 23 proteins which were pulled down as potential interacting proteins with AnFbx23 , it is reasonable to conclude that Fbx23-Ace1 pair is conserved in Penicillium sp . Upon discovering that the ~32-kDa form of PoAce1 was also present in the Ace1-TAP eluate ( Figs 1C , 4A , and 5A , green arrow ) , our initial hypothesis was that SCFFbx23-Ace1 took the proteasome-dependent pathway : PoAce1 was degraded by SCFFbx23-mediated UPS and took the ~32-kDa active form that regulates the transcription of the target genes ; the 32-kDa form would vanish if Pofbx23 gene is deleted . However , PoFbx23 's absence only resulted in a significant increase in PoAce1 protein abundance relative to normal cells ; no discernible difference in PoAce1 protein degradation was observed : every signal of PoAce1 protein , including the full-length ( signal at ~ 100 kDa ) or degraded versions ( signals at low Mw . By integrating the discoveries from this study with the wealth of knowledge from previous research on the Fbx23 protein and the transcription factor SltA/Ace1 in P. oxalicum and other fungi [ 26-31 ] , we propose a model about PoFbx23-Ace1 regulating gene transcription ( Fig 10 ) . Therefore , even though the accumulated degraded versions of PoAce1 in the PoFbx23 deletion strain can support the UPS , the lone presence of ubiquitinated PoAce1 and its degraded versions may not be the active forms of PoAce1 ; PoAce1 must interact with PoFbx23 to become an active form that can bind to target genes . In addition to the dysfunctional PoAce1 as the first explanation , we can not exclude the second explanation-the role of PoFbx23 itself , as well as the role of PoFbx23 with other substrates , because losing a fungal F-box protein can result in a pleiotropic phenotype , especially when the FBP has multiple targets . Some PoFbx23 proteins can also interact with other proteins , such as transcription factors other than PoAce1 ; ( 2 ) a small amount of PoFbx23 combines with PoSkp1 to form the PoFbx23-Skp1 heterodimer and recognizes the PoAce1 ; ( 3 ) a still smaller amount of PoFbx23 assembles with the core SCF scaffolds ( Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1 ) to form the SCFFbx23 complex . It is evident that PoFbx23 recognition and binding to PoAce1 is necessary for PoAce1 to have DNA-binding activity , although we have not been able to determine whether PoAce1 exhibits its active form due to the binding of the PoFbx23-Skp1 heterodimer and/or the SCFFbx2 complex . There are at least 10 known targets ( Sic1 , Swi5 , Far1 , Cdc6 , Cbl6 , Tec1 , Gcn4 , Hac1 , Rcn1 , and Ctf13 ) for the FBP Cdc4 in yeast , and the nonsense mutation of Cdc4 is lethal to yeast . For instance , mammal nuclear factor-kappaB activation represents a paradigm for controlling the function of a transcription factor via proteolysis ; NF-kappaB precursors are processed into mature active forms of smaller proteins by the UPS . Furthermore , FBPs are not just involved in simple binding interactions with other proteins , as FBPs may also possess specific and intrinsic enzymatic activities of their own ; about 12 % of FBPs have activities beyond ubiquitination . PoFbx23 has 44

[ABSTRACT] Altogether , these results highlight important mechanistic aspects of BM protein secretion and illustrate how BM diversity can emerge from the spatial control of distinct traffic routes . We also found that the dystrophin-associated protein complex ( DAPC ) and Rab10 were both present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins . When both routes were abolished , BM production was fully blocked ; however , genetic interactions revealed that these two routes competed . However , the traffic routes associated with BM formation and the mechanistic modulations explaining its diversification are still poorly understood . Rab10 promoted lateral and planar-polarized secretion , whereas Rab8 promoted basal secretion , leading to the formation of BM fibrils and homogenous BM , respectively . The basement membrane ( BM ) is an essential structural element of tissues , and its diversification participates in organ morphogenesis . Here , we determined the specific molecular identity and cell exit sites of BM protein secretory routes . Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium relies on a BM composed of oriented BM fibrils and a more homogenous matrix . First , we found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM protein secretion . DAPC was essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route . First , the Exo70 subunit directly interacted with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization . Moreover , we identified a dual function for the exocyst complex in this context . Second , the exocyst complex was also required for the Rab8 route .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The fact that Rab8 and Rab10 share a similar function ( BM protein secretion ) , but with a different output ( homogenous vs fibrillar BM ) , in a highly tractable system for genetics and imaging , offers a unique opportunity to thoroughly investigate their molecular and mechanistic specificities . On the basis of the present results , we propose the co-existence of parallel secretory routes orchestrated by these Rab proteins with different cell exit sites defined by cell polarity axes as the basic mechanism to explain BM diversification during development . Our work brings new mechanistic insights into how BM proteins are secreted in epithelial cells and demonstrates that BM diversification during development can arise from the existence of different secretory routes with different cell exit sites . The same three Rab GTPases have been jointly involved in different processes such as ciliogenesis , targeted exocytosis or lysosome homeostasis where they have been proposed to act in a redundant manner [ 43-47 ] . Interestingly , the extracellular matrix is different between the myotendinous junction and the interjunctional sarcolemmal basement membrane and may provide another developmental context where several routes targeted to different subcellular domains may be implicated . Their concomitant loss of function phenocopies , to some extent , the double Rab8-Rab10 KD , suggesting that both routes of BM protein basolateral secretion are affected when these kinesins are absent . Nonetheless , given the importance of the DAPC and BM proteins in muscular dystrophies , our results will pave the way to determine whether a similar function is present also in muscle cells . While a direct link between Rab10 and the Khc-73 homolog has been established , one could speculate that Kin1 activity might be more related to the Rab8 route . The high conservation of the interaction domain on Dys , a domain with no other known interacting protein , suggests that this interaction has been conserved during evolution and may be relevant in other contexts . Here , these routes could be considered as partially redundant because they are all involved in BM protein secretion and all three must be knocked down to completely block it . Functional links have been proposed between the exocyst complex and Dg , but they had never been associated through a direct molecular link and Dys involvement was not shown . However , the integration of these routes to cell polarity clearly allowed distinguishing the spatial specificity of these three Rab proteins and revealed that they compete with each other . This link has been shown in other systems , including BM remodeling , suggesting that it might be a general feature of the Rab8-dependent route [ 48-52 ] . Moreover , we showed that Dg distribution all around the cells , when overexpressed , is sufficient to redistribute Rab10 and to induce aberrant BM secretion , confirming a functional link . Thus , these three different Rab proteins , Rab11 , Rab10 and Rab8 , are targeted towards the three distinct domains of epithelial cells defined by apical basal polarity , apical , lateral and basal , respectively . However , these observations mainly came from mammalian cell culture systems with unpolarized cells or from pathological situations where apical basal polarity was disrupted . Part of the answer likely comes from microtubule-associated transport , and two kinesins , Khc-73 and Khc , involved in the basolateral targeting of BM-containing vesicles . Importantly , the absence of basal secretion in Exo70 mutants and the genetic evidence of Exo70 requirement for the Rab8 route confirm that the Rab8 route is targeted towards the basal domain of the cells . Our work identified distinct actors of the Rab8- and Rab10-dependent routes for BM protein secretion , with the involvement of

[ABSTRACT] Specifically , we demonstrate empirically that MTL can mitigate bias from underrepresented subtypes , and that MTL allows the model to learn patterns of co-resistance to combinations of antibodies , thus providing tools to predict antibodies ' epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations . Recently , machine learning models trained using resistance outcomes for multiple antibodies at once , a strategy called multi-task learning ( MTL ) , have been shown to improve predictions . A second challenge is that combinations of bnAbs are required to avoid the inevitable resistance to a single bnAb , and computationally determining optimal combinations of bnAbs is an unsolved problem . One challenge is that some HIV-1 subtypes in currently available training datasets are underrepresented , which likely affects models ' generalizability across subtypes . We develop a new model and show that , beyond the boost in performance , MTL also helps address the previous two challenges . com/iaime/LBUM , can be adapted to other infectious diseases that are treated with antibody therapy . The ability to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs ) will increase bnAb therapeutic benefits . Machine learning is a powerful approach for such prediction . Our analyses , publicly available at https : //github .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Although no solution trumps having all subtypes represented in bnAb data , our results suggest that MTL can alleviate subtype bias if neutralization data with all subtypes is available for antibodies not considered bnAbs ( Figs 1C , S5C and S6C ) . As for previous methods , all models in this work were trained to predict in vitro bnAb resistance : we did not validate them with clinical outcomes , and we relied on data showing correlations between in vitro susceptibility to bnAbs and in vivo outcomes . We first showed that the LBUM 's performance is comparable to that of Gradient Boosting Machine ( GBM ) models and Random Forest ( RF ) models , with some improvements over both methods ( Tables 1 and 2 and S2 Fig and S1 and S2 Files ) . In this regard , our methods can be used to generate hypotheses about epitopes targeted by new antibodies , as long as relevant neutralization data is part of the LBUM 's training data . Nonetheless , some bnAbs had distant contexts despite targeting similar epitopes ( Fig 2 and Table 3 ) , and we highlighted a known example that supports our hypothesis that differences in antibody contexts may capture differences in resistance profiles . Unlike the other two methods , the LBUM does not require aligning input Env sequences , which is an advantage given the incredible variability of Env , including structural variability that makes alignment challenging . A possible limitation is that negatively correlated resistance profiles can possibly lead to similar bnAb contexts , the same way antonyms can have similar word embeddings in the English language . Analyses of structural data on antibodies and their respective targets on Env will help further show the extent to which antibody contexts capture co-resistance patterns . An interesting extension of our methods could be to pretrain using generic protein language models , such as those in the BERT and ESM families . We chose small architectures because of computational requirements imposed by deep neural network models and because of the availability of only small amounts of data on which to fine-tune . Nonetheless , we assumed that such cases were rare if present at all , given that most bnAb contexts tended to cluster per bnAb class ( Table 3 ) . This subtype mismatch is problematic because , as we have shown , models do not necessarily generalize across subtypes ( Figs 1A , S5A and S6A ) . We hope that our analyses can be relevant to other infectious diseases for which monoclonal antibodies are being explored as therapeutic solutions . We compared the LBUM to both RF and GBM models because both boosting trees and RF underlie recently published methods that do not use neural networks . We showed that bnAbs targeting similar epitopes tended to have similar contexts , to such an extent that we could use closeness between antibody contexts to predict antibody epitopes ( Table 3 ) . We introduced the concept of antibody contexts , which we defined as vector representations unique to each antibody and updated during the fine-tuning process . The LBUM was pretrained using Env sequences with no associated neutralization data and fine-tuned with Env sequences with both non-bnAb and bnAb outcome data . A thorough systematic comparison between published methods requires testing different combinations of preprocessing techniques , feature selection methods and learning algorithms . In this work , we only compared learning algorithms applied on full Env sequences with neutralization data preprocessed similarly . We expect MTL models ' performance to increase as their size increases along with the increase in the quantity and diversity of their training data . In summary , we developed a model to predict the neutralization of different HIV-1 Env sequences by different broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs ) . All models developed in this work , along

The candidate model is further compared with the gene-based model and previously published models in two external data . com/ShuoStat/MMMs ) , where a missing data imputation method was also integrated to facilitate future validation . In a nutshell , pathway-based models ( using group lasso ) were competitive alternatives to gene-based models for MM . The former simply converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for model fitting . Immune information , including VAX pathways , seemed to be more predictive for MM . We also investigated the effects of missing values on prediction . These models were documented in an R package ( https : //github . Vax ( grp ) also outperformed the previously published models . [ INTRODUCTION ] [ RESULTS ] [ DISCUSSION ] Due to the collinearity of the gene expression profile ( many genes show high correlation with each other ) and the regularization ( e. g. Lasso penalty ) during feature selection , the genes selected in the model are not readily interpretable as genes correlated with the selected ones may be randomly dropped by the model , but they may have important biological functions . For example , in our study , the two most predictive models are those based on immune-related pathways , which is consistent with the fact that Multiple Myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells , which produce antibodies and therefore are a critical component of the adaptive immune system . To make our method more generalizable , a border benchmark study in the future is required to test whether the pathway-based models improve patient stratification in our cancer types and which knowledge database should be used for a specific disease . Most importantly , any models still need to undergo rigorous clinical trials before the approved by regulatory bodies , such as the FDA in the United States or the EMA in Europe , and the eventual applications in routine clinical practice . Secondly , while our model proposed Vax , a computational pathway database of vaccination related gene expression changes , as the best source of pathway knowledge , the evidence of biological relevance is currently unclear , and awaits experimental validation . Building pathway models is guided by existing knowledge , which can reduce the sample size requirement and allow us to build on previous research findings , rather than starting from scratch . Secondly , our model can also benefit from further optimization , such as including clinical parameters as additional predictors as well as implementing other machine learning/AI methods for deriving pathway scores and prediction . For mechanism research , instead of using a single model to identify reliable pathway information , we recommend conducting stability analysis on these proposed models and prioritizing these frequently selected pathways for subsequent research . Among the three pathway score methods , ssGSEA seems to be more reliable probably because its calculation merely relies on gene ranks without the adjustment of background samples . On the other hand , the pathway-based models first summarize the individual gene expression changes on pathway activity level , which can be considered as a pathway-guided dimension reduction and denoise process . The other selected pathways were also investigated by previous studies , including vaccine responses to HIV , Measles , Shingles , Human papillomaviruses ( HPV ) , Tuberculosis , and Influenza [ 69-78 ] . However , we acknowledge that significant work remains to be done before these models can be implemented in clinical settings or impact therapeutic decision-making . The challenge for pathway score methods is that they can not capture sufficient information , which may account for the inferior performance compared with group lasso . Including disease-specific clinical parameters , such as tumor stages , genomic background , and so on , may provide additional power to our prediction model . The resulting model not only serves as a prognostic tool but also highlights the functions relevant to the disease , owing to the sparsity property of the Lasso regression . Between the two strategies , group lasso was better off for the majority of pathways , and achieved the best prediction when combined with VAX pathways .

[ABSTRACT] We develop a nonlinear dynamical systems model of dynamin related protein one ( Drp1 ) -dependent mitochondrial fission and use it to identify parameters which can regulate the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time . The TFR defined from a nondimensionalization of the model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k - where M is the total concentration of mitochondrial fission factor ( Mff ) and k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane . Though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters , we found the TFR and the cumulative total fission ( TF ) depend strongly on only one , μ. Interestingly , the cumulative TF does not monotonically increase as μ increases . Thus , there is a critical need to understand the molecular mechanisms coordinating and regulating the complex process of mitochondrial fission . Mitochondrial hyperfission in response to cellular insult is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death . This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests interventions targeting k+ , k− , or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism . Thus understanding the impact of regulatory parameters , such as μ , may assist future therapeutic target selection . Instead it increases with μ to a certain point and then begins to decrease as μ continues to increase . The variable μ can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Since individual variations in these parameters affected the qualitative behavior of the TFR ( Fig 6 ) and caused the variation seen in the cumulative TF ( Tables 2 and 3 and Fig 8 ) , we expected the combination μ = k + M k - , which can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane , to also have an effect . Through this investigation , we found the number of fission events per second , the TFR ( Eq ( 15 ) ) depends strongly on k+ , k− , and M. Individual variations in these three parameters cause the TFR curve to transition from damped oscillations that reach a steady-state to sustained , stable oscillations . With a nonlinear dynamical system , sensitivity analyses , a nondimensionalization of the system , and a bifurcation analysis we begin to understand how certain parameters affect the total fission rate ( TFR ) which is the number of fission events per second . Incorporating more complex biological processes like ER-mitochondria interactions would possibly call for association and dissociation rate constants k+ and k− that depend on oligomer size or oligomer location on the OMM . If we consider β = k 1 M k - to be less than 5 and fix μ to be greater than or equal to the bifurcation value , which is the value of μ where the TFR transitions to sustained oscillations , there appears to be another bifurcation with bifurcation parameters β and μ ( Fig 11A and 11C ) . Like the TFR , the cumulative TF , which is the total number of fission events over a set time , depends heavily on k+ , k− , and M. The largest cumulative TF values occur when k+ and M are large ( Fig 7 ) . Either model addition would affect the available pool of cytosolic Drp1 and possibly cause the total concentration of Drp1 ( T ) to have more of an effect on the TFR and the cumulative TF . Since the Fission Model approximates a mechanism with Drp1 in excess in the cytsol , a future direction involves investigating how a smaller pool of cytosolic Drp1 affects the TFR and the cumulative TF . Under extreme metabolic or environmental stress , mitochondria can enter a state of hyperfission which leads to lower functioning , smaller mitochondria and an increase in programmed cell death . Drp1 is know to reside on the outer membrane of the ER , and the ER forms close contacts with mitochondria at the eventual fission site marking where fission will occurr . Thus the system of equations can be simplified with a quasi-steady-state approximation by setting the equation for T ˙ ( Eq ( 10 ) ) equal to zero . A distribution for mitochondrial circumference could be incorporated into the fission function f ( i ) which would aid in the understanding of how mitochondrial circumference impacts the number of fission events per second . The cumulative TF for the nondimensionalization also depends almost entirely on μ suggesting the cumulative TF can be well approximated as a function of μ ( Tables 2 and 3 and Fig 11A ) . Oscillations have been observed in variables associated with mitochondrial dynamics such as ATP production , Ca2+ levels , and mitochondrial membrane voltage [ 30-32 ] . This decreases the number of equations from 32 to 30 but unfortunately does not aid in the solving for the steady state solutions . Also , actin filaments and myosin II have been shown to stimulate a maturation process of an oligomer poised for fission to an active fission complex .

[ABSTRACT] Our investigation revealed only a low level of homing in the germline , but feeding octopamine restored the egg-laying defects in Tdc2 mutant females , allowing easier line maintenance than for other suppression drive targets . We tested the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency . Our findings show that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles , and the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity . Furthermore , this study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive , offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects . In this study , we constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( Tdc2 ) in Drosophila suzukii , a notorious fruit pest . One approach to mitigate the development of resistance involves targeting functionally constrained regions using multiple gRNAs . CRISPR-based gene drives offer promising prospects for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests . A significant challenge for successful suppression-type drive is the rapid evolution of resistance alleles .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While the fecundity of heterozygous females in our individual crosses was not apparently different from wild-type , this may not be the case in population cages , which might be more vulnerable to changes of food condition , population density , peer competition for resources , etc . We suspect that the insertion of a large gene drive cassette in the Tdc2 locus might impact neighboring Tdc1 expression and partially rescue the Tdc2 phenotype , potentially allowing the issue to be solved with drive design adjustments such as reversing the orientation of some genes within the drive . Using gene drive to manage invasive pest SWD is a promising and innovative approach , but as a species with a high level of genetic polymorphism , such genetic background may have a significant impact on the effective spread of gene drive through populations . However , a single injection of donor plasmid containing gRNAs and our vasa-Cas9 into the embryo of SWD achieved successful genome editing , which showed , together with some drive activity , that our vasa promoter was functional in this system . This may facilitate large-scale breeding of gene drive flies and contribute to commercial production , reducing costs , implying rearing , and potentially even allowing mass-rearing strategies and continuous releases that require reduced drive performance for successful suppression . In our system , the vasa promoter ( which has usually given similar germline performance to nanos in D. melanogaster ) element was perhaps missing too much of the middle portion of the 5 ' UTR to retain normal expression levels . Another plausible explanation is that the function of Tdc2 is not fully conserved between these two fly species , implying that SWD Tdc2 might not be an optimal target gene due to the observed incomplete sterility . Our research demonstrated the robust use of the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tool to construct fGD systems targeting the haplosufficient female fertility gene Tdc2 in both the agricultural pest SWD and the model insect D. melanogaster . Second , the efficiency of the Cas9 and/or gRNA expression system may have been low , perhaps due to position effects that neighboring genetic elements surrounding the transgene insertion site suppress Cas9 expression . The results in our study also showed that the homing rate of gene drive alleles could potentially be influenced by genetic polymorphisms in the gRNA targeting sites and homology regions . However , introducing Cas9 protein from another genomic source greatly increased the efficiency of the gene drive system , indicating that position effects may partially account for our SWD results . Unlike D. melanogaster , the female SWD Tdc2 null mutants are still able to lay small numbers of viable eggs , and we did not explore the reason for this . It is also possible that the observed fitness costs manifest in other ways , such as affecting egg viability ( rather than fecundity ) , or even affecting the mating success of males . First , sequence polymorphism in gene drive modified organisms can greatly influence the efficacy of gene drive element spread in the population and thus may have negatively affected our drive . However , the fGD system implemented in SWD did not exhibit high super-mendelian homing efficiency , so it could not spread through the population in cage trials . As gene drive elements propagate throughout the population , they can trigger the emergence of resistance alleles due to the end-joining repair , thereby impacting the efficiency of the gene drive . In certain gene drive systems that aim to induce female infertility by targeting haplosufficient genes , it is impossible to reverse the infertility phenotype in drive homozygous females .

[ABSTRACT] Based on a parsimonious energy model , we propose two plasticity restricting algorithms that save energy : 1 ) only modify synapses with large updates , and 2 ) restrict plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network . Experiments have shown that learning simple conditioning tasks which might require only a few synaptic updates , already carries a significant metabolic cost . In biology networks are often much larger than the task requires , yet vanilla backprop prescribes to update all synapses . In particular in this case , large savings can be achieved while only incurring a slightly worse learning time . Yet , learning a task like MNIST to 95 % accuracy appears to require at least 108 synaptic updates . The brain is not only constrained by energy needed to fuel computation , but it is also constrained by energy needed to form memories . Moreover , the algorithms might benefit hardware because also electronic memory storage is energetically costly . Therefore the brain has likely evolved to be able to learn using as little energy as possible . The results might lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a better match between artificial and biological learning . We explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks . Thus competitively restricting plasticity helps to save metabolic energy associated to synaptic plasticity .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Extrapolating Fig 1 , if plasticity were distributed over all these synapses ( as backprop prescribes ) , the number of synaptic updates would be some 105 times larger than required . For neural networks that learn more complicated tasks , energy costs can according to our model become very high , in particular when networks are large . This is most efficient when the plasticity on input and output side of a neuron are coordinated , so that when inputs of a neuron are modified then so are its outputs . In particular the independence assumption is unlikely to be fully correct ; yet even the sign of the interactions ( cooperative vs competitive ) is unknown . Future studies could include how the saving algorithms should be automatically adapted dependent on task difficulty or network architecture . As more experimental data becomes available , the energy model can be refined and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms can be re-examined . Given the lack of biological data and the uncertain nature of the main energy consumer , our proposed energy model is currently coarse . The M1 energy , which increases less steeply with network size , would still be some 700 times larger , Fig 5 . Finally , we did not consider the energy required for neural signaling , such as synaptic transmission and spike generation . It might be that there is a large component independent of synapse number , for example energy needed for replay processes . Such terms , either constant or proportional to the number of training cycles are easily added to the cost model . This is also consistent with neuroscience data , where typically a threshold for plasticity induction has been observed . Such effects have indeed been observed in experiments , although the precise rules appear complex [ 38-40 ] . Our study suggests the presence of a competitive algorithm in which only a certain fraction of synapses is modified . Thus large networks are powerful , but without restrictions the metabolic cost of plasticity could become very large . Finally , it also possible to skip over uninformative samples during learning , leading to even further saving . In that case , the question is at what number of synapses the energy becomes approximately extensive in synapse number . Another interesting avenue is to find the most energy efficient synaptic modification during transfer learning , c. f. . For instance , macaque V1 has some 150 million neurons and some 300 × 109 synapses . Biophysically , the competition on the neuron level could naturally follow from resource constraints . These strategies can be combined with our earlier work on synaptic caching . We further assumed that the energy is extensive in the number of synapses . Experiments have shown that already simple associative learning is metabolically costly . Ultimately , learning rules should aim to also reduce those costs . Second , express plasticity only in synapses with large updates . We have introduced two approaches to reduce costs . First , restrict plasticity to a subset of synapses .

[ABSTRACT] We investigated how and to what extent laboratory evolution could overcome these defects in six variants of the transposon-free Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx that each had a deletion of a different 22- to 42-kilobase region and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases . The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd ( ribonuclease D ) , csrA ( RNA-binding carbon storage regulator ) , and hfq ( RNA-binding protein and chaperone ) were frequently mutated across all strains , though the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment . More generally , our results demonstrate that fitness lost during genome streamlining can usually be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution and that recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments . We evolved replicate populations of ADP1-ISx and each deletion strain for ~300 generations in a chemically defined minimal medium or a complex medium and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates . Mutations in this regulatory network likely compensate for how an earlier deletion of a transposon in the ADP1-ISx ancestor of all the deletion strains restored csrA function . During natural or engineered genome streamlining , deletion of many non-essential genes in combination often reduces bacterial fitness for idiosyncratic or unknown reasons . Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors . Synthetic biologists have purposefully engineered streamlined microbial genomes to create more efficient cellular chassis and define the minimal components of cellular life . Fitness increased in all cases that were examined except for two ancestors that each failed to improve in one of the two environments . Organelles and endosymbionts have naturally evolved dramatically reduced genome sizes compared to their free-living ancestors .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Given that microbes that naturally evolve extremely reduced genomes generally become less robust , it remains to be seen how far these endeavors that seek to build , remodel , and evolve streamlined genomes can be pushed , whether their goals are to optimize microbial cell factories or understand the essential genetic architectures of cellular life . Further streamlining of A. baylyi genomes to include these deletions and others that could not be constructed would require debugging , for example , by adding back any `` irreplaceable '' genes that are needed to restore viability and fitness in ways that evolution on laboratory timescales can not achieve . Prior evolutionary studies of reduced-genome E. coli observed changes in translation rather than post-transcriptional regulation , and there was little fitness recovery for reduced-genome B. subtilis strains in a complex medium , suggesting that mutations in different global processes may be more beneficial in different organisms with different sets of genes deleted . Yet , mutations in both rnd and csrA evolved in at least one descendant of every engineered deletion stain and their ADP1-ISx progenitor , so-despite the idiosyncratic effects of specific mutations-altering this regulatory network in some way is widely beneficial . In these cases , the engineered deletion seems to have eliminated one more genes with a function that can not be fulfilled by mutations altering the expression and activities of the remaining genes , at least through evolutionary pathways that were accessible in this short experiment . The widespread mutations that we observed in genes involved in post-transcriptional regulation in ADP1-ISx , including csrA , suggest that this earlier transposon insertion was beneficial and that we are observing multiple ways that evolution can reoccur to similarly alter global gene regulation in A. baylyi . In the more common cases where adaptation was able to recover lost fitness and even surpass the fitness of the ancestral strains , certain genes were recurrently mutated in specific environments and in specific deletion strain backgrounds , likely because these mutations compensate for lost functions . Future work , reconstructing these mutations and measuring their effects on gene expression and fitness , alone and in combination , could validate our statistical correlations and map the genetic interactions in this network that are important for robust A. baylyi growth . Other significant associations included enrichment of mutations in a putative small RNA located in the recD/ACIAD0400 intergenic region in MSD1 in LB and various genes involved in natural competence in MGD12 in MS. A. baylyi ADP1 has been evolved in the laboratory in several prior experiments [ 28-30 ] . These types of global changes in transcription make sense in the context of the increased expression of genes controlled by the stationary phase sigma factor ( rpoS ) that are observed in other reduced-genome E. coli strains ( MDS42 and MDS69 ) . Thus , it appears that re-tuning global regulatory processes ( e. g. , transcription , translation ) is often the most expeditious and generalizable way for evolution to improve the fitness of both wild-type genomes and less-fit reduced genomes . Because the ADP1-ISx deletions studied here did not differentiate the targeted genes by any criteria beyond essentiality when they were planned and constructed , the deletions that did not recover growth likely contained some of these types of genes . Despite encountering some limitations , the overwhelming result of our study is that evolution is useful for mechanistically probing why there are fitness defects after specific gene deletions and for recovering the fitness of reduced-genome strains . Their association with certain ancestors and environments in our

[ABSTRACT] Using an in vivo reporter strategy , we first show that inserting the T3H48 self-cleaving ribozyme in an intron enables rapid pre-mRNA cleavage , with up to 20-fold reduction in expression , and that this ribozyme displays superior activity compared with other ribozymes . Furthermore , we show that a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter in the RiboFlip cassette can label knocked-down cells independently of the expression of the target gene . We then inserted the T3H48 ribozyme in the second intron of the albino gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and observed a pigmentation phenotype similar to that in the mutant . Altogether , we introduce the RiboFlip cassette as a flexible tool to control endogenous gene expression in a vertebrate model and as an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies . In addition , we generated a Flippase- and Cre-activatable version of the T3H48 ribozyme , called RiboFlip , to control the mRNA levels of the albino gene . Using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme , we also show that this phenotype is reversible , illustrating the specificity of the approach . Here , we develop a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebrafish . Precise regulation of gene expression is essential to understand a wide range of biological processes . Control over gene expression can be achieved using site-directed recombinases and endonucleases . RiboFlip activation induced mRNA knockdown and also recapitulated the albino mutant phenotype . However , their efficiency is variable and dependent on the genomic context .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This difference could be due to a positional effect of the ribozyme , whose folding depends on the neighboring sequences , or by the shorter insulating sequence used in this experiment to reduce the size of the ssODN donor for knockin . Considering the high stability of melanin , the recovery in albHHR/HHR larvae is likely due to Alb protein accumulation , since the ribozyme cleavage efficiency did not appear to diminish over time ( S2g Fig ) . Although TagBFP expression became visible after Gal4 expression , the signal was weak and mosaic , possibly due to a suboptimal design , as a large sequence separates the UAS from the TagBFP , or to the genomic context in the alb gene . We also used CRISPR/Cas9 knockin strategies to insert an inducible T3H48-HHR cassette called RiboFlip and show that this system can trigger conditional gene knockdown of the endogenous alb gene . We propose this approach as an new method to turn off the activity of HHR ribozymes in vivo , notably as an alternative to aptamers designed to change the conformation of self-cleaving ribozymes upon drug binding . To that end , we created a RiboFlip cassette that switches T3H48-HHR to a sense orientation following Flippase or Cre recombination and inserted it in the second intron of the alb gene . Moreover , the mRNA knockdown rate of more than 90 % that we observed in vivo with the GFP reporter system and in the alb locus has never been achieved with other tools . Furthermore , we integrated in the RiboFlip cassette heterotypic ROXP or ROX12 sites ; these sites can be used to remove the remaining RiboFlip elements after knocking in another cassette containing a ROX site . However , in the absence of a mutant allele showing reduced alb expression without lesions in the coding sequence , this explanation remains hypothetical and should be tested . Intronic cleavage could increase the number of potential landing sites to insert the ribozyme and avoid the destabilization of the mRNA when fused with a drug-inducible aptamer . We also included in the RiboFlip cassette multiple universal CRISPR sites that can be used to turn RiboFlip into a landing site for additional knockins . For future studies , a short ubiquitous promoter would probably be preferable to the UAS , which requires the use of an additional Gal4 line . The Cre recombination induced a weaker knockdown than the Flippase one , possibly due to the difference in the sequence flanking the ribozyme , which could alter folding . In our study , we used T3H48-HHR in zebrafish to modulate the mRNA levels produced from a reporter transgene as well as the alb gene . Moreover , hypomorphic phenotypes generated by ribozyme cleavage could be used to investigate genes for which the knockout results in early lethality . We anticipate that these universal CRISPR sites could be used as alternative landing sites to the existing attP used for phiC31-mediated knockin . We reasoned that integrating the ribozyme in an antisense orientation would prevent its cleavage , as was recently shown in a transgenic setting . Self-cleaving ribozymes are already used to control the expression of transgenes and endogenous genes in multiple models [ 6-8 , 10-15 ] . In summary , our findings indicate that T3H48-HHR can mediate rapid gene knockdown in a vertebrate model when inserted in an intron . Moreover , this ribozyme can be induced conditionally using recombinases and represents a flexible alternative to existing knock-down strategies . We inserted the ribozyme in the second intron of the alb gene , in a CRISPR site previously used to induce large deletions . We hypothesize that the secondary structure of the ribozyme , which is essential for cleavage

Convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) can detect these structures also in only transmitted light images . It is agnostic to computational environments and does not require user expert coding experience . aiSEGcell is accessible through both a command line , and a napari graphical user interface . However , this approach currently requires optimized experimental conditions and computational specialists . Segmentation is required to quantify cellular structures in microscopic images . We provide this curated ground-truth data with 1 . This typically requires their fluorescent labeling . 1 million nuclei in 20 , 000 images .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Hence , users can retrain an existing aiSEGcell model or train a new aiSEGcell model to segment other objects in different 2D image modalities , for example fluorescently labeled blood vessels or cell organelles in electron microscopy , etc. , further enhancing its utility in a wide range of applications . We now show that nuclear segmentations in BF are also feasible in challenging common experimental conditions like low magnification , and time lapse imaging of e. g. small non-adherent primary murine and human hematopoietic cells imaged in microfluidic and other culture devices . Notably , we prove that these segmentations are so similar to manual segmentation that they retain biologically meaningful information even when using the segmentation as the basis for quantification of difficult and noisy reporters like biosensors for cell signaling dynamics . Hence , we share our data sets D1-5 containing manually curated nuclear marker ground truth segmentations of more than 20 , 000 images , or 1 , 100 , 000 nuclei , covering 11 unique cell types ( one cell line , 10 primary cell types ; Figs 1-3 and Table 1 ) . New machine learning methods are often available as public code repositories that lack the necessary testing to ensure compatibility with different computational environments and are not actively maintained . The ability to generalize to many use cases is a sought-after feature in trained neural networks and it is crucial for democratizing access to state-of-the-art machine learning . At a broader level , we show how aiSEGcell enables new experimental workflows and its utility in jointly investigating multiple signaling pathways , differentiation markers , and control variables . For the first time , we introduce a software for segmenting nuclei in BF images , proven to work across various computational environments and user coding proficiency levels . Here , we demonstrate that aiSEGcell pretrained on a large data set requires only approximately 30 images to drastically improve segmentation for new use cases . We demonstrate that aiSEGcell can thus add biological information to an experiment previously constrained due to e. g. poor fluorophore markers in an existing transgenic mouse model . 1 million nuclei , these data sets are among the largest publicly available data sets for fluorescence or label free nucleus segmentation to date [ 34-37 ] . Previous research has demonstrated that neural networks can detect nuclei and other cell organelles in transmitted light images under optimized conditions . More specifically , we explore the effect of NfκB signaling dynamics on the differentiation of mGMPGM and correct for the cell cycle as a potential covariate . Consequently , aiSEGcell retraining is feasible for users with little computational resources and improves access to state-of-the-art image segmentation . In contrast , here we find that cell cycle progression does not affect NfκB signaling responses to TNFα stimulation in mGMPGM cells . We describe aiSEGcell , a user-friendly software to segment nuclei from only BF images without the need for fluorescent nuclear labeling . This is further accentuated in notoriously difficult to train neural networks implemented in complex frameworks that are subject to frequent changes . By freeing up a fluorescent channel , aiSEGcell facilitates the exploration of additional fluorescent markers or the reduction of phototoxicity and required imaging times . Thus , we believe that our data sets can be a valuable resource to the community in advancing image segmentation software . Other signaling pathways like ERK in mESCs change their response dynamics depending on CC phases . Therefore , it is crucial to release scientific software that is well documented and accessible to programming novices . Programming experience is a major limiting factor preventing the broader adoption of machine learning in biology . However , microscopy data are highly diverse and siloed impeding the availability of broadly representative data sets . We release aiSEGcell with already trained models to segment

[ABSTRACT] Testing how feature speed could affect learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature , and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes . To test this idea , 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward . Across two experiments and one preregistered replication , participants accrued more reward when a bandit 's relevant feature changed slowly , and its irrelevant feature quickly , as compared to the opposite . One such property is the rate of change of features , given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise . We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features . The larger the improvement in participants ' performance for slow compared to fast bandits , the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates . These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features , suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning . Hence , we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast . We did not find a difference in the ability to generalise to unseen feature values between conditions . Identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our findings are in line with previous research showing that priors have a pervasive influence on behaviour , shaping perception , remaining stable in the face of exposure to contradictory training , and hindering learning of structures which do not align with them . By providing empirical evidence for the role of a slowness prior in human learning and connecting to a large number of machine learning findings , our study sheds light onto how humans might rapidly learn representations in complex environments . We chose this approach for its computational simplicity , but it remains a potential avenue for future research to set up models which do not assign relevant and irrelevant learning rates a priori , but infer these assignments through learning . While it is reasonable to assume that participants in experiment 2 and the replication knew the speed of the features based on the preceding observation phase , they could not yet have known which feature was relevant . Nonetheless , the fact that a model with this assumption fits best and participants ' accuracy increased within the first learning trials in a block , lead us to believe that participants quickly developed a sense for the relevance of the features . To investigate whether humans employ a slowness prior to identify potentially relevant features during reinforcement learning , we tested participants in a decision-making task with stimuli composed of one reward-predictive and one reward-irrelevant feature . Previous work has shown how representation learning can be implemented in parallel to reinforcement learning by using feedback signals to guide selective attention , or through replay mechanisms during offline periods . One possibility in this regard is that meta-learning , or learning to learn , is the core mechanism that humans use in order to extract regularities of their environment and develop priors that aid perception and learning . Although these approaches represent flexible mechanisms that allow on-the-fly adaptation to the current environment , it is unlikely to be feasible in environments with hundreds of possible signals to attend to . In our task , slow blocks were more likely to be ordered than fast blocks , but due to the periodic nature of our feature-reward mapping , ordering might not be immediately apparent in either condition . For instance , the temporal auto-correlation of features and rewards inherent to a slowly changing environment could enable the use of heuristic strategies , such as a win-stay-lose-shift rule . However , it is worth noting that interleaved training might promote the formation of more generaliseable representations , suggesting that the optimal learning curriculum may differ depending on the task at hand . It is for instance possible that the dynamics of learning rates are influenced by a number of additional factors , such as volatility or the size of prediction errors [ 69-71 ] . Our findings also relate to previous work on curriculum learning , which has shown that humans benefit from blocked , rather than interleaved , training on a context-dependent categorisation task . Specifically the learning rates for the relevant features mediated the behavioural effect , suggesting that the observed behavioural differences between conditions were being driven by increased learning from the slow feature and decreased learning from the fast feature . In the blocked curriculum the relevant features for categorisation were the same across trials , whereas in the interleaved curriculum the relevant features could switch from trial to trial , even though the stimuli characteristics changed in both curricula . Despite its simplicity , the task itself posed a considerable challenge to participants , as indicated by their end-of-learning performance , which still left room for improvement . Importantly , assuming relevant processes change slowly only is a useful assumption given the physical laws that govern our world

[ABSTRACT] CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed to the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model ( MMTV-PyMT ) demonstrated that reduction of Resf1 resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth , a shortened overall survival time , and increased incidence and number of lung metastases , consistent with patient data . Patients with ER-negative breast cancer have the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes , often experiencing rapid recurrence or progression to metastatic disease shortly after diagnosis . Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Resf1 in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences , particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis . These results suggest that loss of Resf1 enhances tumor progression in ER- breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control . Furthermore , an analysis of matched tail and primary tissues revealed loss of the wildtype copy in tumor tissue , consistent with Resf1 being a tumor suppressor . Given that metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors , understanding metastatic biology is crucial for effective intervention . Here , we extend those studies to identify Resf1 , a poorly characterized gene , as a novel metastasis susceptibility gene in ER- breast cancer . Resf1 is a large , unstructured protein with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure , but with poor amino acid conservation . Using a mouse systems genetics approach , we previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This is exemplified by analysis of the RPL27 , where RESF1 showed significant association only across exon 3 , which contains three DNA G4s distributed on both strands , while the other exons have single predicted DNA G4 quadruplexes , all restricted to the non-template strand . The generation and validation of the mouse western blot compatible antibody combined with subcellular fractionation suggest that RESF1 is primarily a nucleoplasmic protein , though staining of the dTAG CRISPR knockin cells suggests that RESF1 is capable of translocating into the nucleolus and nuclear speckle under some circumstances . Because this gene-trap animal has not been extensively characterized and single-gene tumor expression studies can be confounded by amplifications or deletions that include additional genes that might influence the phenotype , we incorporated a second CRISPR-mediated Resf1 KO animal into the study . Despite the concerns regarding the physiological validity of cell line-based models for investigations into the role of RESF1 in metastatic disease , we initiated a series of mechanistic-based studies to identify potential cell line-based RESF1 metastasis-associated pathways or mechanisms that might be subsequently investigated or validated in vivo models . Therefore , while RESF1 may function as a minor histocompatibility antigen in tumor-graft rejection , it does not appear to play a significant role in metastatic progression , at least in the cell line-based orthotopic transplant spontaneous metastasis models . However , the variable outcomes in sphere assays among mouse and human breast cancer cell lines suggest potential cell line-specific effects of RESF1 in stemness , challenging the notion that RESF1 's previously reported functions directly drive its metastatic phenotype . Evidence of stable transduction was observed in only one cell line , at a level insufficiently low for further molecular analyses ( S12A and S12B Fig ) , suggesting there is an upper limit for RESF1 for cell viability in tissue culture conditions . The concordance of the results within the allograft or the GEMM autochthonous tumor samples and models suggests that Resf1 may have diametrically opposite effects on primary tumor growth and metastatic disease , as has been observed for TGFβ . However , to date , repeated efforts to identify protein interaction partners have been unsuccessful , suggesting that RESF1 protein interactions may be transient and/or of low avidity that is not amenable to standard immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry methods . Moreover , although the gene structure is conserved across species , the amino acid sequence and size of the resulting protein are highly variable , with few conserved regions , most of which appear to be concentrated in the carboxy third of the protein . This interpretation was supported by the experimental cross between the Resf1 gene trap and the PyMT mouse , where animals with reduced Resf1 expression had higher incidence of metastatic disease and increased numbers of pulmonary metastases . The gene and the intron-exon structure are conserved across species ; however , the primary amino acid sequence shows substantially more sequence divergence between species than the average gene ( 44 % identities compared to an average of ~85 % for mouse versus human ) . 5 % of the top RESF1-associated sites contained 2 or more predicted DNA G4 quadruplexes on at least one strand , suggesting RESF1 specifically associates with sequences capable of forming complex secondary structures formed by multiple DNA G4 quadruplexes . Since disordered protein domains are thought to be stabilized by post-translational modifications or interactions with binding partners , RESF1 's secondary or tertiary structure may be more critical to protein function than the primary sequence . Finally , while RNA-seq analysis revealed relatively modest transcriptional effects upon RESF1 depletion , the in vivo expression data pointed towards the suppression of EMT-associated pathways following RESF1 loss ( summarized in Table 1 ) .

[ABSTRACT] Despite these differences , complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs-rare in wild-type cells-occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1 , suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both . Here , we utilise two strategies-deletion of the mismatch repair protein , Msh2 , and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor-to help characterise the roles Mec1 and Rad24 play in meiotic recombination by enabling genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny . Collectively , in addition to shared roles in CO regulation , our results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor , and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency , the loss of which helps to suppress any broader defects in CO regulation caused by abrogation of the DDR . During meiosis , programmed DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme , Spo11 , activating the DNA damage response ( DDR ) kinase Mec1ATR via the checkpoint clamp loader , Rad24RAD17 . Such effects are similar to , but less extreme than , the phenotype of 'ZMM ' mutants such as zip3Δ , and may be driven by reductions in the proportion of interfering COs. At single loci , loss of Mec1 and Rad24 activity alters DSB formation and recombination outcome , but their genome-wide roles have not been examined in detail . In line with previous studies , we observe severely impacted spore viability and a reduction in the frequency of recombination upon deletion of RAD24-driven by a shortened prophase . By contrast , loss of Mec1 function increases recombination frequency , consistent with its role in DSB trans-interference , and has less effect on spore viability . Upon loss of either Mec1 or Rad24 , CO distributions become more random-suggesting reductions in the global manifestation of interference . Mec1 and Rad24 also have important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers ( COs ) .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Taking observations collectively , we speculate that the prior inference for a specific ( Mec1-independent ) role for Rad24 on ZMM loading may stem from the fact that global recombination frequencies ( DSBs and CO outcomes ) are lower in rad24Δ strains than in mec1-mn-potentially due to the loss of DSB trans interference in mec1-mn strains . Interestingly , the effects of mec1-mn described here are similar to those of pch2 mutation , which has been found to cause global increases in DSBs and COs. pch2 mutants also have a significantly lower incidence of non-exchange chromosomes , and CO interference appears weaker compared to wild type . Moreover , given the essential role that COs play in chromosome segregation and fertility in most sexually reproducing organisms , it will be of great interest to clarify whether the DDR checkpoint clamp and/or loader play similar roles across other species as they do in S. cerevisiae . Nevertheless , it seems logical that such biases will tend towards less extreme , more wild type-like phenotypes , suggesting that the characteristics we report here for rad24Δ and mec1-mn are likely to underestimate the true extent of the defects occurring during meiosis . In general , the patches of genetic change arising per recombination event ( event length ) were also larger upon RAD24 deletion than in the mec1-mn strains ( Fig 5D-5G ) , perhaps in part due to small differences in the extent of hyper-resection observed in these two strains . In summary , the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1 causes COs to be spaced more randomly with greater variance in distances between them , and suggests that this is due to partial loss of Zip3 activity per recombination event in both strains . Thus , both Rad24 and Mec1 may have similar defects in class I CO formation ( per DSB event ) , but that this defect is substantially rescued by a global increase in recombination ( in absolute terms ) in mec1-mn strains making it appear that ZMM loading is not substantially affected . However , since ndt80AR does not have a significant effect on CO distributions compared to wild type ( even when CO numbers differ ) , we believe it reasonable to infer that CO distributions in the rad24Δ strain will not be significantly different from the rad24Δ ndt80AR strain described here , despite differences in CO numbers . Supporting this view , loss of Zip3 function had a largely dissimilar phenotype to both rad24Δ and mec1-mn , suggesting that the primary defect in either DDR mutant is not loss of ZMM loading , but more likely a combined effect of this defect and loss of the meiotic prophase checkpoint . Moreover , no elevation in total event count is observed upon inactivation of rad24Δ , unlike in zip3Δ ( Fig 8C ) -suggesting that homologue engagement-dependent DSB suppression ( which is perhaps mediated by Mec1 ) is still sufficiently active in the absence of Rad24 . Such contrast between yeast and Arabidopsis could be due to differences in the regulation of meiosis and the vastly differing genomic architecture that exists between the two species ( such as polymorphism density , chromosome length and number , length of time in prophase and number of COs ; [ 89-91 ] ) . In contrast to the effects of rad24Δ and mec1-mn , msh2Δ alone makes CO distributions less random than in the wild type-something that is conserved in all msh2Δ background strains studied when compared to their controls ( Fig 7A-7H

[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This is extremely important because a reliable in vitro culture method will empower the dissection of Pneumocystis immunology and pathobiology , leading , in the longer-term , to the development of new antifungal therapies that circumvent the emerging resistance of Pneumocystis to azole drugs , and to dramatic advances in Pneumocystis biology and therapy . In addition to the supplementation of nutritional requirements that have been predicted bioinformatically , some of which have been tested already , FBA is capable of predicting how nutrient supplementation might be applied to address metabolic imbalances created , for example by loss of energetic or redox homeostasis . Moreover , FBA does not take account of regulatory effects such as enzyme activation by protein kinases or gene regulation , nor does it consider stress response or signalling pathways , and so its predictions may not always be accurate . By employing a relaxed Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ) approach , we calculated biomass flux values to confirm that our metabolic model is a powerful tool to investigate biological questions that can not be fully explored through conventional bioinformatics and experimental approaches . In order to do so , we reviewed and improved the current Pneumocystis genome annotation by incorporating relevant information from the literature and utilising established bioinformatics tools and then organised this information into a well-defined GEM network . However , in the case of Pneumocystis , the inability to grow this pathogen in vitro has resulted in a lack of critical empirical data on its composition , physiological and biological characteristics , kinetics of nutrient uptake , and enzymatic activities . However , this platform allows us to generate analogous models for other host-specific pathogens , which will provide the basis for the future development of in vitro culture conditions for each of these species . We have also demonstrated that our model can replicate drop-off and gene knockout experiments , highlighting its potential as a valuable tool in the development of new antifungal drug targets . This will enhance the understanding of the metabolic relationships between these pathogens and their host , permit detailed comparison of the metabolic gaps for each of these pathogens , and potentially provide invaluable clues about the potential basis for their species-specificity . We used literature assumptions and available software tools to generate a biomass equation and validated our metabolic model by utilising in vitro growth culture medium conditions proposed by Merali et al . Moreover , due to the deficiency of critical experimental data , we considered reactions in our initial draft reconstruction reversible , despite the fact that the directionality of reactions may have significant impact on the model 's performance . It is worth noting that the reconstruction proposed in this study is subject to revision and refinement in the subsequent versions of the Pneumocystis metabolic model , as more biochemical data become available . The remarkable nature of Pneumocystis , with its extremely reduced genome and dependence on the host for both nutrients and a stable environment , requires special attention in the model development process . Recent genome sequencing has confirmed that the Pneumocystis genus includes several species , each of which is highly specific to a particular mammalian host : human-specific Pneumocystis jirovecii , mouse-specific Pneumocystis murina , rat-specific Pneumocystis carinii and Pneumocystis wakefieldiae , rabbit-specific Pneumocystis oryctolagi , macaque-specific Pneumocystis macacae , and dog-specific Pneumocystis canis . To construct and refine metabolic networks , experimental data on the presence or absence of enzymes , metabolites , and reactions can be integrated with transcriptomic and proteomic data . As a result , incomplete reconstructions may occur and the quality of the constraints used to build the model may be compromised , which limits the efficacy and precision of the FBA approach . The FBA approach , however , can be used to predict how these `` actual '' metabolic gaps may

[ABSTRACT] Finally , this mathematical model , which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway , may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels , developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells , and determining appropriate drug dosages . Herein , a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density , which reflects cell dynamics , into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response . The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells , enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions . However , it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition ( contact inhibition ) under high-density conditions , thereby allowing continuous proliferation . We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics ( MD ) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell . The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density . We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density . We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics . In this study , we construct a three-dimensional ( 3D ) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway . We assume Lennard-Jones ( 12-6 ) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain . This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm , resulting in cell cycle arrest . Conversely , at extremely high cell density , the Hippo pathway , which regulates YAP/TAZ , is activated . Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells . The source codes are freely available .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In this study , we performed 3D multicellular simulations combining MD methods with reaction network models of the Hippo pathway , which is known to regulate cell proliferation by inhibiting YAP/TAZ activity . Our approach effectively simulated cell division and growth , preventing cell overlap by assigning exclusive domains to each cell with LJ ( 12-6 ) potential with a softcore character , and integrating cell cycle dynamics , particularly the M and G1 phases . Our model 's integration of cell dynamics and intra-cellular dynamics could position it as a tool for evaluating cancer malignancy , exploring therapeutic interventions targeting YAP/TAZ , and optimizing drug dosages . To investigate whether the elevated levels of YAP/TAZ observed in cancer tissues are sufficient to sustain chronic proliferation , we developed models representing time evolutions of normal and cancerous tissues . Our 3D simulations revealed that while normal tissues exhibited cell cycle arrest and suppression of exponential growth , cancer tissues with YAP/TAZ levels twice as high demonstrated continuous exponential proliferation . This innovation allowed us to simulate cell proliferation as an output response , providing a more detailed and dynamic representation of how intracellular signaling modulates cell division decisions . These findings suggest that increased YAP/TAZ alone can bypass contact inhibition under high-density conditions , contributing to unchecked proliferation in cancer cells . We introduced a novel modeling component that inputs cell density , reflecting cell dynamics , into the Hippo pathway simulation .

Sequences are characterized by Wasserstein distance relative to thoroughly shuffled or random counterparts .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] To understand the puzzling paradoxes of sequence variability consistent with robust functions , we devised a Free Energy Landscape of Stickers ( FELaS ) : a framework for exploring LCD patterns that may be evolutionarily constrained to possess both short-term material properties and long-term stability required for cellular functions . Phase diagrams and dynamical properties also corroborate the rheological trends ; in the case of periodic LCDs , elastic response and viscosity get higher and become more subdiffusive with an increasing periodicity of the sticker motifs . We anticipate that experiments guided by energy landscape considerations will enable more targeted mutations to systematically alter landscape characteristics , providing direct insights into the relationship between biomolecular sequences and condensate dynamics . Thus , decoding how sticky LCD patterns encode the material properties of condensates promises to shed light on the dynamic behavior of condensates , which are intimately linked to their sequence patterns and cellular functions . In contrast , random sequences show homogeneous unstructured bulk systems , which are more viscous , as demonstrated by an order of magnitude difference in viscous moduli compared to the sequences with more periodic patterns of stickers . Computational models have provided further insights into how low-complexity sticky domains and the local rigidity of LCDs contribute to the loss of ergodic dynamics and the transition to glassy states . Using FELaS , we can dissect how the complexity of LCD patterns quantified by periodicity and disorder in sticky LCD regions impact the dynamics and material properties of resulting condensates . An essential functional role of LCDs appears to lie in their ability to facilitate promiscuous binding and drive phase separation into biomolecular condensates [ 49-51 ] . This framework provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties whereby key features of energy landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable . Overall , our study addresses a critical gap by elucidating the role of sequence complexity in governing the dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condensates . By employing Wasserstein distance , we continuously vary the complexity of the sequence and generate LCD patterns from fully periodic to random sequences . Misregulation of material properties of condensates leads to loss of fluidity and an irreversible transition to solid-like states associated with pathological diseases . We demonstrate that variation of a handful of energy landscape features can capture viscoelastic trends in recent experiments on prion domains . These structural and dynamical implications of LCD patterns are likely key factors influencing the evolutionary development of phase-separating biomolecules . Self-van Hove analysis reveals that a high degree of LCD periodicity can drive the system toward glassy arrested states . However , the functional roles and evolutionary origins of LCDs , particularly those that encode conformationally flexible biomolecules , remain poorly understood . We thus show that one can systematically program protein condensate viscoelasticity by altering the periodicity and stickiness of LCDs . Although the sequences of phase-separating biomolecules can vary , studies have shown that their composition is not random . We find periodic repeats of low-complexity sticker regions display local structure and inhomogeneities in the bulk system . Moreover , recent evidence suggests that specific binding motifs can be replaced by compensatory mutations within sequences . Structurally , interactions within periodic sticky LCD sequences result in a distinct oscillatory exponential decay of tangent correlations . At higher densities , these structures transition into elongated micelles , further evolving into branched , percolated micelles at even greater concentrations . Instead , it follows specific enrichment patterns that promote the fluidity and functional dynamics of condensates . By varying system densities , we also observed that spherical micelle-like structures form at low densities . Despite their functional significance , LCDs exhibit low conservation , as revealed by sequence alignment analyses . Many eukaryotic proteins are characterized by extensive stretches of

[ABSTRACT] Using the mouse dentition as a model , we first establish that non-muscle myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and show that it functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer . Signaling by secreted molecules is critical for epithelial morphogenesis , but how that information leads to cell rearrangement and tissue shape changes remains an open question . Together , our results support a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through myosin II to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination . The development of ectodermal organs begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that progressively invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme as the organ takes its shape . Pharmacological induction of AKT and myosin II can also rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh . Shh signaling controls these processes by inducing myosin II activation via AKT .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our findings here showed that this signaling axis underlies the regulation of MyoII by Shh in the developing incisor , as pAKT was downregulated in cyclopamine-treated samples and pharmacological activation of PI3K/AKT rescued pMLC expression and other cyclopamine-induced phenotypes , including adhesion and cell movement defects . Although MyoII has been shown to exert tension at the contractile ring of dividing cells and is required for cytokinesis in both cultured cells and in some tissues , including the heart [ 58-60 ] , whether it controls cell divisions in the developing tooth was not clear . While Shh is better known for its role as a morphogen to pattern developing tissues and to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation , our results resonate with studies showing that Shh also plays an important role in controlling cell adhesion , cell arrangement , and tissue shape changes during morphogenesis . This is also consistent with prior findings showing that MyoII-generated cellular forces are essential for the maintenance and the growth of adherence junctions in cultured cells , and deletion of myosin IIA and/or IIB results in mislocalized E-cadherin and defective adhesion in mouse embryos . Further dissection of how Shh signals are integrated spatiotemporally to modulate distinct cellular processes and mechanics in the dental placode will be an important next step towards elucidating the mechanism that converts Shh signals into region-specific cell behavioral patterns during tooth morphogenesis . Based on these data , we propose that Shh signaling from the initiation knot controls early tooth development by activating MyoII in the tooth bud , which in turn promotes cell-cell adhesion and persistent cell movement to drive convergent extension and invagination of the incisor epithelium . As myosin II acts at multiple levels to both generate cellular forces and maintain robust intercellular adhesion , their perturbations are compounded in the MyoII mutants , readily impeding the convergent extension-driven narrowing of the dental cord and ultimately the invagination itself . As cell-cell connections normally persist between adjacent basal and suprabasal cells during invagination , losing such connections at a large scale due to the presence of a cyst could disrupt tissue force transmission in MyoII mutants and further add to the invagination phenotype after E13 . Hh also functions in several epithelial monolayer models , including the Drosophila eye imaginal disc and the mouse neural fold , to activate actomyosin contractility at the apical surface and promote apical constriction , facilitating epithelial bending and remodeling [ 77-79 ] . In this context , adhesion provides the anchoring needed to organize actin assembly and actomyosin tension at the tricellular interface , where cell crawling and cell-cell junction shortening are integrated to achieve effective cell intercalation . We found that in the absence of myosin IIA and IIB , cell proliferation can still take place , and divisions were observed throughout the epithelium in live-imaged incisor buds . For instance , Hh signaling is required to maintain strong cell-cell adhesion via cadherins in several epithelial systems , including the larynx epithelium , neuroepithelium , and endothelial cells [ 73-76 ] . Apoptosis alone is also unlikely to be the main cause of the invagination defect , as incisor buds with extensive cell death could still invaginate properly ( S5 Fig ) . Surprisingly , given the role of MyoII in controlling migration , deletion of IIA/B did not abolish cell motility in the incisor , and cell velocities were comparable between controls and mutants . Using live imaging , we showed that even before any cyst formation Myh9/10epi-cko mutant incisors already developed a clear cell movement phenotype at E13 . Future studies will determine the precise role of cell-cell adhesion and the relative contribution by adherence junctions , tight junctions , and desmosomes in regulating cellular rearrangement during these processes . Inhibition of Shh signaling perturbs both invagination and cell-cell adhesion , which are also observed in MyoII mutant incisors and can be rescued upon forced MyoII activation . It is important to note , however , that loss of cell-cell adhesion alone in certain contexts does not appear to

[ABSTRACT] Here , we present a robust deep transfer model based graph convolutional network , scTGCN , which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation , while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption . However , the current label transfer methods have limited performance , largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets . The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological mechanism . We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq . Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data . Thus , scTGCN shows high label transfer accuracy and effectively knowledge transfer across different modalities .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] compared to Seurat , Conos , scJoint and GLUE , the label transfer results demonstrate that scTGCN is an effective and scalable tool for analyzing large single-cell datasets , meanwhile providing valuable insights into complex biological system at the single-cell level . Despite scTGCN methods current focus on integration scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq , the generative distributions can also be adapted to include other types of omics layers , such as protein abundance , histone modification and methylation data . Firstly , scTGCN explore the idea of MK-MMD-based adaption for learning transferable features in graph convolutional network , which co-train labeled scRNA-seq and unlabeled scATAC-seq into a semisupervised paradigm efficiently . Our method is achieved by combining omics-specific autoencoders ( Fig 1c ) with graph convolutional networks and transfer learning , which allows for the integration of different types of omics data that have different distribution . However , with the exponential growth of sigle-cell data , there is an urgent need to leverage existing well-characterized datasets as source to ensure relaiable and consistent annotations of target data . Secondly , scTGCN nonlinearly propagates feature information from neighboring cells in the hybrid graph at every layer , which enables it learn the topological cell relationships and consider higher-order relations between cells . Compared to other methods , scTGCN has been shown to achieve higher accuracy in label transfer and can generate visualizations that remove technical noise while retainging the biologically relevant information . Meanwhile , the deep learning model are considered as black boxes [ 55-58 ] because it can be difficult to understand how they arrive at their predictions or decisions . we also provide evidence that scTGCN facilitates the identification of new cell subtypes ( S4 Fig ) , and can help researchers reannotate cell types in scATAC-seq data more accuracy . In brief , scTGCN is a novel transfer learning approach based graph convolutional network that enables the integration and analysis of larger-scale atlas-level single-cell multiomics data . We provide evidence that scTGCN can accurately transfer cell type annotations across dataset from different tissues , species and molecular layers , such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq . Many sophisticated methods , such as the recently developed scIAE , GLOBE , DURIAN and CLEAR provide many flexible frameworks for joint modeling of variation across both modalities , technologies and conditions . Meanwhile , we explore multiple kernels for adapting deep representations , which enhances adaption effectiveness between the mean embeddings of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq . To address this challenge , our model approaches the integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq as a domain adaption problem in transfer learning . Single-cell omics technologies have revolutionized our ability to study the individual components of complex biological systems at a cellular level . One unique feature of scTGCN is that it models regulatory interactions ( S5 and S6 Figs ) explicity across different omics layers . It means that scTGCN can infer regulatory relationships between different types of omics data , even when they are unpaired . The scTGCN framework is a novel end-to-end and hypotheses-free framework for integrating unpaired single-cell multi-omics data with high accuracy and robustness . However , single cell data also be used for other tasks such as trajectory inference , cell-cell interaction analysis and time-series analysis . scTGCN is a method that has several technical advantages over other methods for integration analysis of single-cell data . This helps to improve the accuracy of label transfer and enables scTGCN to capture more complex biological patterns . We assessed the scalability of scTGCN methods on large single-cell datasets generate by Cusanovich et al and Schaum et al .

[ABSTRACT] Our results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs , which , despite lacking a single consensus sequence , retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen . Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 ( AF3 ) modeling , we demonstrate that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin . NLSs are generally short motifs rich in basic amino acids ; however , identifying NLSs can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence . Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3 , resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth . In this study , we characterized the sequence specificity of an essential and conserved NLS in Mcm3 , a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase . Proteins with nuclear localization sequences ( NLSs ) are directed into the cell nucleus through interactions between the NLS and importin proteins .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] For example , similar to other mcm3 mutants with severe growth defects , the contacts mediated by basic residues at P2 and P3 of Mcm3K768R and Mcm3R769A deviate from those of wild-type Mcm3 ( Figs 6C and S7B ) , yet they only show partial growth defects ( Fig 1C ) . An unexpected finding from our study is that the Mcm3SV40-NLS-allR mutant fails to support nuclear import of Mcm3 ( Figs 3 and 4 ) , despite AF3 predicting similar contacts with Kap60 at P2 and P3 ( S7 Fig ) . In contrast , P4 is often occupied by a non-basic residue in monopartite NLSs ; structural studies of the SV40 and c-Myc NLSs suggest that P4 does not interact specifically with importin alpha , thus P4 may be less critical for nuclear import . This study provides additional support of the importance of K767 and K768 in Mcm3 , which are critical for both its nuclear import through interaction with Kap60 and loading onto chromatin through modification by SUMO . Thus , further biophysical studies , including measurements of binding affinity between Mcm3 's NLS and Kap60 , are needed to characterize various mcm3 mutations and gain a deeper understanding of their effects on nuclear import . The existence of Rad52-dependent survivors suggests that an unknown gain-of-function effect caused by these mcm3 mutants may have induced double-stranded DNA breaks in the mcm3 plasmids . Moreover , we have previously shown that K767 and K768 in Mcm3 are redundantly modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier ( SUMO ) , a post-translational modification that can not occur on arginine . Specifically , K768 of Mcm3 and K128 of SV40 occupy P2 , while R769 of Mcm3 and K129 of SV40 occupy P3 with regard to their contacts with Kap60 ; these basic residues are needed for optimal cell growth ( Figs 1 and 2 ) . Additionally , basic residues at P1 and P5 play a supporting role for optimal nuclear localization , likely by contributing to the binding between Kap60 and P2 or P3 of the NLS . However , the accumulation of Rad52-dependent survivors during plasmid shuffling is not explained solely by a loss-of-function defect , as wild-type Mcm3 is present prior to its removal by plasmid shuffling ( Figs 1 and 2 ) . In support of the essential role of P2 and P3 mediated interactions , mutations of Mcm3 at P2 or P3 result in defective nuclear import , reduced chromatin association , and impaired cell growth . In rare cases , even more distant residues can contribute to NLS function , such as K764 of Mcm3 , which is at the minus 3 position relative to P1 . Thus , further studies are needed to understand this defect , which may reveal additional functions of Mcm3 's NLS beyond its role in nuclear import . Second , the basic residue at P2 must be surrounded by at least two basic residues , which can be located at P1 , P3 , P5 , or , in some cases , P4 . For example , variants of Mcm3 's NLS such as Mcm3R771A ( 764KSPKKRQAV772 ) can still localize to the nucleus , as indicated by their normal cell growth ( Fig 1 ) . These findings underscore the structural and functional parallels between the NLS of Mcm3 and SV40 , highlighting the central role of P2 and P3 mediated interactions with Kap60 . Insights gained from this study , along with previously published , well-characterized NLSs [ 4-7 , 11 , 16 ] , suggest several key considerations for analyzing monopartite NLSs . The frequency of these survivors was low and variable , and their improved growth made it impractical to measure using the classical fluctuation analysis . This could be due to the inability of AF3 in distinguishing between basic residues ( e. g. , the primary amine of lysine versus the guanidine group of arginine ) . Although AF3 modeling predicts altered contacts between the NLSs

[ABSTRACT] Results of Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing ( TRIBE ) , co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that a polyA-binding protein ( PABP ) interacting , PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 may be a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules . Taken together , the data lead to a proposal for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation as well as to neurodegeneration . Experiments with transgenic Drosophila indicate that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration , structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both support Atx2-induced cytotoxicity . ATXN2 ( or Atx2 in insects ) can function in translational activation , translational repression , mRNA stability and in the assembly of mRNP-granules , a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) . Previous work has shown that the LSm ( Like-Sm ) domain of Atx2 , which can help stimulate mRNA translation , antagonizes mRNP-granule assembly . Ataxin-2 ( ATXN2 ) is a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II ( SCA2 ) , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and Parkinsonism . Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins . The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Despite the high conservation of the structured domains of Ataxin-2 between human and Drosophila , our data shows that human ATXN2 does not form distinct granules in S2 cells and that this outcome is not dependent on the evolutionary divergence of the structured domains ( panels A-B of V Fig in S1 File ) . The importance of the PAM2 domain in promoting degeneration has been previously observed by experiments showing that heterologous expression of a pathogenic form of human Ataxin-2 lacking its PAM2 domain , but not the full-length form , suppresses cytotoxicity in Drosophila expressing human TDP-43 . The additional observation that Atx2ΔPAM2-ADARcd expression results in a large number of non-native mRNA edits , indicates that the PAM2 : PABP interaction not only selects correct target mRNAs but also prevents Ataxin-2 engagement with incorrect mRNA target regions . This logical sequence of events is consistent with : ( a ) TRIBE data showing a reduced number of edits of native Ataxin-2 target mRNAs by Atx2ΔPAM2-ADARcd ; ( b ) the inability of mini-Atx2ΔPAM2 constructs to associate with SGs ; and ( c ) the aberrant protein composition of granules induced by Atx2ΔPAM2 in S2 cells . Thus , we suggest that in the case of actively translating mRNAs , the Atx2 function is driven by LSm-domain association with LSM12 and translational initiators , and that LSM12 disengages from a translational initiation complex as the mRNA transitions into a repressed state driven by Me31B . Our conclusion that Ataxin2-PAM2 : PABP interactions are involved in the selection of mRNA components of RNP granules is superficially inconsistent with the observation that RNA components of native SGs can be predicted with remarkable accuracy on the basis of mRNA size . Thus , while liquid-liquid transitions mediated by disordered domains could be a shared requirement for the formation of multiple types of mRNP granules , we speculate that each granule type , with distinctive composition , could preferentially support one or other type of proteinopathy . Instead , the TRIBE data address how Atx2-target mRNAs are selected into neuronal mRNP granules that exist in non-stressed cells in vivo , and microscopic studies analyse protein components of mRNP granules formed following Atx2 expression in S2 cells . While polyA tails and PABP are known to support translation and the Ataxin-2 PAM2 domain is involved in targeting the protein to polysomes , existing data do not directly address how Ataxin-2 PAM2 motif interactions contribute to translational activation . First , when Ataxin-2 target mRNAs are not actively translated , then the mRNP through Me31B/DDX6 and PABP may recruit deadenylases to transition into either a translationally dormant or degradative state [ 106 , 109-111 ] . Our experiments provide a much finer grained analysis of the activities of Ataxin-2 , suggesting that the function of the LSm domain should be spared , and that IDR-mediated assembly mechanisms and perhaps PAM2 : PABP interactions should be most usefully targeted by therapeutics . Although such a model aligns with our data , we recognize the absence of experimental evidence in the current study and acknowledge the necessity for extensive and rigorous testing within the life cycle of a single Ataxin-2 target mRNA . The regulation and composition of the former class could well rely extensively on specific protein-protein and protein-mRNA interactions , which may be revealed by future analyses of mechanisms by which such mRNP assemblies are formed in vivo . It is a translational activator of the Drosophila period mRNA , a repressor of several miRNA reporters , a facilitator of neuronal mRNP-granule and stress-granule formation as well as a broad stabilizer of Ataxin-2 associated mRNAs [ 61 , 92 , 100-105 ] . Previous work has shown that Atx2 enhances period mRNA translation through a mechanism requiring LSm-domain interactions with a complex of LSM12 and TYF ( Twenty Four

[ABSTRACT] We showed that this gene becomes progressively dispensable for specification and maintenance of the muscle stem ( MuSC ) cell pool in extraocular muscles ( EOMs ) despite being , together with Myf5 , a major upstream regulator during early development . We demonstrate also that MuSCs in the EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier that those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult , yet EOMs have a significantly higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and post-natally . Overall , our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and brings further insights into the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy . Finally , while limb MuSCs proliferate in the mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy , significantly less MuSCs were present in the EOMs of the mdx mouse model compared to controls , and they were not proliferative . Despite recent efforts , a clear understanding of the cascade of events underlying the emergence and maintenance of the stem cell pool in specific muscle groups remains unresolved and debated . Gene regulatory networks that act upstream of skeletal muscle fate determinants are distinct in different anatomical locations . Moreover , constitutive inactivation of Pax7 postnatally led to a greater loss of MuSCs in the EOMs compared to the limb . Here , we invalidated Pitx2 with multiple Cre-driver mice prenatally , postnatally , and during lineage progression . Thus , we propose a relay between Pitx2 , Myf5 and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Collectively , these observations indicate that EOM specification and differentiation has evolved a unique gene regulatory network where EOM progenitor survival as well as activation of the downstream myogenic factors are dependent on either Myf5 or Mrf4 , and that Pitx2 alone can not override their role . The phenotypes of Pax7 null cells during in vitro activation were somewhat more divergent , depending on the system used ( isolated myoblasts , myofibres , clonogenic assays ) including reduction in the number of myoblasts , increased or reduced differentiation and/or commitment to alternative fates [ 35-38 , 40 , 41 ] . Second , no differences in the number of GFP+ cells per area nor in the proportion of Pitx2+GFP+ cells were observed in the foetal period between control and mutant EOMs , suggesting that factors other than Pitx2 ( and Pax3 ) may ensure the specification of this cell population during embryonic development . While the origin of the discordance with lineage tracing studies is unclear , one possibility could be that MuSCs in the EOMs contribute to myofibres without cell cycle entry and/or the genetic constructs used as Cre drivers are unexpectedly expressed in these myofibres . Finally , some insights into the potential role of Pitx2 in the sparing of EOMs in DMD come from a study showing that in the absence of Pitx2 expression in myofibres of mdx4cv mice , the EOMs succumb to dystrophic changes that are even more severe than those seen in the limb muscles of the same mice . Moreover , expression of Pitx2 in postnatal EOM myogenic cells ( CD34+/Sca1−/CD31−/CD45− lineage ) , which is at higher levels than those in the limb , was reported to contribute to the proliferative and stress resistance properties of these cells in vitro . In this context , a higher number of dying cells per muscle area were observed in Pax7 null EOMs compared to controls at P1 , suggesting that this might be a critical period where compensation by other factors is minimal . While this resulted in a small percentage of centrally nucleated fibres and a more heterogeneous distribution of fibre sizes ( shift towards smaller and larger fibres ) , the resulting phenotype was less severe than when Pitx2 was deleted with a constitutive myofibre Cre driver . Alternatively , it might reflect activation and fusion of the MuSC population without prior entry in the cell cycle given that the number of Pax7+ cells/area was similarly reduced in mdx and mdx ; Pitx2 dKO mice compared to control EOMs . Instead , and like the role of Pax3 in the trunk and limbs , Pitx2 is critically required cell-autonomously to maintain myogenic progenitors in an immature state , ensure their survival until the end of the embryonic period , and to activate the MRFs . It could result from different dynamics of myogenic lineage progression taking place in EOMs and limb muscles during the growth phase in vivo and be related to the deferred differentiation of activated extraocular MuSCs observed in vitro . It would be of interest in future studies to assess whether the downstream targets of Pax7 in MuSCs of cranial and somite origin are similar and to identify complementary transcription factors that confer these distinct MuSC phenotypes . In the present study , we deleted Pitx2 in MuSCs of mdxβgeo mice at an early postnatal stage ( < P7 ) , where considerable fusion is ongoing and thus MuSC-derived myoblasts actively contribute to new myonuclei . We demonstrated herein a temporal requirement for Pitx2 during lineage progression : deletion of this gene in muscle progenitors ( Myf5Cre ) results in the absence of myofibres and upstream cells in the embryo , while deletion in myoblasts ( MyodiCre

[ABSTRACT] With the ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) and its increasing adaptation to humans , several variants of concern ( VOCs ) and variants of interest ( VOIs ) have been identified since late 2020 . In our experiments , we found that this algorithm can accurately fit the reported data of the British Columbia ( BC ) province and its five internal health agencies in Canada . We combine the proposed epidemic model and reported infected data of variants with physical information neural networks ( PINNs ) to develop a novel mechanism called VOCs-informed neural network ( VOCs-INN ) . In this study , we propose an SI1…InR infectious disease model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among the human population . Furthermore , it can simulate observed or unobserved dynamics , infer time-dependent parameters , and enable short-term predictions . These variants may show distinct levels of virulence , antigenicity , and infectivity , which require specific defense and control measures . VOCs-INN performs well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data . The experimental results also reveal variations in the intensity of control strategies implemented across these regions . These include Alpha , Beta , Gamma , Delta , Omicron parent lineage , and other variants .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Firstly , during this period , governments took several intervention measures , such as promoting vaccination , enforcing mandatory mask-wearing in hospitals in April , and lifting the compulsory vaccination requirement for health personnel in July [ 38-42 ] . As we continue to neural network into the potential uses of VOCs-INN in infectious disease modeling , we aim to integrate it with other advanced machine-learning methods to better fit and predict infectious disease data . In our research , we sought to address the complexities of understanding and modeling the transmission dynamics of Variants of Concern ( VOCs ) by integrating an SI1…InR model with neural networks . The flexibility of VOCs-INN allows it to be adapted to various epidemiological scenarios and datasets , offering a robust tool for addressing the complexities and uncertainties associated with epidemic challenges . Furthermore , while the fixed parameters in the model can be adapted as time-varying parameters using VOCs-INN , this method necessitates a larger and more complex parameter network . In conclusion , the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks ( PINNs ) with infectious disease models , particularly through the proposed VOCs-INN approach , represents a significant research contribution . However , it is worth noting that this improvement is not linear , excessively large numbers of interpolation points can lead to increased computational time and complexity . As depicted in Supporting information , an increase in the number of time interpolation points generally enhances the fitting performance and ODE inversion accuracy of VOCs-INN . The alignment of our estimated effective reproduction number in BC province with figures reported in related research articles provides reassurance about the validity of our approach . Another limitation is that the current multi-strain model does not consider factors such as the latency period , associated fatalities , and possible transitions . Our research results indicate that the fitting results of this algorithm align well with real-world data , enabling accurate short-term disease progression predictions . VOCs-INN leverages available observational data and the underlying physical principles governing infectious disease models to capture the time-varying nature of parameters . Moreover , the selection of time interpolation points is another crucial factor that significantly influences the model 's fitting performance and the accuracy of parameter inference . The parameters derived from the neural network are persuasive , and inverse simulations using an ODE solver further validate the accuracy of our estimations . In our research , we empirically adjusted the contraction factor based on the total population of various regions , aiming to bolster numerical stability . It can be clearly seen from the figure that the results significantly improve when the contraction factor is 10-4 under this data . Supporting information illustrates the impact of different contraction factors on the fitting performance and ODE inversion accuracy of our VOCs-INN algorithm . This innovative approach , termed VOCs-INN , allows the analysis of time-varying characteristics of VOCs , such as transmission rates , removal rates , and effective reproduction numbers . This approach enhances the predictive accuracy of the models and provides policymakers with more reliable and scientific frameworks for decision-making . The VOCs-INN algorithm was applied to study the spread of two VOCs in the province of BC and its five constituent regions . During this period , the estimated values of Re , 1 and Re , 2 both showed continuous fluctuations and intersected at three different time points . In the training of neural networks , particularly in regression tasks , the application of a contraction factor is recognized as a fundamental preprocessing step . used a local regression ( LOESS ) model to estimate the time-varying reproduction number range of the Omicron variant as 1 . The observed fluctuations in Re may be a result of this cycle of implementing and then lifting these measures . These limitations provide avenues for future research to

[ABSTRACT] CytoSummaryNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance learning framework , providing an easier-to-apply method for aggregating single-cell feature data than previously published strategies . We introduce CytoSummaryNet : a Deep Sets-based approach that improves mechanism of action prediction by 30-68 % in mean average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset . Interpretability analysis suggests that the model achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells . Image-based cell profiling is a powerful tool that compares perturbed cell populations by measuring thousands of single-cell features and summarizing them into profiles . CytoSummaryNet offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets . Typically a sample is represented by averaging across cells , but this fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations . The approach requires only perturbation labels for training , which are readily available in all cell profiling datasets .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] These findings are consistent with recent studies that emphasize the importance of considering cell context when analyzing phenotypic variance and genetic interactions , supporting the notion that focusing on large , uncrowded cells can provide more accurate and informative data for understanding the effects of perturbations on cell populations . On the other hand , the least salient cells appear to be smaller , more crowded , and tend to contain spots of high-intensity pixels , which may indicate that they are dying , debris , or in some stage of cell division . For mechanism of action retrieval on the primary dataset , CytoSummaryNet achieves 36 % to 60 % better performance than average profiling on hold-out plates created with different experimental protocols than the training plates , provided that these hold-out plates are from the same stain set ( e. g. , Stain2 , Stain3 , etc . Still , not all compounds with the same mechanism of action cluster well , due to factors such as multiple annotated mechanisms , unannotated off-target effects , suboptimal cell type or dose , and technical artifacts . The architecture of CytoSummaryNet holds significant potential for broader applications beyond image-based cell profiling , accommodating tabular , permutation-invariant data and enhancing downstream task performance when applied to processed population-level profiles . These results improve upon the ~20 % gains previously observed using covariance features albeit on a different dataset , and importantly , CytoSummaryNet effectively overcomes the challenge of recomputation after training , making it easier to use . The model 's tendency to amplify existing strong phenotypes and the presence of stronger phenotypic profiles at higher dose points may explain the larger increases in mAP for the 10 μM dose point data . Although CytoSummaryNet can not be directly transferred to out-of-distribution data , it can be readily re-trained on new data , making it a valuable tool for improving results in future cell profiling studies . When applied to cpg0001 training and validation plates , CytoSummaryNet achieves 50 % to 81 % better performance than average profiling , which is affirmed by the 68 % performance increase found for the cpg0004 training data . While this requires retraining for each experiment , it is not a practical limitation because the strategy is self-supervised , requiring only that there be replicates of samples in the experiment for the training step . In conclusion , CytoSummaryNet provides an easier-to-apply and better-performing method for aggregating single-cell image feature data compared to previously published strategies and the average profiling baseline . Recent studies exploring image-derived representations using self-supervised and self-supervised learning could inspire future research on using learned embeddings instead of classical features to enhance model-aggregated profiles . The improved mechanism of action retrieval metrics indicates that CytoSummaryNet 's learned latent representation prioritizes biological signal over technical variance at both the cell and plate levels . 33 μM dose point data was lower than on the seen 10 μM dose point data , it still improved upon average profiling , indicating that CytoSummaryNet can extract some general biological features . When trained on and applied to data within a given experimental condition and batch , CytoSummaryNet creates a better-organized feature space for discerning different compounds than average profiling . This study proposes CytoSummaryNet , a Deep Sets-based model that automatically finds the optimal way to aggregate single-cell population profiles using self-supervised contrastive learning . The model generally outperforms average profiling in both replicate retrieval and mechanism of action retrieval tasks , with the relative performance improvement depending on how CytoSummaryNet is applied . CytoSummaryNet learns an aggregation strategy by receiving single-cell morphological feature input data and providing the aggregated profile as an output . CytoSummaryNet 's learned aggregation method prioritizes the most informative cells , specifically those that are larger and more isolated from other cells . Its versatility makes it valuable for any omics measurements where downstream tasks depend on measuring similarity between profiles . These cells are likely to provide clearer and more reliable information about a compound 's effects ,

[ABSTRACT] To validate the effectiveness of this framework , we apply it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task , a cognitive test in which participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another , often conflicting , aspect . Altered flexibility in these dynamics can lead to impaired cognitive performance , manifesting for instance as difficulties in attention regulation , distraction inhibition , and behavioral adaptation . The ability to solve complex tasks relies on the adaptive changes occurring in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions . Therefore , developing quantitative measures that can directly assess the effort involved in these transitions using neural data is of paramount importance . By utilizing a fully data-driven method , this research opens up fresh perspectives for physiologically describing cognitive effort within the brain . Our findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive effort , thus confirming the framework 's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions . In this study , we propose a framework to associate cognitive effort during the performance of tasks with electroencephalography ( EEG ) activation patterns . The Stroop task is a cognitive test where participants must respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another , often conflicting , aspect . The methodology relies on the identification of discrete dynamical states ( EEG microstates ) and optimal transport theory . Such impairments result in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This suggests that while KL divergence is a useful measure for capturing global shifts between task and resting states , it may lack the sensitivity required to detect more nuanced effects related to cognitive cost when compared to the Schrödinger bridge method . However , this interpretation is in contrast with existing literature , since microstate A is commonly attributed to resting condition , but it should be noted that we used an eyes-open resting state , which likely reduced the power in the alpha band . Therefore , investigating individual differences in microstate transition cost in different groups ( e. g. , strokes ) , or applying it to tasks where the evaluation of cognitive demands is not known , are all interesting avenues to pursue in future research . Although individual topographies have been associated with partial activations or deactivations of canonical resting-state networks and specific spectral bands , the functional and cognitive role of the microstates has not yet been fully established . It is important to mention that in a stochastic linear setting , the Schrödinger bridge control cost is formally equivalent to the `` classical '' control cost ( i. e. , the expectation of the time integral of squared control signal ) , which has a clear physical interpretation . This would involve investigating changes during tasks and determining if the control cost can explain the variation in energy the brain needs to supply for differing cognitive demands . The core foundation of all these models involves a metric that quantifies the amount of effort required for a dynamical system to traverse its state space across diverse conditions . However , its applicability to EEG data holds particular importance due to its widespread usability , cost-effectiveness compared to techniques such as fMRI or MEG , and non-invasiveness compared to intracranial recordings . We observed that the KL divergence tends to be larger for more demanding task conditions , which is consistent with the idea that cognitive load influences the divergence between microstate distributions . Such asymmetric transitions indicate potential fluxes and net flows within the system , which in turn can contribute to the overall production of entropy at a macroscopic level . The latter , by accounting for the transition paths between distributions , appears to capture additional information about cognitive load that is not reflected in KL divergence alone . Indeed , a larger cognitive demand induces a more global alteration in brain activity , which is needed to make functional networks transiently adopt a more efficient but less economical configuration . Notably , certain microstates differentiated between tasks and resting states , while others were specific to incongruent stimuli and modulated by the level of cognitive demand . Several other metrics have already been proposed to quantify the cognitive loads from microstate analysis , such as the entropy rate or the Hurst exponents . Therefore , it is intriguing to consider whether this altered flexibility is associated with an increase in control costs , which our framework could estimate . The trajectories of neural activity can thus be described as discrete transitions between a few metastable attractors , which capture a significant portion of the overall activity variance . To our current knowledge , this is the first application of such a framework to EEG data , thus providing a computational pipeline to quantify cognitive demand in EEG experiments . Confirmation of these hypotheses and further investigation into the microstates can be achieved through source localization , which will be explored in future works . Consequently , it is reasonable to assume that the cognitive cost will be particularly higher for tasks impaired due to specific neural alterations . Additionally , the functional repertoire of macroscopic brain dynamics has been found to be reduced in Amyotrophic
[METHODS] ",,991,98,None,"The ability to solve complex tasks relies on the adaptive changes occurring in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions . Altered flexibility in these dynamics can lead to impaired cognitive performance , manifesting for instance as difficulties in attention regulation , distraction inhibition , and behavioral adaptation . Therefore , developing quantitative measures that can directly assess the effort involved in these transitions using neural data is of paramount importance . In this study , we propose a framework to associate cognitive effort during the performance of tasks with electroencephalography ( EEG ) activation patterns . The methodology relies upon the identification of discrete dynamical states ( EEB microstates ) and optimal transport theory . Such impairments result in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks . Our findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive effort , thus confirming the framework's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions ."

[ABSTRACT] Here , P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein II ( PvDBPII ) probes were generated to detect the development and durability of specific aMBCs , and to demonstrate the capacity of these cells to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections . To address biology and function of P. vivax-specific aMBCs in producing protective antibodies , a single MBC was cultured , and the secreted IgG was tested for binding and inhibition activity . Notably , B cell receptors ( BCRs ) of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs expressed unique IGHV genes , with similar usage of IGHV1-3 , comparable to classical MBCs . The aMBC-derived clones produced antibodies with variable levels of anti-PvDBPII IgG in cultures , and some produced high antibody levels comparable to classical MBC clones . The somatic hypermutation ( SHM ) rate and CDR3 length of VH and Vκ in these two MBC subsets were not significantly different . The accumulation of aMBCs during and following infections might play an important role in producing protective antibodies against malaria . To date , the generation of P. vivax-specific aMBCs and their function in protective humoral immune responses is unknown . PvDBPII-specific aMBCs were elicited during malaria illness , and they persisted through the recovery phase of infections . Among the aMBC clones , A1F12 and B4E11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBPII variants . Together , our findings revealed that P. vivax infections elicited the development and persistence of P. vivax-specific aMBCs . Thus , we focused our attention on the function of aMBCs in producing neutralizing antibodies . Expansion of atypical memory B cells ( aMBCs ) was demonstrated in malaria-exposed individuals .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Lastly , larger sample size for aMBC characterization and its ability in ASC differentiation for neutralizing antibody production , as well as V ( D ) J gene analysis , would better capture the variability of V ( D ) J gene rearrangements and their functional roles in the context of aMBC responses to P. vivax malaria . Fourth , we were unable to assess a possible association between the frequency of P. vivax-specific aMBCs and a subject 's number of infections , as only very few of our subjects had a history of prior infection based on records at malaria clinics . In our study , unique IGHV ( IGHV 3-21 and IGHV5-51 ) and IGKV gene usages ( IGKV2D-29 and IGKV2-29 ) were observed in aMBCs encoding anti-P. vivax neutralizing antibodies ( B4E06 and A1F12 ) , indicating that these aMBC clones were derived from different precursors . In addition to their role as precursors of ASCs , as shown in previous studies and ours , aMBCs have capacity to present antigens by internalizing membrane-associated antigens and express MHC class II and CD11c molecules to interact with T cells . The number of bulk aMBCs ( not antigen-specific ) was high in Malian adults and children with chronic asymptomatic P. falciparum infections , compared to uninfected children , suggesting that the long-term exposure to parasite may drive the expansion of aMBCs . Of note , the phenotypes of P. vivax-specific aMBCs were heterogeneous ( S4 Fig ) , consistent with a previous study in chronic P. falciparum parasite exposure , in which three subsets of aMBCs were identified , but not all developed into ASCs . Expansions of bulk aMBC phenotypes have been demonstrated in malaria-exposed individuals in high P. falciparum malaria transmission settings of Africa [ 20-22 ] , as well as in low P. vivax transmission regions of Brazil and Thailand [ 14 , 26-28 ] . Therefore , further investigation into the factors influencing the development and activation of malaria-specific aMBCs and the correlation of aMBC frequency with malaria protection or reduced severity would be valuable for improving malaria vaccines . The finding of predominant IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses in Nojima cultures did not address the ability of these two MBC subsets to undergo IgG subclass switching following natural malaria infection . To support the capability of MBCs to produce cross-reactive antibodies , single clones of PvDBPII-TH2-MBCs were cultured and then tested for broad binding and inhibition of a panel against PvDBPII allelic variants . Overall , our findings reveal that natural P. vivax infections drive development of antigen-specific aMBCs that express diverse BCR characteristics , possibly connected to different roles in immune responses against P. vivax malaria . Together , our findings highlight a protective role of aMBCs in humoral immune response to malaria by differentiating into ASCs for producing broadly neutralizing antibodies against P. vivax invasion into human erythrocytes . Of note , the accumulation of SHM numbers in aMBCs might be influenced by the age of malaria subjects , as the findings in semi-immune adults showed higher number of SHMs in aMBCs than in children . Third , we lacked an in vitro assay to test inhibitory function of human monoclonal antibody-derived aMBCs which might confirm protective activity of clonal IgG and HuMoAbs . Our evidence was supported by a previous observation reporting that an expansion of atypical MBCs was a normal part of the humoral immune response to both malaria and influenza vaccinations . Notably , one clone ( A1F12 ) exhibited high binding affinity , comparable to that of the classical MBC clone ( B4E11 ) , and produced broadly inhibitory antibodies against the binding of diverse PvDBPII variants to human erythrocytes

[ABSTRACT] We also present a real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank , showing that mr. mash-rss achieves higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits , especially when the data set has smaller sample size . Through simulations , we show that mr. mash-rss is competitive with , and often outperforms , current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in a variety of scenarios that differ in the pattern of effect sharing across phenotypes , the number of phenotypes , the number of causal variants , and the genomic heritability . In this work , we introduce mr. mash-rss , an extension of the mr. mash model that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) and linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) estimates from a reference panel . By using summary data , we achieve the twin goal of increasing the applicability of the mr. mash model to data sets that are not publicly available and making it scalable to biobank-size data . Recently , mr. mash , a flexible and computationally efficient method that models multiple phenotypes jointly and leverages sharing of effects across such phenotypes to improve prediction accuracy , was introduced . However , a drawback of mr. mash is that it requires individual-level data , which are often not publicly available . Polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes has become important in human genetics , especially in the context of precision medicine .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] One way to test the robustness of mr. mash-rss to different sources of model misspecification would be to use truly external summary statistics , possibly from a meta-analysis , and evaluate its performance in an independent cohort . While the theory behind the method assumes the phenotypes to be continuous , it may be possible for mr. mash-rss to be applied to case-control phenotypes , in the same way as methods such LDpred2-auto and SBayesR , which also assume continuous phenotypes . Through an array of simulations and real data analysis using the UK Biobank , we showed that mr. mash-rss is competitive with state-of-the-art univariate and multivariate PGS methods . In addition , in specific cases such as with complete sample non-overlap across phenotypes , some simplifications arise that allow for models like mr. mash-rss to be fitted efficiently . This issue can be overcome by using a grid search and cross-validation approach to select the combination of mixture weights that maximizes prediction accuracy in a test set . Future research is needed to find a more principled way to select hyperparameters that works well with arbitrary patterns of sparsity in the genetic architecture of complex traits . This holds good promise for improving prediction accuracy for phenotypes that are difficult to measure and in samples of individuals of non-European descent , which are usually much smaller . Of note , mr. mash-rss outperformed competing methods in 14 out of 16 blood cell phenotypes , although the magnitude of the improvement varied across phenotypes , from modest to substantial . We were able to ameliorate this problem by obtaining good initial estimates of the mixture weights with mash , which were then refined with a few iterations of mr. mash-rss . For example , when summary statistics come from a meta-analysis of multiple cohorts , sample size is often different among genetic variants , and different biases and noise levels likely affect different cohorts . This highlights that the general mr. mash model can adapt to either more sparse ( e. g. , for gene expression ) or more dense ( e. g. , for complex traits ) genetic architectures . Our work showed that mr. mash-rss is fairly robust to some forms of model misspecification ( i. e. , external LD and sample non-overlap ) . However , mr. mash-rss usually includes a large number of mixture components , which makes the grid search and cross-validation approach not feasible . Another limitation of mr. mash-rss is that it requires the summary statistics to be computed on the same samples for each phenotype . In this work , we have introduced mr. mash-rss , the summary data version of a recently developed empirical Bayes multivariate multiple regression method . The problem stems from the update of the hyperparameters ( the mixture weights , in particular ) by maximization of the ELBO , which gets trapped in sub-optimal local optima . Additionally , mr. mash-rss addresses two important limitations of mr. mash -the need for individual-level data and the lack of scalability to biobank-size data . A limitation of mr. mash-rss is that it does not perform as well for very polygenic phenotypes as highlighted by the second data application . Dealing with arbitrary patterns of missing data in multivariate models is not a trivial problem and is an area where more research is needed . We also showed that the improvement in prediction accuracy from using mr. mash-rss increased substantially with a smaller sample size . Like mr. mash , mr. mash-rss enjoys ( 1 ) the ability to learn patterns of effect sharing across phenotypes ; ( 2 ) the ability to model dozens of phenotypes jointly ; ( 3 ) computational efficiency . In fact , recent work has shown that imputing

[ABSTRACT] In this study , we propose a novel modelling framework integrating the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models , by introducing a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles . Subsequently , we project the attack rate and peak of new infections for the first Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the dynamic zero-COVID policy . Accurate prediction of epidemics is pivotal for making well-informed decisions for the control of infectious diseases , but addressing heterogeneity in the system poses a challenge . Data from a COVID Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the UDE model using deep learning methods and to calibrate the mechanistic model using MCMC methods . We consider that this study lays the groundwork for the development of a new class of models and new insights for modelling heterogeneity . 36 % of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from ~30 days to ~70 days , also aligning with the real case . Simultaneously , we pre-set a specific form for the recruitment rate and develop a mechanistic model . A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations ( UDE ) model . Our simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in the susceptibles decreases herd immunity for ~37 . Our projections indicate an attack rate and a peak of new infections of 80 . 17 % of the population , respectively , compared with the homogeneous model 's projections of 99 . 6 % improvement in the prediction accuracy based on the actual data . 78 % , thus providing an 18 . 97 % and 32 . 06 % and 3 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Secondly , there is also another kind of heterogeneity ( such as the age-structure of the population ) which is ignored in the current study and how the different forms of heterogeneity reciprocally affect the transmission dynamics of infectious disease would be a very interesting issue . The straightforward approach taken in our framework not only enhances its practical utility but also encourages further exploration and refinement , thereby contributing to the advancement of understanding and modelling infectious disease dynamics with spatio-temporal heterogeneity . Firstly , we only used one time-series of the epidemic data to train or calibrate the models , hence we appeal for the collection of more spatial data for calibrating our models , which would definitely help to increase the robustness of the results . This phenomenon also suggests the possibility that the diffusion of infections may lead to multiple instances of herd immunity , as the increased recruitment rate can cause the effective reproduction number to rise and exceed the threshold again . Finally , when we tried to generate the time series of the numbers of daily new infections , the frequency distribution of the time-interval from infection to report seems , potentially , to be bimodal , while our pre-set distributions were not bimodal . However , their utility in conducting quantitative analyses of epidemic outbreaks , grounded in real-world data , is impeded by the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of these model structures in terms of the mechanistic modelling framework . The objective is to render feasible the projection of key epidemic indices and enhance the overall performance of mathematical models under the influence of spatio-temporal heterogeneity , facilitating a more robust understanding of infectious disease dynamics . Moreover , this modelling structure opens the door to conducting more theoretical studies aimed at qualitatively analyzing the impact of heterogeneity on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and exploring optimal control strategies . That is , a higher diffusion speed and larger transmission rate result in an increased recruitment rate of susceptibles , consequently leading to a higher attack rate , a peak in daily new infections , and a larger herd immunity , as can be intuitively seen in Fig 6 . The potential reason for this is that the reported numbers of infected cases suddenly rose during the decreasing phase of the epidemic wave ( see Fig 4 for details ) , resulting in the increase of the recruitment rate of the susceptible population . Employing the cutting-edge technology of deep learning , we trained our Universal Differential Equation ( UDE ) model and utilized the Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) method for calibrating the underlying mechanisms . Consequently , the inclusion of heterogeneity becomes crucial for accurately estimating the requirements for medical resource preparation during large-scale outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases , as well as determining the necessary vaccination coverage . In the light of these considerations , we contend that this study can serve as a foundation for the development and theoretical analysis of a class of models within the realm of modelling the heterogeneity of susceptible populations . This highlights the importance of incorporating our modelling method into various compartmental modelling frameworks to enhance the prediction accuracy of epidemic models , ultimately improving decision-making in the control of infectious diseases . However , extending our modelling framework to incorporate the impact of demographic changes on the recruitment process of susceptibles , and subsequently on transmission dynamics , presents a very interesting topic for future research . Note that the outcomes of our study underscore that peak size , final size , and herd immunity in real-world scenarios are notably smaller than predictions derived from homogeneous models .

[ABSTRACT] Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its postsynaptic neuron , we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment . To show this , we developed a mathematical framework , in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain , dynamic environment . This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is being updated by a synaptic learning rule , which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms . In addition , this approach entails that a synapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential . Here we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron . Hereby , synapses coordinate themselves to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations . Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising . Synapses in the brain are highly noisy , which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In summary , we have presented a synapse-centric account of PP that views synapses as agents that interact with their post-synaptic neuron much like an organism interacts with its environment . In contrast to this prior work , our model synapses use only local information and yields triplet STDP dynamics which can be directly tested against experiments . Our results complement previous applications of PP on the system and network level , and demonstrates that manifestations of PP can be identified even on the smallest scales of brain function . The emergent learning algorithm is fully event-based , i. e. , computation only takes place when pre- and post-synaptic spikes arrive at the synapses . The emerging SPP learning rule is qualitatively consistent with experimentally observed synaptic mechanisms while being analytically tractable . The model is therefore very well suited for event-based neural simulation and brain-inspired hardware .

[ABSTRACT] We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis ( LCOA ) achieved the largest health gain-∼8 % reduction in disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario-by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments . By mechanistically modelling-and calibrating to extensive , country-specific data-the incidence of disease , health-seeking behaviour , and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health available , we were able to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for the country . Unlike the LCOA-based HBP , this approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year- to-year basis , and a 5 % reduction in DALYs over the whole period , which suggests an approach based upon patient characteristics might prove beneficial in the future . In this work , we propose the individual-based Thanzi La Onse ( TLO ) model as a uniquely-tailored tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs while addressing these limitations . Efforts to achieve this are often framed through the lens of `` health benefits packages '' ( HBPs ) , which seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision . An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population-health outcomes given the available health system capacity . Analytic approaches widely used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process however have limitations . This HBP however incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation . Other feasible approaches to prioritisation were assessed , including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics , rather than service type .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We have shown that the TLO simulation provides a unique tool with which to test HBPs designed specifically for Malawi , providing detailed evaluations on the health gains that can be achieved through the relative prioritisation of services given realistic constraints in available human resources for health while addressing limitations in other analytic methods commonly used to weigh evidence for different interventions . 4 ) which either reflect current preferences in the prioritisation of services among policy-makers and external funding agents ( RMNCH , VP , and CMD policies ) , mirror current analytical tools and approaches to prioritise health interventions ( HSSP-III HBP or LCOA ) , or implement new strategies of prioritisation based on patient characteristics rather than service type ( CV policy ) . Our TLO-based approach , however , further allows us to evaluate how the relative performance of the policies would change were health-seeking and clinical practices to be significantly improved , and hence assess how much the outcome of specific policies is limited not by the design of the policies themselves , but by other factors related to the practical application of those policies . Although considerations of equity were not included in the analysis at this stage , they are already included in the TLO model , and will be the focus of later studies . We found that : The evaluation of the policies considered accounted for imperfect clinical practices motivated by country-specific data , as well as the probability of consumables stock-outs . The model is further being expanded to include a full costing analysis for the interventions considered , which will result in a more comprehensive analysis . Using the TLO simulation , we evaluated a number of resource allocation strategies for Malawi ( summarised in section 2 . In our evaluation , we assumed that prioritisation policies are enforced consistently for a 20-year period . These will be addressed in future work .

[ABSTRACT] Here , we employ Oligopaint DNA FISH to investigate mechanisms of meiotic homolog pairing and chromosome segregation in the holocentric pantry moth , Plodia interpunctella , and compare our findings to new and previous studies in the silkworm moth , Bombyx mori , which diverged from P. interpunctella over 100 million years ago . Surprisingly , in both species we find that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromosomes regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent . Our studies here highlight the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems , as employing novel organisms can lead to the discovery of novel biology . These findings challenge the classical view of segregation where paired , poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I . Yet , the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosomal events such as homolog pairing and chromosome segregation are not fully understood in many species . However , unlike the telomere-oriented chromosome segregation mechanism observed in Bombyx , Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple different ways at metaphase I . We find that pairing in both Bombyx and Plodia spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends . Despite this , we find clear end-on microtubule attachments and not lateral microtubule attachments co-orienting these separated kinetochores . Precise regulation of chromosome dynamics in the germline is essential for reproductive success across species . Additionally , sister kinetochores do not seem to be paired in these species . Additionally , both species form rod shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I . Instead , four distinct kinetochores are easily observed at metaphase I .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The fact that we do not observe a strong correlation between chromosome length and center-oriented bivalents would , indeed , support a model where these center-oriented bivalents are not exclusively forming by double crossovers ( which we would expect to be more frequent for longer chromosomes ) . In this scenario , the telomere-oriented configuration would be a precursor to the center-oriented configuration , which is then achieved by the central kinetochore domains being pulled toward the poles via the meiotic spindle , flipping the homologs and resulting in a structure with both arm domains facing each other at the metaphase I plate . Since CENP-T shows low retention rates at chromosome regions with active gene expression in mitotic cells , we propose that active transcription at telomere-proximal regions in meiosis ( which may or may not facilitate homolog recognition ) could lead to the loss of CENP-T from the distal regions of chromosomes . While harboring unpaired sister kinetochores could increase the chances of aneuploidy , it may allow metaphase I bivalents to switch between homologs being bi-oriented or sisters being bi-oriented in a non-hybrid or hybrid situation , respectively , to maintain optimal fertility in different scenarios . While it seems most likely to us that the center-oriented bivalents observed at metaphase I represent the homologs being physically linked at both chromosome ends , it is also possible that these structures are instead a transient state . Together , our data suggest that mechanisms of homolog recognition and pairing initiation are conserved across Lepidoptera and possibly more broadly across species , as transcription-related processes have been linked to pairing from yeast to mammals . Another possibility is that homologs in Plodia remain linked at metaphase I by non-crossover mechanisms , such as those that have been reported in Drosophila males , Bombyx females , and C. elegans [ 48 , 68-74 ] . For example , the telomere-oriented bivalents observed for all Bombyx and some Plodia chromosomes could be the result of a single distal CO , consistent with studies suggesting only a single CO occurs per chromosome in Lepidoptera [ 64-66 ] . In this model , COs would largely occur within the distal arm regions of the chromosome , away from this newly defined `` centromere '' , which is consistent with the various structures we observed at metaphase I . How gene density may influence other early meiotic events such as the formation of double-strand breaks , and whether breaks are actually required for pairing in Plodia spermatogenesis , are areas of ongoing investigation . Indeed , transcription has been associated with meiotic pairing in other species , such as S. pombe , and with somatic pairing in species from flies to humans [ 51-54 ] , suggesting that pairing may be regulated by similar mechanisms across species . However , as we observe both center- and telomere-oriented bivalent structures already in diakinesis ( S3A and S3B Fig ) , and they persist through alignment at metaphase I ( Figs 3 and 4 ) , we find this is possibility unlikely . Additionally , early anaphase I cells from Bombyx testes still largely show telomere-oriented chromosomes , and it is not until late anaphase that these bivalents `` flip '' to a center-outward configuration ( S7 Fig ) . Conversely , our observation of some center-oriented bivalents with both chromosome arms remaining linked at the center of the metaphase I plate in Plodia would suggest the formation of two COs between these homologs . However , lineage-specific adaptations to the holocentric structure result in unique mechanisms of chromosome segregation between species , with moths limiting kinetochore formation to the center of chromosomes during spermatogenesis . The arm-like region of
[METHODS] ",,971,97,None,"Meiosis is a process of chromosome segregation in the germline , which is essential for reproductive success across species . However , the mechanisms underlying meiotic events such as homolog pairing and chromosomal segregations are not fully understood in many species , as employing novel organisms can lead to the discovery of novel biology . Here , we employ Oligopaint DNA FISH to investigate mechanisms of meiothelial homolog pair and cell division in the holocentric pantry moth , Plodia interpunctella , and compare our findings to new and previous studies in the silkworm moth Bombyx mori , that diverged from P . interpuncktella over 100 million years ago . Surprisingly , in both species we find that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromatids regardless of where chromatosome centers are located in the bivalent . Additionally , sister kinetochore domains do not seem to be paired in these species ; instead , four distinct kientochores are easily observed at metaphase I . Our findings suggest that homolog recognition and pairing initiation are conserved across Lepidoptera and possibly more broadly across species as transcription-related ."

[ABSTRACT] We further show that low-dose aspirin treatment , which is known to affect NG2-glia , or changes in gut microbiota , rescue both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants . Our study highlights a central role of NG2-glia for ME function during a transitional period of post-natal development and indicates their sensitivity to extrinsic signals . We demonstrate here that the absence of Sox3 predominantly affects the ME with phenotypes that first occur in juvenile animals , despite the embryonic onset of SOX3 expression . We and others previously showed that mutations and duplications affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox3 result in hypopituitarism , and this is likely of hypothalamic origin . The median eminence ( ME ) , located at the base of the hypothalamus , is an essential centre of information exchange between the brain and the pituitary . In the pituitary , reduction in hormone levels correlates with a lack of endocrine cell maturation . In parallel , ME NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential are affected .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While we do not yet know if NG2-glia are required for pituitary hypophysiotropic neuron integrity , it is worth noting that hypopituitarism occurs in both humans and rats after cranial irradiation where NG2-glia may be the most sensitive cell type given their high rate of proliferation compared to other cell types in the brain . It is worth noting that the predominant phylum of gut microbiota at NIMR were Gram negative Bacteroidetes , which possess a unique diaminopimelate-containing GlcNAc-MurNAc tripeptide muropeptide ( GM-TriDAP ) sensed by NOD1 , while the most abundant phyla at the Crick are Gram-positive Firmicutes carrying the GlcNAc-MurNAc dipeptide ( GM-Di ) , which can be sensed by both NOD1 and NOD2 [ 85-87 ] . In this respect , a 'weaning reaction ' to microbiota has been described , and while this was associated with development of the immune system and protection against immunopathologies , gut bacterial cell wall components , muropeptides , can also be sensed directly via Nod1 and Nod2 receptors on cells in the brain , including the hypothalamus . We can not exclude an additional role for tanycytes , whose maintenance is also affected in Sox3 mutants , however , hypothalamic stem cells do not normally give rise to NG2-glia in adult mice ; it is therefore unlikely that the reduction in the number of ME NG2-glia in Sox3 mutants is secondary to the proliferation defect of the stem cells . In contrast , low dose aspirin increases differentiation rather than proliferation of cultured NG2-glia by inhibiting Wnt signalling , but the situation may be different in vivo , where the effects of aspirin might also be mediated by other cells within or outside the ME . A further indication that the hypopituitarism seen in the Sox3 mutants is likely due to a deficiency of NG2-glia comes from the restoration of both pituitary function and proliferation of NG2-glia with low dose aspirin , while differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes is still impaired . Consequently , because of the potential link between reduced NG2-glia after irradiation and hypopituitarism , it is of interest to explore whether low dose aspirin treatment and/or changes in microbiota composition could have rescuing effects in this context too . Detailed analyses would be needed to determine whether inhibition of COX1 activities in microglia by aspirin is responsible for the restoration of NG2-glia proliferation in Sox3 mutants or if COX-independent mechanisms are also relevant . Although the related factor SOX2 , with which it is known to show functional redundancy , is expressed throughout the neuroepithelium , the absence of SOX3 does have consequences at this stage with respect to induction of the pituitary and its morphological development . This is also reflected in neurosphere cultures derived from the hypothalamus , where those from Sox3-/Y mice post-weaning fail to be maintained for more than a few passages in contrast to cultures initiated at earlier stages or from other neurogenic niches at any stage . Indeed , a direct role for NG2-glia in the ME for neuronal function has already been indicated , whereby their ablation is associated with obesity attributed to degeneration of the dendritic processes of arcuate nucleus leptin receptor neurons . Tancytes are directly involved in regulating Gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone and Thyrotropin-releasing hormone release into the blood stream at the ME level ( and for review : ) and it is possible that SOX3 plays a role in this , as well as in their self-renewal as we reveal by proliferation and neurosphere assays . To confirm the contribution of the microbiome to the Sox3 null phenotype , experiments would have to be performed in more rigorous settings in which mice under germ-free conditions would be faecal transplanted with either NIMR or Crick materials . Alternatively , rather than just being precursors of oligodendrocytes , NG2-glia have other roles that involve crosstalk with neurons , astrocytes and microglia ( for review , see ) , all of which are found within the ME . While we have not formally tested the effect

To address how CED-12/CED-5 could have two opposing effects on F-actin , during corpse engulfment and cell migration , we investigated if CED-12 harbors GAP ( GTPase Activating Protein ) functions . Mutating Serine-Arginine in CED-5/DOCK predicted to bind and stabilize Rac1 for catalysis , resulted in loss of both ventral enclosure and corpse engulfment . Thus , we propose CED-5/CED-12 support the cycling of multiple GTPases , by using distinct domains , to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation . However , we need to identify the GEF , or Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor , that activates CED-10/Rac1 during embryonic cell migrations . It is believed that CED-5/CED-12 powers cellular movements of corpse engulfment and DTC migration by promoting F-actin formation . Mutating a candidate catalytic Arginine in the CED-12 GAP region ( R537A ) altered the epidermal cell migration function , and not the corpse engulfment function . Our studies of C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis identified the GTPase CED-10/Rac1 as an essential activator of F-actin . CED-5/CED-12 definitely support embryonic migrations , since their loss led to embryos that died due to failed epidermal cell migrations . However , CED-5/CED-12 inhibited F-actin in the migrating epidermis , the opposite of what was expected for a CED-10 GEF . Understanding the proteins that regulate F-actin is important , since these proteins are mis-regulated in diseases like cancer . Genetic and expression studies strongly support that the GAP function likely acts on different GTPases . Therefore , we tested if CED-5/CED-12 was involved in embryonic migrations , and got a contradictory result . We interfered with GEF function by interfering with CED-5 's ability to bind Rac1/CED-10 . A candidate GAP region in CED-12 faces away from the CED-5 GEF catalytic region . Coordinated activation and inhibition of F-actin supports the movements of morphogenesis . [ INTRODUCTION ] [ RESULTS ] [ DISCUSSION ] Our findings here strongly support that the embryonic lethality of ced-12 , also seen in partner protein ced-5 , is due to failure to regulate F-actin during embryonic cell migrations , resulting in increased F-actin , altered dynamics and faster epidermal enclosure as the cells increase their migration rate . Our results suggest that at these earliest stages of embryonic development , when oocytes are being fertilized , the branched actin regulators CED-5/CED-12 , CED-10 and WAVE complex components , are required so that embryos are the correct length and shape , by promoting the correct levels of RHO-1 activity . To further investigate which GTPases are targets of the proposed GEF and GAP functions of CED-5/CED-12 , it may be possible to test binding of the purified CED-5/CED-12 complex to GTP and GDP loaded versions of the three main GTPases , as we and others have done . When we can image endogenous CED-12 in live animals , one prediction is that there will be different populations of CED-12 , carrying out distinct functions , both promoting and inhibiting F-actin , in different parts of the epidermal cells . Null mutations in CED-5 or CED-12 have consistently higher levels of F-actin in the migrating epidermal cells , and this correlated with faster migrations , and increased dynamics in the protrusions and retractions at the edge of leading cells ( Figs 1 and 2 ) . Since the effect of mutating the CED-12 GAP function includes rescuing embryonic lethality ( Fig 7B ) , this result suggests that excess levels of CDC-42 and RHO-1 are detrimental for embryonic epidermal morphogenesis . We identified a clear GAP domain within CED-12 , that aligned to the GAP in ELMODs , and a related region in ELMOs , which do not contain the catalytic Arginine needed for GAP function ( Figs 5A and S1A ) . This outward orientation of R537 actually increases the interactions that CED-12 can make , since the GAP motif is available in both open and closed conformations to interact with other proteins . As expected , this created structural interference with the key residue on CED-5/DOCK2 that needs to interact with the ring residue of the GTPase ( Rac1/CED-10 ( W56 ) , CDC-42 ( F56 ) and RHO-1 ( W58 ) ( S1C Fig ) . The discovery of CED-12 was impactful , since it identified a molecule , conserved across phyla , that affected cell migrations and cell engulfment of apoptotic corpses [ 13-16 ] ( The cell migration defects referred to the larval migrations of the distal tip cell ( DTC ) . These differences suggest two conclusions : ( 1 ) there is likely a second pathway , in addition to CED-5/CED-12 , that regulates epidermal F-actin during this migration and ( 2 ) too much F-actin in the epidermal cells disrupts migrations . Mutations in the rho-1 pathway , like filamin , or the Rho GAP SPV-1 lead to embryos that are round , so too much or too little actomyosin contractility in the spermatheca can alter egg shape , including producing round embryos . The ced-5 and ced-12 embryonic phenotype , with fully penetrant increased F-actin ( 100 % of the embryos show elevated F-actin ) and partially penetrant embryonic lethality ( Figs 1 and 6 and Table 1 ) has been shown for other mutations in proteins that regulate actin . However , increased epidermal F-actin correlated with increased leading edge membrane dynamics ( Fig 2C ) , suggesting excess [",,1024,80,Missing abstract section|Missing discussion section,"In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , embryonic epidermal morphogenesis is controlled by a two-component GTPase , CED-5/CED-12 .

[ABSTRACT] This could be achieved by a hierarchical organization of temporal processing through intrinsic mechanisms ( e. g. , recurrent coupling or adaptation ) , but recent evidence from spike recordings of the rodent visual system seems to conflict with this hypothesis . Here , we used an optimized information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to show that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation , while information-theoretic predictability decreases . Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas , while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code . Moreover , intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy , whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent . We could reproduce these observations in a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input . A core challenge for the brain is to process information across various timescales .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our analysis of data from different stimulus conditions and recurrent network models further indicated that the gradients in timescales are supported by stimulus-independent , network-intrinsic mechanisms , such as an increasing recurrence along the anatomical hierarchy . In contrast , the stimulus-dependent decrease in predictability is in agreement with efficient coding and the observed increase in adaptation in rodents , as well as a formation of increasingly invariant , high-level visual representations , and might constitute another hallmark of hierarchical temporal processing in mammals . Until now it has remained open whether single sensory pathways in cortex show a hierarchical organization of temporal processing , especially in rodents , where cortex exhibits less cognitive processing and fewer levels of abstractions compared to primates . Here , we found that the visual pathway in mouse cortex indeed shows signatures of such a hierarchy in the form of a gradual increase in correlation and information timescales , and a decrease in predictability along the anatomical hierarchy .

[ABSTRACT] The study goal was to use epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn through which the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS , including direct and indirect waves , could be investigated . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) is a non-invasive , FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications , but the neural circuits that are engaged during TMS are still poorly understood . Moreover , activation of both afferents to the motor cortex as well as specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves , and the results were interpreted to propose the cortical origins of afferents that may give rise to certain I-waves . The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to both identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation . Single wave preference could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and L5 pyramidal tract neurons ( PTNs ) . Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to TMS , and therefore a new opportunity to model neural circuit dynamics . The results support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons . An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways , and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways . For these activations , the total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave . Finally , there were multiple neuron type activations that could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave . Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] To generalize , the results of the structural analysis suggest that if the generator of a signal within a network is known , and the connection probabilities and conduction delays of the network are known , then the network elements that preferentially contribute to singular peaks of a system 's impulse response can be screened by performing the following : for each neuron type 1 ) identify all possible paths from the neuron type to the signal generator , 2 ) compute the ratios of the log of the connection probability between the most highly connected path and the remaining paths normalized by the sum of all log probabilities , and 3 ) obtain the latency of effect for the most highly connected path . The secondary analysis revealed that the anatomical structure of the network , i. e. , the wiring diagram and conduction latencies that resulted from the anatomical constraints , were then important for predicting the circuit activations that give rise to specific I-waves with both the recruitment of afferents to L2/3 and L6 IT cells being possible mechanisms . Therefore , the results can not be generalized to explain effects to conditions beyond the experimental data it was optimized to reproduce , i. e. , the results are only valid for coil orientations that induce an electric field in the posterior-anterior direction using a monophasic pulse . The sensitivity analysis predicted that activation of afferents for specific neuron types could have a preferential effect on specific I-waves , so the results of the sensitivity analysis were compared to the laminar distribution of terminals of corticocortical afferents in mouse motor cortex to predict the anatomical origin of afferents with preferential I-wave effects . Additionally , the sensitivity analysis showed that the I2-wave and I3-waves were most sensitive to activation of inhibitory neurons ( Fig 5G ) , and this is consistent with experimental findings that show GABAA agonists affect later I-waves [ 15-17 ] . Single unit activity from a similar ICMS study that stimulated and recorded from M1 found minimal , sparse spiking within the time window relevant for I-waves and supports that single L5 PTNs contribute to few I-waves , if at all . In this work , the sensitivity analysis supported one of the major hypotheses concerning I-wave generation : I-waves are recruited transsynaptically through separate circuits that impinge onto L5 PTNs and involve both excitatory and inhibitory neurons . The small dataset allowed for more rapid model development due to fewer optimization constraints , and the methods established in this work can be applied in the future to extended data from more subjects and more recordings within subject . The axon terminal distributions for lateral and anterior ventral thalamus within motor cortex were also characterized , but prior studies showed that lesions in those areas do not affect I-wave generation . Though STP is engaged in response to paired-pulse stimuli , it is unknown the degree to which the series of transsynaptic activations resulting from a single pulse also contribute to I-wave , and remains an open question . Afferents originating from the secondary ( supplementary ) motor area ( M2 ) have a high density of terminals in the deep portion of L5 where the somata of L5 PTNs lie , and activation of M2 afferents may be a candidate for I1-wave generation . Understanding the circuit organization of the target neural system and its inherent conduction latencies can be used to screen for important pathways that are recruited and contribute to an acute evoked response .

[ABSTRACT] Using data from genome-wide association studies , we showed spatial clustering of risk variants across four HDCs ( breast , endometrial , ovarian and prostate cancers ) , contrasting with genetically uncorrelated traits . Known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes , implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or facilitate the repurposing of existing treatments for HDC . Integrating GWAS data , epigenomic profiling and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models , we annotated 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions . Additionally , we pinpointed lncRNAs as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factors motifs , suggesting regulatory mechanisms . These targets were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census , but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles . We identified 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome , defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs : two regions contained risk variants for all four HDCs , 13 for three HDCs and 28 for two HDCs . Our approach provides a framework for identifying common target genes driving complex traits and enhances understanding of HDC susceptibility . Hormone-dependent cancers ( HDCs ) share several risk factors , suggesting a common aetiology .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] We first annotated each mHDCR region with protein-coding genes from GENCODE ( v37 basic ) and intersected all candidate variants with genomic annotations ( exons , promoters defined as transcription start site ( TSS ) ± 2 kb and intronic and intergenic regions ; S1A Fig ) . Furthermore , we focused on identifying protein-coding genes , but studies by ourselves ( and others ) show that long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) are also transcribed from cancer risk regions and can have important roles in tumorigenesis [ 37-41 ] . Some are known pleiotropic cancer genes ( e. g MYC , CCND1 ; S4 Fig ) supporting the validity of our approach , but many have only been statistically and/or functionally associated with individual HDCs and may represent new mHDCR genes . To assess whether HDC variants were more frequently positioned together than would be expected by chance , we defined `` clusters '' when variants associated with two or more HDCs were co-localized within the same 100 kb window . These traits showed similar genomic distributions to randomly generated background regions ( Fig 1A ) , which provided support that HDC risk regions co-localize in the genome and that these regions likely contain pleiotropic variants and common target genes . The candidate mHDCR gene list was enriched for known cancer genes and drug targets , which provides support that other , less-well-characterized genes at mHDCR regions may play important roles in HDC development . Here we show that NWD1 , located ~580 kb from ABHD8 , has distal ovarian and prostate cancer variants , some of which fall in regulatory elements that loop to and may regulate the NWD1 promoter ( Fig 4D ) . Indeed , when we intersected the HDC risk variants with annotated lncRNAs at the 44 mHDCR regions , we identified 21 lncRNAs associated with two or more HDCs , including two cancer-related lncRNAs that were the only mHDCR targets identified at regions 27 and 32 ( S5 Fig ) . For example , Lawrenson et al used 3D mapping and reporter assays to show that breast and ovarian cancer risk variants at 19p13 influence distal enhancers , which in turn regulate ABHD8 expression . An initial analysis identified 17 candidate mHDCR genes ( across 11 mHDCR regions ) that contain exonic , promoter or potential splicing variants associated with two or more HDCs ( Figs 2B and S1C and S5 Table ) . Most of the identified HDC risk variants are noncoding ( S1A Fig ; ~94 % ) , and a subset of these will map to DNA regulatory elements that modulate gene transcription through long-range chromatin interactions . Compared to ovarian and endometrial cancers , the significantly larger sample sizes resulted in most breast and prostate mHDCR regions containing at least three independent signals per cancer type ( Fig 1E ) . Using an interaction score threshold ( CHiCAGO score ≥ 5 ) we detected 8-19 , 000 high-confidence interactions per cell type across the 44 mHDCR regions with strong correlation between replicates ( Figs 3B and S2B ) . Twenty-five genes had evidence of cell-type-specific regulatory activity based on ChromHMM data from the corresponding cell types ( Fig 4A and S5 Table ) , and 19 were supported by evidence from a single cancer type ( S5 Table ) . From this dataset , we extracted two key metrics : the RegulomeDB ranking , where a score of 1 indicates stronger supporting evidence for regulatory function and probability scores , where a score of 1 indicates higher likelihood that a variant is regulatory ( S4 Table ) . Combined with future research that investigates functional mechanisms , our results may serve to redirect efforts to more promising targets for new drugs or allow drug repurposing for HDC treatment .

[ABSTRACT] We suggest that elements located 10-49 kb upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play an important role in the regulation of the canine genes and that deletion of these elements is a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs . Our results suggest that distant variants upstream of IL21 could also be important for human autoimmune diseases that have been found to be associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region . Next Generation Sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment , located 10 kb upstream of the neighbouring interleukin genes IL21 and IL2 . Leukocytes of affected , untreated dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpress IL21 and IL2 upon stimulation with mitogens . A genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls indicated the involvement of a region on chromosome CFA19 ( p = 4 . Postulating causality , the penetrance of the disease phenotype was estimated at 10-20 % for homozygous dogs and 0 . The familial occurrence of the disease were suggestive of an inherited cause .

According to data in TADKB , the two genes are located on the same topologically associating domains ( TADs ) in diverse human cell lines , suggesting their expression could be coordinated . It will be interesting to learn whether human cases of autoimmune diseases that map to the IL21/IL2 locus carry specific variants in the region syntenic to the 39 kb deletion . Meanwhile , the PCR assay to genotype the deletion allele in Kooiker dogs provides a tool for breeders to prevent the birth of high risk dogs and reduce the incidence of polymyositis in the breed . We postulated that the deletion affects the regulation of one or both of the adjacent interleukin genes IL21 and IL2 , thereby increasing the risk for superfluous inflammatory reactions . By targeted deletion of smaller DNA fragments in a wild-type cell line , capable of IL21 expression in response to stimulation , these elements could be identified . Follow-up experiments should be directed to fine-mapping of the DNA elements in the 39 kb fragment that are involved in the expression of IL21 . Genome-wide association studies established a possible role of the IL21/IL2 region in the human autoimmune diseases RA , SLE , type 1 DM , and SS . Indeed , the expression of both genes is enhanced strongly in PBMCs from untreated PM affected Kooiker dogs that are homozygous for the deletion . The deletion of 20 kb at a distance of 2 , 7 kb from IRGM leads to up- or downregulation of the gene , depending on the cell type . The expression study needs to be replicated in a larger cohort to confirm the effect of the 39 kb deletion on the regulation of the genes . Kooiker dogs presented an autoimmune myopathy that we could analyze genetically because of the homogeneous makeup of the breed population . Our results indicate that these variants may be found at a distance of at least 10 kb upstream of the IL21 gene . The role of the interleukin encoded by the neighboring gene IL2 in autoimmunity seems to be the opposite of that of IL-21 . The interleukin IL-2 has been investigated as a therapeutic agent in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases with promising results . With approximately 15 , 000 Kooiker dogs from which the cases were recruited , and a deletion allele frequency of 0 . It is very well possible that other inherited factors modify the risk of PM in Kooiker dogs . Interestingly , a similarly sized deletion upstream of IRGM in humans has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease 19 ( Crohn disease 19 ) . Leukocytes from a control dog that did not have the deletion showed little change of expression of the genes . Specifically , expression of the IL21 gene was found to be upregulated in patients with PM and dermatomyositis . It is also possible that the two isolated cases share yet unknown risk factors with other cases . Not overexpression but Il2 knockout leads to a disrupted immune response and predisposition to inflammatory bowel disease . We conclude that dysregulation of IL21 expression is the most likely cause of PM in Kooiker dogs . However , the responsible DNA element and its function in inflammatory processes are yet to be discovered . The deleted region does not contain protein-coding exons according to the recent genome annotation ( UU_Cfam_GSD_1 . We linked the disease to a deletion of a DNA region of

Postulating causality , the penetrance to the disease phenotype was estimated at 10–20% for homozygous dogs and 0 . 5–20% for heterozygously dogs . Our results suggest that elements located 10-49 kb upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play an important role in the regulation of the canine genes and that deletion of these elements may be a risk factor for polymyonotic diseases ."

Lastly , we discuss our model 's limitations compared to other state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds . Protein stability plays a crucial role in a variety of applications , such as food processing , therapeutics , and the identification of pathogenic mutations . In this work , we explore utilizing a mega-scale dataset to develop a protein language model optimized for stability prediction . ESMtherm performs reasonably on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set .

[DISCUSSION] Although its performance on larger protein scaffolds is lagging behind state-of-the-art , a folding stability dataset of larger proteins might be vital to improving the generalizability of ESMtherm . This approach generalizes successfully to protein domains distal from the training set , showing the potential of transfer learning to reduce experimental burden . Enabled by large-scale protein stability measurements , we fine-tuned ESM-2 on the absolute folding energy of small protein domains . Furthermore , our result highlights the benefits of training collectively on all protein sequences instead of mutagenesis study on a single wildtype . In this work , we demonstrate that folding stability prediction is possible using a protein language model .

[ABSTRACT] We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1D dataset ( N = 11 , 961 ) and found that iKIR genes , in the presence of genes encoding their ligands , have a consistent and significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations . In T1D , variation in the Human Leucocyte Antigen ( HLA ) genes explains up to 50 % of the genetic risk , indicating that T cells have a major role in T1D etiopathogenesis . We hypothesized that in the context of autoimmunity , where an enhanced T cell response might be considered detrimental , iKIRs would have an opposite effect . We conclude that iKIRs significantly decrease HLA class II protective associations and suggest that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D . To investigate if iKIRs affect this T cell response , we asked whether HLA associations were modified by iKIR genes . Inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ) are a family of inhibitory receptors that are expressed by natural killer ( NK ) cells and late-stage differentiated T cells . Recently , we reported that T cell-mediated control was enhanced by iKIRs in chronic viral infections . We studied Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) as a paradigmatic example of autoimmunity . There is accumulating evidence that iKIRs regulate T cell-mediated immunity . Our results were validated in an independent data set .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Although the absence of evidence for an interaction between functional iKIR genes and HLA class II genes in candidate gene studies can easily be explained by the argument that no one was motivated to study this particular three-way genetic association , it might be wondered why it was not picked up in one of the very large `` catch-all '' genome wide association studies ( GWAS ) performed in T1D [ 29-31 ] . Ligation of iKIRs expressed on the surface of T cells leads to phosphorylation of ITIMs in their cytoplasmic tail which recruits phosphatases including SHP1 leading to inhibition of TCR signalling which in turn can decrease effector function including cytokine production and regulation or modulate differentiation ; iKIRs on T cells have also been shown in vitro and in murine models to prolong CD8+ and CD4+ T cell lifetime . The reason is that three gene associations of the type we report ( KIR-ligand-class II ) are never studied in GWAS as the explosion in the number of multiple comparisons for comparing all triplets of variants is prohibitive and so it is to be expected that the functional iKIR modification of HLA class II associations which we report would not be found by GWAS . We predicted that an increase of T cell survival-driven by a high number of functional iKIR genes-would have a detrimental effect only when regulatory T cells are present at saturation levels , corresponding to individuals with a protective HLA class II genotype . Probably the most likely contender for such a population is NK cells as they express high levels of iKIR and are known to interact with APCs and T cells both of which could lead to a modulation of class II-restricted CD4+ cell responses . There are interesting parallels between these previous studies in chronic viral infection and this current study in T1D in that all show highly significant functional iKIR modification of protective HLA associations that can not be explained just by KIR or just by class I ligands . If we assume that the most detrimental compound genotype DRB1 * 03:01-DQA1 * 05:01-DQB1 * 02:01-DQB1 * 03:02 fails to produce the necessary islet-specific Tregs whereas the dominant protective genotype DQA1 * 01:02-DQB1 * 06:02 drives Treg levels close to carrying capacity , then the iKIR effect is only manifest in the highly protective end of the spectrum of HLA class II associations . We estimate that , even if we only consider a single protective class II genotype , a population with a low number of functional iKIR would see more than a 45 % increase in the fraction of cases prevented compared to a population with a high iKIR score . It is worth noting that in the majority of the analyses , the score is only used to split the cohorts in half , so second order changes to the calculation of the score will not necessarily change the results ( because a person 's score can change considerably , and they will still remain in the same strata ) . We did not find major differences in the size of KIR+ immune populations between cases and controls , suggesting , as hypothesized , that the direct ligation of iKIRs on T cells is not the main underlying mechanism of the functional iKIR gene effect . Our results demonstrate that functional iKIRs have a biologically significant impact on class II-associated protection , most likely via an impact on class II-restricted protective T cell responses , which manifest as a clinically significant difference in the risk of developing T1D . Whilst we are not aware of studies of functional iKIR modifications of HLA associations in T1D , we have previously reported functional iKIR modification of protective and detrimental HLA class I associations in three chronic viral infections : human immunodeficiency

[ABSTRACT] In summary , our study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms , RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation , both underpin the pathophysiology of FECD . Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ( FECD ) is an age-related cause of vision loss , and the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans characterised to date . Interrogation of long-read sequencing and alternative splicing analysis of short-read transcriptomic data together reveals the global extent of altered splicing occurring within Exp+ FECD , and unique transcripts associated with CTG18 . Furthermore , differential exon usage , pathway enrichment and spatial transcriptomics reveal TCF4 isoform ratio skewing solely in Exp+ FECD with potential downstream functional consequences . 1 expansion-driven molecular components of disease within primary patient-derived corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ) , generated from a large cohort of individuals with CTG18 . The non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4 have made it extremely challenging to experimentally decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease . We anticipate these data will inform and guide the development of translational interventions for this common triplet-repeat mediated disease . Up to 80 % of European FECD cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element ( termed CTG18 . 005 ) and potentially deleterious ( CADD > 15 ) TCF4 variants in 7/134 FECD Exp- cases , suggesting that TCF4 variants independent of CTG18 . Similarly , differential gene expression analysis highlights the total transcriptomic consequences of Exp+ FECD within CECs . We employ long-read , short-read , and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific transcriptomic biomarkers . Lastly , exome data from 134 Exp- FECD cases identified rare ( minor allele frequency < 0 . 1 ) located within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene , TCF4 . Here we comprehensively describe CTG18 . 1-expanded ( Exp+ ) and CTG 18 . 1 may increase FECD risk . 1-independent ( Exp- ) FECD . 1-expansions .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our extensive long- and short-read RNA-Seq data and spatial transcriptomic analysis of FECD case-derived CEC lines demonstrates that , in addition to being a spliceopathy , expansion-positive FECD is concurrently associated with isoform-specific patterns of TCF4 dysregulation , hence providing novel mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of this triplet-repeat mediated disease . We anticipate that concepts and biomarkers identified by this study will inform and guide the development of future translational interventions targeting this triplet-repeat mediated disease , and these in turn may act as exemplars for much rarer and currently untreatable and severe repeat expansion disorders that typically affect less accessible neurological/neuromuscular systems . Other membrane encoding proteins interfacing with the extracellular matrix or signal transduction could also be a rich source of potential external markers , such as cell surface receptors involved in the P13K-Akt pathway ( e. g. EGFR , MET , and LTK ) that we show are specifically upregulated in Exp+ CECs . For instance , we have discovered a novel array of RBP encoding transcripts , including MBNL3 , CELF1 and a range of hnRNP and DDX family members , uniquely dysregulated in Exp+ CECs that warrant future follow up to elucidate their respective contributions to aberrant RNA metabolism related mechanisms . To tackle this challenge , we employed a large , biologically independent set of primary FECD case-derived CEC lines and numerous complementary transcriptomic methodologies to gain novel mechanistic insight into both RNA toxicity driven and TCF4 dysregulation-related molecular features of this repeat-mediated disease . In addition to RNA metabolism biomarkers , global Exp+-mediated differential gene expression profiles , alongside TCF4-specific dysregulation itself , should also be included as relevant outcome measures for Exp+ therapies being developed , given we hypothesise these processes are also pivotal to the pathology . Parallels can be drawn to other repeat expansion-mediated disorders , such as fragile X syndrome ( FRM1 ) , spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 and C9orf72-mediated ALS , whereby rare loss-of-function mutations have been proposed to induce comparable phenotypic outcomes to non-coding repeat expansions . However , in these instances loss of total protein isoform function , in combination with toxic gain-of-function mechanisms , is thought to underlie the respective pathogenic mechanisms , in contrast to this scenario whereby we hypothesise only a fraction of total TCF4 isoforms are susceptible to the effect of either CTG18 . 1 within FECD-case derived CEC samples is anticipated to shed light on if and how genomic instability of this repeat element within the corneal endothelium may drive and/or exacerbate the pathophysiology and explain the unique vulnerability of this cell layer to CTG18 . Furthermore , given that domains in the AD3-containing isoforms can also dictate intracellular location and dimerization partners of TCF4 , we also hypothesise that additional TCF4-driven functional implications of this shift occur within affected CECs that requires future experimental investigation . Despite a rare variant gene-burden style analysis of these data not reaching significance , we observed an emerging trend whereby a subset of qualifying variants identified notably affected regions of the gene not included by the vast majority of TCF4 isoforms . Our long-read data suggests that the splicing diversity seen in Exp+ FECD is not predominantly a result of abnormal missplicing , given the proportion of annotated full splice match transcripts remains the same between control and Exp+ . We postulate that this convergence is being driven by TCF4 functional dysregulation , as the shift in isoform distributions towards shorter ( 1-2 AD domains ) versus longer ( 2-3 AD domains ) isoforms would result in lowered

[ABSTRACT] Direct seeding is employed to circumvent the labor-intensive process of rice ( Oryza sativa ) transplantation , but this approach requires varieties with vigorous low-temperature germination ( LTG ) when sown in cold climates . To investigate the genetic basis of LTG , we identified the quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) qLTG11 from rice variety Arroz da Terra , which shows rapid seed germination at lower temperatures , using QTL-seq . Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line ( NIL ) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG , whereas overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG , indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11 . We delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h ( GF14h ) gene , which is expressed during seed germination . Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost from popular varieties during modern breeding . The Arroz da Terra GF14h allele encodes functional GF14h , whereas Japanese rice variety Hitomebore harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region . We generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra including GF14h . The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions . The NIL showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore , with otherwise comparable agronomic traits .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] It is also worth mentioning that our experiments were performed in the qLTG11-NIL background , which allowed us to isolate the contribution of GF14h to LTG without any influence from qLTG3-1 or other genes in the Arroz da Terra background . This trend has continued to the present , perhaps as a result of artificial selection to improve resistance to pre-harvest sprouting , with more than 80 % of all varieties bred since 2001 carrying these loss-of-function alleles . Notably , the haplotypes of qLTG3-1 , a major QTL behind LTG , are different between Nipponbare and Hitomebore : whereas Nipponbare , which was released in 1961 , harbors the functional allele of qLTG3-1 , Hitomebore carries a loss-of-function allele with a deletion of 71 bp ( S2 Fig ) . In addition , as mentioned in previous reports , we believe that the reintroduction of functional alleles should be considered in order to develop cultivars suitable for labor-saving cultivation techniques such as direct seeding . Moreover , the cultivars Koshihikari and Hayamasari , which carry the same loss-of-function qLTG3-1 allele as the Hitomebore variety , were reported to exhibit lower germination rates at low temperatures than Nipponbare . We expect that reintroducing beneficial alleles like GF14hArroz that were lost during modern breeding into future rice varieties will enable the implementation of new cultivation practices and increase productivity . In a previous study , a genetic complementation assay with a functional GF14h allele introduced into the rice cultivar Nipponbare background increased the germination rate at 30°C , but only to a limited extent at 15°C . Based on these observations , it is likely that Nipponbare has a better LTG ability than Hitomebore , which may have masked the effect of functional GF14h on LTG in the previous study . In the current study , we showed that GF14h was expressed throughout the seeds , but with a transient induction in expression in the endosperm at roughly the time of initiation of seed germination . However , since rice is sensitive to low temperatures , improving seed germination and seedling establishment at low temperatures is a desirable breeding trait in high-latitude rice production areas such as Japan . These results suggest that the nonfunctional allele represented by Hap1 was introduced into temperate japonica varieties from tropical japonica varieties carrying Hap2 and then spread to Japanese cultivars . Further research is needed to elucidate the potential effects of higher frequencies of loss-of-function alleles on the overall phenotypic characteristics and ecological adaptability of Japanese rice varieties . We studied the haplotype frequencies of GF14h and qLTG3-1 in various Japanese landraces and cultivars , considering their time of release from breeding programs into the field . LTG tests using chromosome segment substitution lines derived from a cross between Koshihikari and Nipponbare indicated that qLTG3-1 contributes to the difference in LTG between the two varieties . However , the frequency of varieties carrying loss-of-function alleles for both GF14h and qLTG3-1 has increased since crossbreeding began in the early 20th century . Should the level of pre-harvest sprouting in NIL-GF14hArroz pose practical issues , the pyramiding of QTLs for pre-harvest sprouting resistance , such as Seed Dormancy 4 , may offer a solution . This result is not consistent with our finding that introducing functional GF14h into Hitomebore resulted in a significant improvement in germination at low temperature . The major advantage of this approach is that it can significantly decrease the amount of labor required by farmers during the busy spring season . However , it is challenging to overwinter the seeds of modern rice varieties in the soil and achieve good seedling establishment [ 40-42 ] . GF14h was reported to regulate seed germination by interacting with the abscisic acid and gibberellin signaling pathways at optimal temperatures . Therefore , the pyramiding of qPHS3-2 in NIL-GF14hArroz

Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) possesses an 8-9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy ( TR , or r ) on the negative ( - ) strand DNA derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) . To address these questions , a mutant HBV cell line HepDES-C1822G was established with a C1822G mutation in the pgRNA coding sequence , altering the sequence of 3 ' TR of ( - ) strand DNA while the 5 ' TR remained wild type ( wt ) . In a survey of known cellular flap endonucleases using a loss-of-function study , we found that the 3 ' flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells , alongside the 5 ' flap endonuclease FEN1 . It remains unclear whether the TR forms a 5 ' or 3 ' flap structure on HBV rcDNA and which TR copy is removed during covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) formation . The overlapping function between Mus81 and FEN1 in cccDNA formation indicates that the putative 5 ' and 3 ' flap formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursor . Additionally , we have mapped the potential Mus81 and FEN1 cleavage sites within the TR of nuclear DP-rcDNA by RACE-NGS analyses . These findings shed light on HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms , contributing to our understanding of HBV replication cycle . The production of HBV rcDNA and cccDNA in HepDES-C1822G cells was comparable to wt levels . [ INTRODUCTION ] [ RESULTS ] [ DISCUSSION ] We attempted to knock out both Mus81 and FEN1 by CRISPR but was unsuccessful , likely due to the requirement for at least one of these two flap endonucleases being present to maintain cell viability , and hence , although we have assessed all the four known flap endonucleases for their involvement in cccDNA formation , it remains possible that there is an unidentified flap endonuclease ( s ) plays redundant role in HBV rcDNA TR removal . III ) after 3 ' TR removal as described in scenario II , host DNA polymerases ( POLκ , α , δ ) are recruited to the gap and resynthesize the 3 ' TR using ( + ) strand DNA as template , then the continued DNA elongation displaces the 5 ' TR , forming a 5 ' flap for FEN1 to cut as shown in scenario I. IV ) both 5 ' and 3 ' flap structures are formed on the same nuclear DP-rcDNA molecule and simultaneously removed by FEN1 and Mus81 , respectively , followed by 3 ' TR resynthesis and ligation . While the ( + ) strand DNA sequencing results suggest that a DNA duplex forms between the 5 ' TR and the ( + ) strand during rcDNA formation , leaving the 3 ' TR as a flap ( Figs 1B and 3A ) , it is also plausible that a dynamic flap structure forms at both ends of the ( - ) strand after template switching during ( + ) strand elongation or after the deproteination of polymerase from rcDNA , or following the nuclear import of DP-rcDNA [ 25-27 , 31 ] . Given the potential differences of DNA repair machinery between normal and cancerous hepatocytes , it is crucial to validate the cccDNA-related cellular DNA repair factors initially identified in hepatocyte-derived cancer cell line systems using PHH cells , ideally from multiple batches and different donors , in this type of studies . Mammalian DNase IV enzymes , including FEN1 and XPG ( also known as ERCC5 ) , have been demonstrated to exhibit similar specificity for DNA structures rather than sequences ; both act with defined polarity by specifically cutting the strand that forms a 5 ' flap at double-stranded/single-stranded ( ds-ss ) junctions . On the other hand , we demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Mus81 or FEN1 in PHH cells inhibited de novo HBV infection , including cccDNA formation ; this inhibition was further enhanced by the double knockdown , confirming their cooperative role in cccDNA formation in the physiologically-relevant natural host cells for HBV infection ( Fig 11 ) . Knockout of Mus81 but not XPF in induced HepAD38 cells significantly reduced HBV cccDNA production ( ~70 % reduction ) without affecting cytoplasmic core DNA replication , and the results were consistent among multiple knockout cell clones ( Figs 4 , 5 and S2-S4 ) , suggesting that Mus81 is involved in rcDNA recycling-mediated cccDNA formation . A later study introduced mutation into the 5 ' TR of DHBV rcDNA and demonstrated that the mutated 5 ' TR was preferentially used as template for ( + ) strand synthesis ( ~85 % frequency ) but the mutation was significantly replaced by wt sequence on cccDNA ( 36-78 % frequency ) , indicating a preferential removal of mutant 5 ' TR during DHBV cccDNA formation in chicken hepatoma LMH cells .

[ABSTRACT] Here , we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model ( mmGEM ) based on metabolic cross-feeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory . Assessing cross-feeding dynamics under varying OLRs enabled the execution of practical scenario-based simulations to explore the potential impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance . Although microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified , comprehensive knowledge of the convergent community structure and pathways of adaptation is lacking . Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates ( OLRs ) increased , along with a decline in MFC performance . The efficiency of microbial fuel cells ( MFCs ) in industrial wastewater treatment is profoundly influenced by the microbial community , which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations . The simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide ( S ) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB . The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments . This work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs . The metabolic model encompassed three major microbial guilds : sulfate-reducing bacteria ( SRB ) , methanogens ( MET ) , and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria ( SOB ) . More cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET , facilitating their competitive dominance . The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs ( L-OLRs ) and adaptation to high OLRs ( H-OLRs ) .

[DISCUSSION] Through functional-based lumped compartmentalized modeling , the mmGEM facilitated a comprehensive study of the intricate dynamic metabolic interactions within microbial communities in MFCs , ultimately enhancing our understanding of microbial ecology and facilitating the optimization of MFC performance for various biotechnological applications . By increasing the amount of proton ( H+ ) in the MFC environment , we simulate the growth of SOB , enhance ATP production , strengthen SRB-SOB interactions , and boost MFC performance . This work highlights the significant role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial composition and MFC performance under varying OLRs . These interactions collectively led to changes in the composition and structure of the microbial community within the MFC system , finally impacting performance . The anticipated outcomes offered a hopeful prospect for the long-term functioning of MFCs , illuminating potential future applications within the industrial domain . Here , it presents a detailed description of the transition from an SOB-dominant community at L-OLRs to a MET-dominant community at H-OLRs , as the MFC performance declines . We propose a manipulation strategy to enhance MFC performance by sustaining the dominance of SOB under H-OLR conditions . Specifically , we observed a deterioration in SRB-SOB interactions , including S cycling and acetate cross-feeding . This transition can be attributed to dynamic interactions among microbial groups in the system . Additionally , we identified efficient acetate consumption by MET . Our findings unveiled various cross-feeding mechanisms .

The metabolic model encompassed three major bacterial guilds: sulphate-reducing bacteria ( SRB ) and methanogens ( MET ); sludge-oxidizing bacteria ( SOB )—which are able to grow under elevated acidity levels . We observed a shift from an SOB-dominant community at low OLRs ( L-OLRs ), to a MET-dominate community at high OLR conditions . Our findings revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sufate-sulfuride cycling and acetate cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET—facilitating their competitive dominance .

[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In addition to protein function annotation , we expect CPEC to be a valuable tool for researchers in other biological discovery applications particularly when a balance between the experimental budget and the high yield rate is desired , such as drug target identification , material discovery , and virtual molecule screening . One limitation of the CPEC framework is that when under covariate shift ( i. e. , Pcalib ( X ) ≠ Ptest ( X ) ) , the data assumption of CPEC that the data in the calibration and test sets are i. i. d. is violated , which might lead to suboptimal FDR control performances ( S6 and S7 Figs ) . Although weighted conformal prediction frameworks have been proposed to address this limitation , the quantification and control of non-monotonic risk functions ( e. g. , FDR ) under covariate shift remained a challenging problem . The evaluation of CPEC on the EC number prediction task showed that CPEC provides reliable FDR control and has comparable or better prediction accuracy than baseline methods at a much lower FDR . In this work , we define the error rate as the false discovery rate ( FDR ) to reflect the practical consideration in experiments where the goal is to maximize the success rate of hypothesis validation given a limited test budget . Although a few prior studies have investigated the uncertainty quantification of ML models , their uncertainty estimates are only indicative of prediction errors but do not translate to error-controlled predictions . Additionally , CPEC stands out by providing risk estimates , which delivers insights into the potential outcomes even before experimental validation and aids in the strategic allocation of experimental resources . When applied to unseen situations , ML models without uncertainty quantification are susceptible to overconfident predictions , which misdirects experimental efforts and resources to the validation of false positive hypotheses . Leveraging the conformal prediction framework , CPEC allows users to specify their desired FDR tolerance α , tailored to the experiment budget or goals and makes corresponding predictions with a controlled FDR . In contrast , CPEC enables researchers to specify a maximum level of error rate and produces a set of predictions whose error rate is guaranteed to be lower than the specified level . We demonstrate CPEC 's effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study , simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes . The conformal prediction algorithm in CPEC theoretically guarantees that the FDR of the predicted set of functions will not exceed α with high probability . Specifically , CPEC takes the sequence and structure of an enzyme as input and outputs a set of functions ( EC numbers ) that the enzyme potentially has . Machine learning models play a vital role in generating biological hypotheses for downstream experimental analyses and facilitating biological discoveries in various applications . Nevertheless , the CPEC framework can be extended to support other forms of error rates , such as false negative rate . Furthermore , CPEC demonstrated its robustness in making FDR-controlled predictions even for proteins with low sequence identity to its training set . A significant challenge in the process of ML-assisted biological discoveries is the development of ML models with interpretable uncertainty quantification of predictions . PenLight2 , an improved version of PenLight optimized for multi-label classification is utilized as CPEC 's base ML model . In this work , we have presented CPEC , an ML framework that enables FDR-controlled ML-assisted biological discoveries . Addressing this challenge becomes essential to ensure the efficiency and reliability of ML-assisted biological discovery .

[ABSTRACT] The heat shock responsive chaperone Hsp90 has been shown to interact with TDP-43 and stabilize its normal conformation ; however , it is not known whether this interaction contributes to neurotoxicity in vivo . Our data demonstrate for the first time that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS . Using a C. elegans model of fALS mutant TDP-43 proteinopathy , we find that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against TDP-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult animals . Aggregated , phosphorylated TDP-43 may contribute to disease phenotypes ; alternatively , TDP-43 aggregation may be a protective cellular response sequestering toxic protein away from the rest of the cell . Mutations in TARDBP , the gene coding for TDP-43 , can cause some cases of familial inherited ALS ( fALS ) , indicating dysfunction of TDP-43 drives disease . We also observe that the neuroprotective effect due to HSP-90 dysfunction does not involve direct regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans . We also find that hsp-90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress responsive heat shock pathway gene expression , including hsp-70 and hsp-16 . Neuronal inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 are hallmarks of disease for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . This protection is accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein . 1 are required for hsp-90 mutation effects on TDP-43 . 1 , and we demonstrate that normal levels of hsp-16 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Consistent with the improvement in animal motility , our results show that dysfunction of the HSP-90 chaperone in TDP-43M337V ; hsp-90 ( p675 ) animals produces a neuroprotective effect on GABAergic motor neurons ( Fig 2A and 2B ) , an effect that we did not observe when animals were maintained at their growth temperature ( 16°C ) without inactivation of HSP-90 ( Fig 2C ) . In the present work , we have observed how genetic disruption of hsp-90 leads to an increase in hsp-70 mRNA levels ( Fig 5B ) , which could contribute to the neuroprotective effect in our model of fALS , although RNAi targeting hsp-70 did not modify hsp-90 loss of function impacts on TDP-43 phenotypes ( Fig 5P ) . In C. elegans , HSP-90 modulates proteostasis by sequestering HSF-1 , preventing it from raising the turnover of proteins , and protecting new and mature proteins from being degraded under physiological conditions ; however , when cells are under stress , HSP-90 is dissociated from HSF-1 in order to activate the heat shock response , which includes the upregulation of hsp-70 . Similar to our results , other studies have shown how , in response to an upregulation of heat shock proteins from the hsp-16 family , there is a suppression of toxicity in other neurodegenerative diseases with a protein accumulation component , such as Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease [ 104-106 ] . Both 17-AAG and genetic inactivation of HSP-90 have a similar mechanism of action : the hsp-90 mutant has a point mutation at the C-terminus that induces a drastic charge change likely affecting protein function and reduced ATP turnover ( , and 17-AAG inhibitor binds Hsp90 N-terminally , acting as a competitive inhibitor for the ATP binding site ( . This is the first report in C. elegans models showing that TDP-43 ( M337V ) expression leads to likely proteasome activation , but other publications have shown similar results for animals expressing amyloid beta , another neurodegenerative disease associated aggregating protein . Our results have been confirmed by three different experimental approaches ; whether we tested Hsp90 chaperone dysfunction or inactivation in vivo or in vitro , using different experimental models , we show a protective effect against TDP-43 related pathology by reducing Hsp90 activity . However , during stress stimulus and disease , these protein complexes break down , increasing the accessibility of crystallins to interact with aggregation-prone proteins such as SOD1 or tau , and prevent the formation of pathological aggregates . Therefore , based on our results , autophagy rather than the proteasome may control clearance of phosphorylated TDP-43 when HSP-90 activity is abrogated , although future experiments will need to confirm this hypothesis . We also show that genetic inactivation in C. elegans or pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 in HEK293 cells partially reduces phosphorylated TDP-43 levels , indicating a conserved role in mediating TDP-43 protein dynamics ( Fig 3C and 3F ) . Either by genetic intervention or pharmacological inhibition , using Tanespimycin ( 17-AAG ) , we partially rescue neuronal function in our models of TDP-43 proteinopathy ( Figs 1A , 1C and 1D and S1A-S1C Fig ) . This indicates that while fALS associated TDP-43 triggers proteasomal changes , these changes are unlikely to be the main contributor or primary factor in the decreased protein accumulation observed in TDP-43 ( M337V ) ; hsp-90 ( p673 ) . Importantly , these data do not exclude the possibility that other components of the ubiquitin proteasome system , such as ubiquitin ligases or ubiquitin-binding proteins , contribute to the protective effect of Hsp90 inhibition through enhanced TDP-43 clearance . In order to test whether proteasomal changes underlie Hsp90-mediated TDP-43 protein accumulation or clearance , we generated a worm

[ABSTRACT] Additionally , we use the germ cells to explore gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis , highlighting its unique regulatory dynamics and allowing us to explore the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group . We map our data to the Fly Cell Atlas single-nucleus dataset of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary , shedding light on the conserved regulatory programs between the two distantly related Arthropod species . Our understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the Arthropod female reproductive system and the extent of their conservation is currently very limited . This is due to the focus on model systems , including Drosophila and Daphnia , which do not reflect the observed diversity of morphologies , reproductive modes , and sex chromosome systems . We use single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to produce a comprehensive single nucleus atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system . We identify the major cell types known to be present in the Artemia ovary , including germ cells , follicle cells , and ovarian muscle cells .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We used the same approach and percentile-based thresholds to check whether we see a similar pattern in the Drosophila testes dataset , and we only observe an enrichment in cells lacking dosage compensation in some of the germline clusters ( mainly in the meiotic and post-meiotic cell types ) , but no cells show extreme repression of the X chromosome ( S20 Fig ) . The fact that the reports of MSCI in Drosophila and chicken have been disputed later , and in many other species , such as moths and butterflies , the evidence so far suggests its absence , implies that the mechanism is either not as universal as initially assumed or that those species are exceptions to the rule . Our work also highlights single-nucleus RNA sequencing as a useful alternative to traditional approaches , such as epigenetic profiling and RNA-FISH , for identifying promising models for the study of meiotic sex chromosome regulation in species where it is difficult to isolate/identify nuclei of meiotic cells . More generally , broader sampling is needed to understand the role of the sex chromosome system ( female or male heterogamety ) , the extent of sex chromosome differentiation ( homomorphic or heteromorphic ) , the meiotic idiosyncrasies ( type of pairing and presence or absence of recombination ) , and repeat content/meiotic driver presence/activity in promoting the evolution of MSCI . It is important to note some limitations of our data , including the low capture level of total mRNA per cell ( high dropout rate ) , high ambient RNA , and sparse read mapping , which make confident inferences of silencing difficult . Previous studies have linked the observed conservation of several aspects of germline cyst development between distant species , such as of mice and Drosophila , to the critical role of germ cells in the preservation of the nuclear genome and the importance of early oocytes for embryonic development . Taken together , our data therefore generally points towards the possibility that repression of the sex chromosome occurs during oogenesis , although a demonstration that repressive chromatin marks are present on the Z will be needed to confirm this . We find that the two germline clusters include cells which seem to have very low S0 expression ( consistent with repression ) , and when we split the ATAC counts based on the expression zones , the repressed cells seem to have lower counts in the Z-specific region , consistent with the lowest accessibility . In our data , the two germline clusters ( germ cells A and germ cells B ) show lower S0/Autosomal expression ( Fig 5B ) , which seems to be driven by the enrichment in cells with S0 downregulation , consistent with a lack dosage compensation compared to somatic clusters . In Drosophila , Tracheal cells form the tracheal system , which transports oxygen to the different organs , while follicle cells are involved in many aspects of oogenesis , including control of egg shape , eggshell formation , and formation of appendages , such as the dorsal appendage . The absence of Escort cells from the unmated females suggests those cells are either late stage follicle cells , late stage germline/embryonic cells , or sperm ( the minority of cells that are assigned to the same cluster in replicates 3 and 4 after integration are likely to be misclustered germ cells A or B ) . The evolutionary hypotheses stemming for the mammalian case of MSCI sparked a lot of interest in understanding the conditions that favored the evolution of such a mechanism , and whether it is a universal consequence of having heteromorphic sex chromosomes . How such a clean slate is achieved in the presence of ZW chromosomes is unclear , as loss of dosage compensation in oocytes could lead to imbalances in expression that are then transmitted to the embryo maternally . The trachealess ortholog has also been found to be expressed in

[ABSTRACT] These results suggest specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia , thus offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom . While the specific mechanisms remain unclear , allodynia is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory ( E-I ) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord . We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling so that excitatory neurons are `` released '' from inhibitory control , or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses so that excitatory neurons `` escape '' their inhibitory control . Which of these mechanisms is most likely to occur , the subcircuit components involved in the mechanism , and the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure . Chronic pain is a wide-spread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage , costing the United States alone around $ 600 billion in 2010 . By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions , we specify model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions . In this work , we analyze biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn . These circuits are hypothesized to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two different types of allodynia : static and dynamic . Then , we implement a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit 's E-I signaling . We use neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit . In a common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia , non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with highly variable presentations across individuals .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] A limitation of the firing rate model formalism we implemented , which only models average population voltages and firing-rates , is that specific excitability characteristics or response features that are evident on the single neuron and spike levels may not be captured by the sigmoidal steady state firing rate activation functions . Continued experimental work identifying dorsal horn circuit structure and the functional relationships among diverse interneuron types will provide constraints necessary to improve models of spinal circuitry so that they can better participate in the development of therapies for this debilitating condition . 's finding that , in order to maintain healthy E-I balance , small reductions in inhibitory control of upstream excitatory populations required larger increases in inhibitory input to the downstream excitatory population suggests that perhaps their model parameter set may be analogous to Cluster 3 or 4 parameter sets in the dynamic subcircuit . Recent development of next-generation firing rate models that can be directly reduced from networks of individual neuron models provide the framework to include specific spiking patterns into a mean-field reduction , such as spike frequency adaptation . Such an extended model would be able to account for wind-up of projection neuron activity in response to repetitive brief C fiber input and also explicitly account for pain inhibition , namely the attenuation of C fiber response in the projection neurons in the presence of simultaneous Aβ input . Dysregulation of E-I balance in dorsal horn circuitry is a compelling cause supported by an array of pre-clinical studies , but our incomplete understanding of the circuitry and the building evidence for its complexity leave many questions for how the dysregulation occurs . Namely , there should be parameter sets in which the downstream excitatory neuron responses are primarily gated by direct inhibition from the inhibitory cells targeting them ( corresponding to Clusters 1 and 2 ) , and parameter sets in which their responses are limited by inhibitory control of the upstream excitatory populations ( corresponding to Clusters 3 and 4 ) . In models of more complex circuits , the space of unconstrained parameters is so high-dimensional that identifying the diversity of parameter sets that satisfy desired model behaviors is difficult , even when computational optimization algorithms are implemented . Our results predict that there should be parameter sets that limit responses to Aβ input in the downstream excitatory population through these synaptic pathways by mechanisms reflected by the clusters found for the dynamic subcircuit . Specifically , dynamic allodynia is mediated by Aβ fiber input which in healthy conditions is unable to activate laminae I-II nociceptive circuits , while static allodynia can be mediated by Aβ fiber input or by sensitized mechanical nociceptors ( Aδ or C fiber input ) depending on the pathological or experimental conditions . The identification of multiple types of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in dorsal horn circuits suggests that dysregulation may occur through multiple mechanisms that may be dependent on the nature of the injury or insult that induces the chronic pain condition . Nevertheless , we did constrain the dependence of population average firing rates on membrane voltages by fitting the steady state activation functions to frequency-voltage relationships measured in dorsal horn neurons . The methodology involves the following steps : This methodology can be applied to study any circuit of neural populations , although the implementation of Step 2 is more tractable for feedforward circuits with a relatively small number of populations . In this study , we introduced an analysis methodology for neural population model circuits that can determine parameter values

[ABSTRACT] In contrast , yeast expressing different groups of Hsp90 mutations or a different cochaperone mutation had altered sensitivity to diphtheria toxin , which is dictated by a unique posttranslational modification on eEF2 . Our results provide further evidence that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not just by assisting protein folding , but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins . Further , mutations in yeast eEF2 that mimic disease-associated mutations in human eEF2 were negatively impacted by loss of Hgh1 and growth of one mutant was partially rescued by overexpression of Hgh1 . In addition , these results provide further evidence that yeast Hsp90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochaperones . We examined the requirement for Hsp90 and cochaperones more closely and found that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two distinct roles in regulating eEF2 function . eEF2 folding was recently shown to be dependent on Hsp90 as well as the cochaperones Hgh1 , Cns1 , and Cpr7 . The growth of Hsp90 mutants that affected eEF2 accumulation was also negatively affected by deletion of the gene encoding Hgh1 . Yeast expressing one group of Hsp90 mutations or one group of cochaperone mutations had reduced steady-state levels of eEF2 . Protein homeostasis relies on the accurate translation and folding of newly synthesized proteins . Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ( eEF2 ) promotes GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during translation .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We showed that the yeast C372Y mutant , which corresponds to a de novo mutation in an individual with neurodevelopmental disorders , results in growth defects that were partially rescued by overexpression of HGH1 , suggesting that it may be possible to alleviate folding defects of some forms of mutated eEF2 . S2 Table summarizes our results , which suggest at least three possible fates of eEF2 upon alteration of Hsc82 : reduced accumulation with little or no impact on sensitivity to DT ( the reopening mutants ) ; reduced sensitivity to DT with some impact on steady-state levels ( loading and closing mutants ) ; or little or no effect on either accumulation or sensitivity to DT ( G424D , 'other ' ) . Our efforts to reproducibly detect and quantify differences in how Hsp90 mutation affects interaction with eEF2 or Hgh1 were unsuccessful , likely due to differences in the abundance of eEF2 , the transient nature of the of the interaction and/or background binding of Hsp90 to resin used during pulldown assays . Our hypothesis is that the mutated form of Utp21 is particularly reliant on the ability of Sti1 to load clients onto Hsp90 , and that the combination of two separate mutations that affect this process results in loss of the essential function of Utp21 in ribosome biogenesis . One possibility for the specific effect of the reopening mutants is that efficient folding of eEF2 requires a specific rate of ATP hydrolysis and/or nucleotide exchange , and that any mutant that delays ATP hydrolysis , ADP release , or alters the timing of the conformational cycle disrupts function . Hsp90 inhibition reduced the fidelity of start site selection , and evidence suggests that the accumulation of misfolded polypeptides due to translational infidelity triggers the heat shock response mediated by the transcription factor Hsf1 . Although a previous study in the Bolon lab showed that the rate of ATP hydrolysis did not appear to be a factor in affecting specificity for GR or v-src , this has not been tested for eEF2 . The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is an important drug target due to its role in chaperoning proteins required at multiple stages of cancer progression and proteins that promote fungal infections [ 59-61 ] . This is the first demonstration that a single Hsp90 client requires two genetically distinct functions of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone machine that differ in cochaperone requirement and the type of Hsp90 mutation that affects function . As summarized in Table 1 , our prior results that indicate a strong correlation between selective effects of Hsp90 mutations and subsets of cochaperones extends to eEF2 , the reopening mutants , and Hgh1 . They also used polysome run-off experiments to demonstrate that strains with reduced levels of Hgh1 , Cpr7 or Cns1 likely have defects in translation elongation or termination . Hsc82 mutants that most strongly affect eEF2 steady-state levels ( the reopening mutants ) show strong synthetic growth defects when combined with deletion of HGH1 , which also results in decreased steady-state levels of eEF2 . A mutation in UTP21 that results in mild growth defects on its own results in lethal or severe growth defects when combined with deletion of STI1 or when combined with Hsc82 mutants in the loading and closing group . Deletion of CPR7 or alteration of CNS1 caused increased sensitivity to translational inhibitors , and some hsc82 mutant strains also have varied sensitivity to hygromycin , supporting a role in translation . In yeast , the eEF2 mutations P580H and H699N result in increased -1 frameshifting , and cells expressing P580H exhibited an enhanced stress response , presumably due to the buildup of mistranslated proteins . Activity of v-src kinase was reduced in cells expressing either cdc37 or Hsc82 mutants in the loading and closing group ,

[ABSTRACT] Thus , we examined participants with lesions in insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , key regions implicated in risky decision-making , as they played a gambling task where choices were made both alone and after observing others ' choices . It remains unknown how such decisions are made when these preferences are inaccessible or disrupted , as might be the case for individuals confronting novel options or experiencing cognitive impairment . These findings suggest that in social contexts , following others ' choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted . For socially situated decisions , these participants showed increased conformity with the choices of others , independent from social utility-based computations . When making risky choices in social contexts , humans typically combine social information with individual preferences about the options at stake . Participants in both lesion groups showed disrupted use of standard utility-based computations about risky options .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Third , we note that the perceptual 'copy when uncertain ' strategy has exceptions ( e. g. , ) and similarly , the use of a 'follow others ' choices ' heuristic may not be universally implemented in individuals for whom utility-based risk preferences may be disrupted , inaccessible , or otherwise not present ( e. g. , during substance misuse , individuals with certain psychopathologies , adolescents confronting novel options ) . While our primary findings are based on robust parameter estimates of heuristic processes within the Hybrid model , the model comparison analyses indicate that the Hybrid model alone is unlikely to capture the range of social influences on risky decision-making ; future studies are necessary to implement study designs that allow these processes to be detangled ( see S4 Fig for further discussion ) . We emphasize that the 'follow others ' choices ' heuristic identified in the current study is consistent with a 'copy-when-uncertain ' strategy previously demonstrated in perceptual decision-making , such that individuals are more likely to rely on the behaviors of others when they are less confident about their own decisions [ 34-36 ] . Lastly , we point out that the model comparison analyses indicate that the Hybrid model was not well dissociable from the OCU-based , OCU-free , and Solo RP models , perhaps due in part to the nested nature of these models or the presence of multiple overlapping processes during socially-situated decision making about risky options . While we previously demonstrated in non-lesioned adults using the same task that effects on participants ' behavior was indeed 'social ' ( i. e. , no influence on participants choices were observed in a non-social visually controlled experiment ; Supplemental Fig 8 from ) , this may not extend to individuals with insula and/or dACC lesions . Second , we combined participants with dACC or insula lesions into a single 'lesion group ' because of the common role of these regions in risk processing [ 18-23 ] and to maximize power for our primary intention of examining socially situated decision-making under risk . First , although the information being shown to participants in this study is social information ( i. e. , choices of others ) , it is possible that influences on participant choices may be due to a more general visual or information effect , whereby merely seeing other information ( regardless of its source ) may influence behavioral choices . We also considered our work in the context of prior work implicating dMFC ( often extending into dACC ) in social processes [ 7 , 26 , 31-33 ] ; while we did not observe social-specific differences in our dACC vs insula participants , this is an area of relevant future study . While to our knowledge , this work is among the first to show evidence of disrupted risk processing in participants with dACC lesions , it is perhaps unsurprising , given that dACC and insula frequently co-activate in functional neuroimaging studies of risk-related decision-making . Starting with this flat prior , a Bayesian process would indicate that any subsequent choices made under social influence would be primarily driven by the social information because the social information carries more certainty than does the individuals ' computed utility difference between the choices at hand . Our post-hoc analyses examined whether insula and dACC participants differed with regard to disruptions in risk processing ; we found no evidence of group differences between insula and dACC participants in power-utility model fit to their choices on Solo trials . Of note , although a 'follow others ' choices ' heuristic seems qualitatively different from utility-based use of social information , one framework that captures both paths is a Bayesian-like update framework , in which individuals use social information to update their likelihood of choosing the safe gamble [ 37-40 ] . In previous studies using the same task , we have shown that when making decisions under risk , individuals combine social information with personal preferences and do so by adding other-conferred utility to

[ABSTRACT] By using population genetics simulations , we demonstrate how moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently upon random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent . In particular , we find that biomorphs exhibit phenotype bias , a type of developmental bias where certain phenotypes can be many orders of magnitude more likely than others to appear through random mutations . This result , as well as many other patterns found in the structure of variation for the biomorphs , such as high mutational robustness and a positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness , closely resemble findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps . Such bias towards simplicity is formalised by an information-theoretic principle that can be intuitively understood from a picture of evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms . We postulate that the phenotype bias towards simplicity and other patterns biomorphs share with molecular genotype-phenotype maps may hold more widely for developmental systems . Biomorphs , Richard Dawkins 's iconic model of morphological evolution , are traditionally used to demonstrate the power of natural selection to generate biological order from random mutations . Many of these patterns can be explained with an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome . Here we show that biomorphs can also be used to illustrate how developmental bias shapes adaptive evolutionary outcomes . Moreover , this bias exhibits a strong preference for simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Indeed , phenotypic changes observed in phylogenies of angiosperm leaf shapes tend to be strongly biased towards simpler phenotypes and experiments on developmental pathways for mouse teeth suggest that mutations leading to simpler tooth shapes are more common than those that lead to increased tooth complexity because the latter scenario requires a coordinated change in several pathways . If simplicity bias in GP maps follows from very general intuitions based on the algorithmic infinite monkey theorem , as formalised by AIT , then we might expect it to hold for a much wider range of GP maps than have been studied so far . The same is true for the biomorphs GP map : when we restrict the value of the ninth gene to a constant ( section E in S1 Text ) , the sequence constraints in the analytic model are the same for every genotype and phenotype , but the computational data still displays variations in neutral set sizes , complexities , robustness and evolvability . Our analytic calculations reveal one key reason for the similarities between the GP map of biomorphs with that of molecular structures : the analytic model falls into the same class of sequence-constraint-based models that have been used to explain universal behavior observed in molecular GP maps . Even if the probability that a particular individual phenotype appears upon random mutations is typically higher if its complexity is lower , the probability P ( K ) that a random mutation generates a phenotype of complexity K may still peak at a higher K because there are simply many more possible phenotypes with higher K ( see and section D. 4 in S1 Text ) . In other cases , including the RNA secondary structures and branching morphologies ( see ref ) , different signatures of simplicity need to be employed to identify processes that can be described by shorter algorithms , which should be easier to find through random mutations . It is reasonable to expect that a mutation-induced change between more similar phenotypes will result in smaller fitness differences , lowering the probability of deleterious mutations , and increasing the likelihood of finding pathways with small incremental changes . Such changes to the genotype structure and the phenotype construction can allow the model itself to evolve , in other words , future simulations should not just model evolution on the GP map , but also evolution of the GP map , as advocated in ref . We believe that this tractable toy model of development has been understudied in the literature , and show that the biomorphs GP map displays a remarkably rich structure in the mapping from genotypes to phenotypes . Our simulations show that phenotypic bias can have an influence on adaptive evolution : when several phenotypes convey an adaptive advantage , the more frequent ( and therefore usually the simpler ) phenotype is more likely to evolve . Such an interplay can help illustrate that phenomena such as developmental bias and natural selection are not in opposition , but should rather be seen as dual causes in a richer explanatory landscape . This research program would entail combining the power of natural selection , demonstrated by Dawkins 's 2nd infinite monkey theorem , with an algorithmic account of how structured variation arises , illustrated by the 3rd monkey theorem . The molecular models most studied in the literature are typically based on minimum-free-energy folding ( for example protein lattice models and RNA folding models ) , molecular self-assembly ( for example models of protein quaternary structure ) or network topologies ( for example gene regulatory networks ) . Problems typically studied in evo-devo are far from being as tractable or having the abundant data that the GP maps for RNA secondary structures or protein

[ABSTRACT] This human sensitivity to resonance has been experimentally supported for interactions with simple linear systems but remains a challenge to validate in more complex scenarios where nonlinear dynamics can not be predicted analytically . Even for increased task accuracy ( Experiment 2 ) and targets located away from the NNM ( Experiment 3 ) , participants could successfully accomplish the task , likely by adjusting their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics to better align the resonant motions to the task . Our findings emphasize the human capabilities to apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions , including possibly shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness . In all tested experiment variations , participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems . In a user study consisting of three experiment parts , participants commanded differently configured virtual double pendula with joint compliance through a haptic joystick . The task was to alternately hit two targets , which were either aligned with the NNM ( Experiments 1 and 2 ) or purposefully arranged offset ( Experiment 3 ) . Activities like ball bouncing and trampoline jumping showcase the human ability to intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that the system prefers intrinsically . Using this tool , the present resarch compared the motions that humans excite in nonlinear systems with the predicted NNM of the energy-conservative systems . However , it has been found that many nonlinear systems exhibit periodic orbits similar to the eigenmodes of linear systems . Consequently , our experiments extend the existing research on human resonance sensitivity with data-based evidence to nonlinear systems . These nonlinear normal modes ( NNM ) are computable with a recently developed numerical mode tool .

[DISCUSSION] Although interactions with more system variations should be investigated in the future , the experiments highlighted the fundamental importance of resonance for humans and their capabilities to excite it . For the first time , the presented research could provide data-based evidence that human resonance sensitivity extends to object interactions with nonlinear dynamics . The contribution of this research is twofold : first , we introduced methods that expand analysis options for human interactions with nonlinear systems . Therefore , this research contributes to identifying underlying mechanisms driving human motion planning and control , especially during the excitation of periodic motions . Second , the findings advance existing insights about human motor control strategies and their flexible adaptation to best suit a given task .

[ABSTRACT] Genetic analysis of the relationship between the three transcription factors indicate that all are necessary to limit pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced . TSRs influence numerous developmental processes including the decision between biofilm formation and motility , genetic competence , and sporulation , but the extent to which TSRs influence bacterial physiology remains to be fully elucidated . Similarly , expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC was found to be under control of ScoC , AbrB , and PchR and correlated with the amount of pulcherrimin produced by each background . Here , we demonstrate two TSRs , ScoC and AbrB , along with the MarR-family transcription factor PchR negatively regulate production of the iron chelator pulcherrimin in B. subtilis . Gene expression in cells transitioning from exponential phase to stationary phase is under the control of a group of transcription factors called transition state regulators ( TSRs ) . Regulation of transcription is a fundamental process that allows bacteria to respond to external stimuli with appropriate timing and magnitude of response . Lastly , our in vitro data indicate a weak direct role for ScoC in controlling pulcherrimin production along with AbrB and PchR . In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis , transcriptional regulation is at the core of developmental processes needed for cell survival . The layered regulation by two distinct regulatory systems underscores the important role for pulcherrimin in B. subtilis physiology .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While expression patterns of yvmC-GFP promoter fusion closely resembled the pattern of pulcherrimin production , the reporter in the scoC : :erm and abrB : :kan background displayed broad distributions of promoter expression , suggesting the TSRs influence heterogeneity in pulcherrimin producing cells . Thus , control by ROS and TSRs agrees with an antioxidant role for pulcherrimin wherein intracellular and extracellular iron is sequestered as cells enter stationary phase , limiting proliferation of reactive oxygen species . While no small ligand has been identified as an allosteric regulator of PchR activity , He and colleagues have identified ROS as a signal that alleviates DNA binding by PchR in Bacillus licheniformis . A neighboring MarR-family transcription factor YvnA was also identified as a regulator of pulcherrimin biosynthesis in B. licheniformis , where it bound directly to the intergenic region between yvmA and yvmC . Interestingly , the abrB deletion had a larger effect on maximum pulcherrimin production in B. licheniformis than in B. subtilis , indicating that despite similar regulatory components , their effects appear species specific . One possibility is that the different genetic organizations of the pulcherrimin biosynthetic gene cassette may necessitate alternative forms of regulation , thus explaining the difference between B. licheniformis and B. subtilis . Microarray analysis of the effect of scoC on global gene expression was carried out from cells sampled at different points in the growth cycle in complex media . Our biochemical analysis shows the regulator of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis operon and the transition state regulators ScoC and AbrB bind to the yvmC promoter with differing apparent off-rates . This could be due to the rich , complex media used during the experiment , as B. subtilis grown in media with certain amino acids present have lower levels of scoC expression compared to media without amino acids . While this has not been shown in B. subtilis , C57 in B. licheniformis is structurally conserved in B. subtilis ( C55 ) , suggesting ROS acts as a signal to induce pulcherrimin production in B. subtilis ( Fig 7B ) . While hundreds of genes were found to be differentially regulated in the ΔscoC background , expression of genes involved in pulcherrimin biosynthesis were not identified as significantly different from the WT background . In B. subtilis , the pchR gene is located adjacent to yvmA and divergently transcribed from yvmC-cypX ( Fig 1B ) and binds to a consensus motif ( PchR-box ) upstream of yvmC and pchR . The absence of these regulators modifies sporulation , competence , protease production , and biofilm formation among many other phenotypes [ 7 , 10 , 36 , 38 , 41-44 ] . Recent studies found that B. subtilis in biofilms produce pulcherrimin as a form of niche protection by creating a zone of iron limitation around the biofilm . The transition state regulators ScoC and AbrB have been subject to much research for their roles in diverse aspects of Bacillus physiology . Our finding that TSRs negatively control pulcherrimin production is notable due to the relationship between stationary phase and ROS tolerance in B. subtilis . It is possible that our larger protection area represents AbrB binding in the absence of other proteins , such as PchR and ScoC . Together , our results indicate pulcherrimin regulation in Bacillus subtilis is under tight regulation and repressed during exponential growth by two distinct regulatory systems . We demonstrate that these systems work together to inhibit the biosynthetic pathway of an energetically costly and potentially growth limiting metabolite . Other groups found that pulcherrimin production increased resistance to ROS , likely by decreasing the amount of iron available for Fenton reactions . Only in the absence of all three transcription factors is yvmC gene expression fully achieved and pulcherrimin is produced throughout

[ABSTRACT] When we investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic TMS at two frequencies applied at or below T10 , the model replicated the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that has been observed clinically : low-frequency TMS ( 1 Hz ) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI , whereas high-frequency TMS ( 30 Hz ) enhanced urine storage . Neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons , beyond what is necessary to simulate normal bladder function , must be present in order to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition , and both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms whereby TMS reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI . We defined , within a mathematical model , the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after a SCI and incorporated into this model the minimum additional neurophysiological features sufficient to replicate the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS of the spine in patients with SCI . We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI , and we increased the density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a more diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of spinal interneurons that remains after SCI . DSD and incontinence reflect the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle , which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination , and urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles , which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit bladder emptying . After spinal cord injuries ( SCIs ) , patients may develop either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) or urinary incontinence , depending on the level of the spinal injury . We created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations that replicated normal bladder function . Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced DSD and incontinence . The model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI .

[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Insights from this modeling illustrate how an integrated , systems-level modeling approach can advance the understanding of neural dysfunction , which is essential to determine the neuronal basis of adverse effects of SCI so that rehabilitation and neuromodulation may be used to ameliorate the neurological disorders following SCI . The effect of TMS at the network level was analyzed through model simulations , which revealed possible mechanisms underlying the amelioration of the detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia by TMS and the mechanism whereby low ( but not high ) frequency TMS was effective for this purpose . A model of the neural circuits was developed by building on a state-of-the-art model to capture the normal storage/voiding functions under healthy conditions and typical disorders of the bladder after SCI , such as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and overactivity of the bladder . We developed a basic framework for model-based analyses of neural circuits controlling micturition after SCI and of the effects of TMS on the spinal cord as a therapeutic intervention to alleviate bladder dysfunction following SCI . The effect of TMS on the spinal cord was modeled at the single-cell level based on recent experimental findings from patch-clamp and extracellular recordings .

[ABSTRACT] Our model outperformed reference models at fitting to and predicting OD600 growth curves and overcame observed discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD600 versus directly measured data in reference models that did not include calibration . In this paper , we propose a mathematical model of fungal growth to estimate morphology-specific growth rates from easy-to-collect , but indirect , optical density ( OD600 ) data of Aspergillus fumigatus growth ( filamentous fungus ) . Our method accounts for OD600 being an indirect measure by explicitly including the relationship between the indirect OD600 measurements and the calibrating true fungal growth in the model . However , automated large-scale collection of such data lies beyond the scope of most clinical microbiology laboratories . Current methods quantify fungal growth rates from time-course morphology-specific data , such as hyphal length data . Therefore , the method does not require de novo generation of calibration data . Quantifying fungal growth underpins our ability to effectively treat severe fungal infections .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] However , none of these models can be reused to estimate growth rates of filamentous fungi from OD because all the models either require OD data that has been pre-processed using collected calibration data or the models are directly fit to OD , with one study even highlighting OD calibration as a problem when estimating growth rates . In summary , this study proposed a mathematical model to infer a biologically interpretable and morphology-specific fungal growth rate from indirect OD600 data without the need for collecting calibration data and , hence , is accessible to all microbiology laboratories that collect OD600 data , rather than just specialist laboratories . Methods have already been proposed to accelerate Bayesian inference of large-scale models whose linear transform is the only observed output , which would facilitate estimation of fungal growth rates should the expansion of our model dramatically increase computation time . However , we anticipate that modelling a nonlinear calibration curve whilst retaining a parametric model would make key parameters of interest ( e. g. fungal growth rates ) difficult to infer because large differences in the parameter values may no longer correspond to measurable differences in observed OD . However , investigating time- and morphology-specific antifungal modes of action using mechanistic modelling or estimating growth rates is currently hampered in clinical microbiology laboratories by arduous methodologies reliant upon sophisticated technologies . Another study proposed predicting microbial growth curves from OD by fitting population growth models to data that details the first time the OD reader can detect growth in wells initialised with different initial inocula . Another interesting avenue for future research would be to explore more complex relationships between measured OD and fungal growth , since a linear calibration curve is not necessarily reflective of the true relationship between measured OD and fungal growth for large OD . Future mechanistic models can use our presented model as a foundation to investigate mechanisms of antifungal action using only OD600 data by inferring and subsequently comparing growth rates of fungi in varying antifungal concentrations . Moreover , we found that directly fitting models of true fungal growth to OD600 data resulted in model misfit and distinctly lower growth rates compared to growth rates estimated from direct measures for filamentous fungi . Previously , a non-mechanistic piecewise-linear model was fit to OD600 data to detect the number of change-points in the growth curves that does not consider OD being an indirect measure of growth . The model captured observed dynamics in OD600 growth data ( Fig 3 ) and outperformed population growth models previously used in OD modelling in terms of RMSE and relative LPD when predicting held-out test data during CV ( Fig 4 ) . Thirdly and finally , parametric models more readily allow for known fungal growth mechanisms to be included in the model than non-parametric models , for example including different initial fungal inocula of an experiment in the model . In the wider microbiology community , calculating growth rates to characterise and compare growth dynamics of microbes , such as bacteria or yeast , in different conditions is common [ 38 , 40 , 41 , 44-52 ] . In addition , various methods to improve bacterial growth rate estimation from OD have been proposed , such as the use of GP models , where growth rates are calculated empirically post-inference . Secondly , our model benefits from explicit inclusion of a growth rate , as opposed to GP-based models that provide an empirical post-hoc estimation of the growth rate , because it increases biological interpretability . For filamentous fungi , we do not know the maximum carrying capacity of a well or the fungal concentration at the first OD detection time or any pre-chosen OD without the collection of calibration data . However , the method requires that the well 's maximum carrying capacity is known along with the microbial number at the first time the OD reader can detect growth or a pre-chosen OD value .

[ABSTRACT] We generated a whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confusum , which has a neo-sex chromosome , and utilize eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera . These neo-sex chromosomes evolve the stereotypical properties of sex chromosomes , including the evolution of dosage compensation and a non-random distribution of genes with sex-biased expression . Beetles thus provide a novel model to gain a better understanding of the diverse forces driving sex chromosome evolution . Most species have XY sex chromosomes , but X0 sex determination mechanisms are also common in some groups . While the ancestral X chromosome is maintained across beetles , we find independent additions of autosomes to the ancestral sex chromosomes . We identify ancestral linkage groups , termed Stevens elements , that share a conserved set of genes across beetles . Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] An abundance of beetles and further development of genomic and functional tools will make Coleoptera a valuable model system to study the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary forces driving the differentiation of sex chromosomes across taxa . Our broad phylogenetic sampling of beetles suggests that they will be a promising model to study patterns of karyotype evolution , and evolutionary forces operating on sex chromosomes . We find that the ancestral X is conserved in Coleoptera , but identify multiple independent formations of neo-sex chromosomes , even among closely related beetle species .

[ABSTRACT] To explore this possibility , we generated mRNA transcript profiles for wild-type , htz1Δ , swr1Δ , and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea ( HU ) , which induces DNA replication stress . Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure , and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes . Z , encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in S. cerevisiae , is an evolutionarily conserved H2A histone variant that is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR1-complex ( SWR1-C ) . We also observed that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant , particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation . Z enrichment at transcription start sites was correlated with , but generally not required for , the upregulation of genes during HU exposure . However , given that growth defects of htz1Δ mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SWR1-C subunits , previous work examining the role of H2A . Z has often been implicated in transcription regulation , htz1Δ mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type . Z in gene expression regulation may be confounded by deleterious activity caused by SWR1-C when missing its H2A . Z mutants only display significant growth defects in genotoxic stress conditions , a more substantive role for H2A . Chromatin structure and DNA accessibility are partly modulated by the incorporation of histone variants . Z in gene expression may only be uncovered after exposure to cellular stress . Z incorporation before and after treatment with HU revealed that decreases in H2A . Together this study characterized the regulatory effects of H2A . Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to HU . Our data showed that H2A . Z substrate ( apo-SWR1-C ) . Furthermore , as H2A . Furthermore , mapping H2A . While H2A . H2A .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] For instance , in addition to depleting dNTP pools , HU exposure increases the production of reactive oxidative species , stalls replication forks , and increases the number of transcription-replication conflicts [ 44-46 ] , events that all have the potential to disrupt proper chromatin assembly and therefore increase widespread promiscuous transcriptional activity across the genome . Therefore it is likely that results from previous microarray analysis , which found an equal number of upregulated and downregulated genes in the htz1Δ mutant , are largely the consequence of using steady-state experimental conditions [ 18 , 22 , 36-38 ] . Z may be involved in the rapid transcriptional reprogramming necessary for cells to adapt to the introduction of cellular stress , which would not be immediately evident when evaluating bulk mRNA levels 90 minutes after a gene is induced . Therefore , while several of the identified DEGs were specific to each genotype , which is consistent with previous work , our results suggest that a shared set of genes were dysregulated across each mutant , differing only in the severity of the expression defect . For example , HUG1 , a ribonucleotide reductase ( RNR ) inhibitor that is highly upregulated upon DNA replication stress , exhibited lower transcript levels in the HU-treated condition in all three mutants compared to wild-type . Furthermore , by comparing gene expression between untreated and HU-treated conditions we showed that several genes highly upregulated during HU-exposure had smaller fold changes in the absence of H2A . While both the swr1Δ mutant and htz1Δswr1Δ mutant generally had indistinguishable gene expression from one another , there were subtle differences that may be attributed to nonspecific interactions of unincorporated H2A . Collectively , our results underscore the importance of both accounting for the confounding effects of apo-SWR1-C and using a model that induces widespread transcriptional changes to effectively examine the general role of H2A . Coinciding with this idea , in vitro experiments have demonstrated that SWR1-C binding is sufficient to initiate , but not complete , DNA unwrapping from nucleosomes , which may have transcriptional consequences in vivo . Our data provide new insights into how differences in gene expression could contribute to the slow growth phenotypes of the htz1Δ , swr1Δ , and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants during HU exposure . All together , these differences in expression provide a possible explanation for why the htz1Δ , swr1Δ , and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants are sensitive to HU exposure and DNA replication stress in general . Given that the iron regulon optimizes RNR protein function , and downregulation of PHO operon genes results in reduced nucleotide steady-state levels and de novo nucleotide synthesis , our results suggest that H2A . Here we showed that controlling for the additive effects of apo-SWR1-C , or examining gene expression during HU exposure , revealed that the majority of DEGs caused by the absence of H2A . These pathways are particularly noteworthy as an important part of the transcriptional response to HU is centered around replenishing depleted dNTPs pools and optimizing their usage . Our results revealed that DEGs exhibited the greatest deviation from wild-type in the htz1Δ mutant , with more intermediate expression levels observed in the swr1Δ and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants . Given that many of the genes induced by HU exposure are also part of the ESR , a general stress response pathway in yeast , it is plausible that H2A . Z was involved in the regulation of the transcriptional response to HU , and its function in gene expression was not entirely dependent on its specific incorporation at

We found that Z incorporation before and after exposure to hydroxyurea ( HU ) induces DNA replication stress , a more substantive role for H2 A . The htz1 mutant exhibits minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type , and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes .

[ABSTRACT] Overall our findings show how hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies can help solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles , interestingly these methods rely on a much less stringent type of annotated datasets compared to fully supervised learning methods . The partial label learning framework assumes that we can obtain a set of candidate labels containing the correct one for each data point , a simpler setting than requiring a fully supervised training dataset . We study and extend when needed state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods , such as SVM , kNN , prototype-based , logistic regression and ensemble methods , to the partial label learning framework . An important current question is how to classify transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNASeq experiments into the various cell types and identify the lineage relationship for individual cells . We show , on simulated and real datasets , that these extensions enable to learn from partially labeled data , and perform predictions with high accuracy , particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method . Because of the fast accumulation of datasets and the high dimensionality of the data , it has become challenging to explore and annotate single-cell transcriptomic profiles by hand . Finally , we study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data , and derive some prescriptive results on the effect of this uncertainty on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods . However , due to the difficulty of obtaining data annotated at single-cell resolution , we propose instead to take advantage of partial annotations . We demonstrate that the performances of our methods trained with partially annotated data reach the same performance as fully supervised data . Single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNASeq ) data plays a major role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology . We focus particularly on the hierarchical structure of the labels , as commonly observed in developmental processes . Moreover , we study the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods . To overcome this challenge , automated classification methods are needed . Classical approaches rely on supervised training datasets .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In conclusion , the flexibility and adaptability of the partial label learning framework is a key step in making transcriptomic single-cell data annotation easier and the corresponding prediction even more routinely used to interrogate the nature of the mechanisms underlying cell differentiation . In an era where transcriptomic data is being generated increasingly , being able to automatize more and with less expert knowledge the task of automatic cell type classification is highly relevant , as the quality of the annotation is currently the bottleneck . Because we showed that the highest performing partially labeled classifier is a nonlinear Prototype-Based method , we understand that the relationship between cell type identity and position in the feature space is not a linear function . Similarly , we could be using tissue level information which is at scale high than cellular by nature and use all of the cell types expected in this tissue as a candidate label set . Our results , showing that we can perform multiclass classification with high accuracy on partially labeled data can be associated to the fact that transcriptomic datasets are highly structured and lie on a low dimensional manifold . Similarly , recent experimental assays have led to combining multiple -omics , automated classification methods could also take advantage of these heterogeneous sources of data to infer cellular identity . Therefore when the number of samples is low , it will be more difficult to learn the underlying geometry of the data as there is less data points to sample the underlying manifold . Altogether , we propose an approach that helps reduce the time spent on precise annotation of training datasets by considering sets of candidate labels per sample . Our results suggest that we could for example be using the classification results obtained from other already existing annotated datasets as a way to construct partial annotation for a new datasets . Ultimately , we found that incorporating hierarchical information could significantly increase performance in partial label settings , particularly in extreme situations with low number of training samples . Furthermore , we showed that incorporating partially labeled training samples corresponding to certain labels improved the performance on labels for which supervised samples were also available at training time . We envision that our approach could benefit from lineage information obtained directly at the level of data acquisition as it is the case with lineage tracing methods . This is in line with the idea of learning the underlying geometry of the set of transcriptomic profiles and suggests moreover that the distribution of transcriptomic profiles in space is consistent with the label set hierarchical structure . Indeed when training a classifier on several transcriptomic profiles , even if they 're partially annotated , will necessary take advantage of their geometrical properties . Moreover , in addition to the automatic cell type classification task , one of the current challenges is to be able to combine multiple studies and atlases . The experiments demonstrated that our approach , specifically the Prototype-Based Neural Network ( PB-nn ) , achieved remarkably high accuracy in a fully supervised setting . Altogether we found that including the right amount of complexity in the model will lead to a sufficient amount of expressivity to learn the nonlinear distributions of transcriptomic profiles . Our findings also provided insights into the effect of the level of uncertainty in partial labeling , allowing us to achieve the best performance . Equally impressive was the

[ABSTRACT] Our results show for the first time that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) associates with PIP2 in the RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions , and that altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein . Thus , we propose that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins and affects their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation . We found that intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins . In this study , we unveiled the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) nuclear proteome in human cells by mass spectrometry . Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) is found in nuclear speckles , nucleoli , and nuclear lipid islets and is involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription . This suggests the pivotal role of PIP2 in the establishment of a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression . The RNA content is crucial for the formation of nuclear compartments , such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli . Moreover , these IDRs of RDPA proteins exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation , acetylation , and ubiquitination sites . We therefore investigated whether PIP2 and RNA cooperate in the establishment of nuclear architecture . Intriguingly , the nuclear localization of PIP2 was also shown to be RNA-dependent .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] We used the Database of Disordered Protein Predictions , and all nine different IDR predictors showed a similar bimodal distribution pattern of IDRs ( only IDRs with a minimum length of 20 amino acid residues were considered ) based on their pI ( Figs 2D , S6 and S7A ) . In contrast , we observed an increased association of BRD4 with the PLC PH domain-conjugated beads in nuclear lysate pull-downs compared to the condition without RNA addition , suggesting that dextran may function similarly to RNA in enhancing BRD4 association with PIP2-containing complexes ( Fig 4B ) . To further test the specific effect of RNA on BRD4 protein , we set up an experiment where we added the same amount of purified recombinant GST-tagged GST-PLCδ1 PH or its mutant variant R40A domains to the nuclear lysate as internal controls . To assess the abundance of PIPs binding domains in the RDPA proteome , we generated in parallel several reference datasets by analyzing the nuclear and cytosolic fractions isolated from the same HeLa cell line using the same LC-MS/MS proteomic pipeline ( see M & M section for more details ) . These data are consistent with the previously observed effect of RNA on the condensation capacity of BRD4 in vitro and suggest that both higher-order RNA and nuclear PIP2 must be in fine balance to ensure that the correct number of BRD4 foci is formed . Based on these data , we hypothesize that the structured higher-order RNA binds PIP2 via Mg2+ and attracts the BRD4 protein , thus locally increasing its concentration and eventually leading to the formation of a condensate in the vicinity of a PIP2-containing surface . These data are consistent with siRNA depleted SHIP2 since BRD4 foci number were increased upon SHIP2 inhibition ( S22 Fig ) and suggest that the changes in BRD4 foci are indeed in correlation to nuclear PIP2 levels and not an indirect result of depletion of the SHIP2 enzyme . In contrast , histone modifications , nucleosome positioning , transcription elongation from the RNA polymerase II promoter , and ncRNA metabolism were enriched specifically for proteins with shorter K/R motifs in IDRs ( S16C and S17C Figs and S26 and S29 Tables ) . Finally , the RDPA proteome is enriched for proteins with both RNA binding and phase separation capabilities together ( Figs 2A and S4A and S8 Table ) , suggesting that these two properties are linked , as described elsewhere . We observed that RNase III-mediated RNA cleavage greatly reduced the total nuclear PIP2 signal , whereas based on SON staining , the structural integrity of nuclear speckles is not completely abolished ( Fig 1A and 1B ) . Our bioinformatic analyses confirmed the enrichment of RNA-binding properties within the RDPA proteome ( Figs 2A and S4A and S6 Table ) , a predictable feature due to the RNase III treatment step in our MS workflow . Interestingly , SLiMSearch data suggest that proteins with K/R-x ( 3 , 7 ) -K-x-K/R-K/R motif in IDRs may have a different nuclear distribution and be involved in different processes than proteins with IDRs with shorter K/R motifs , indicating a degree of specificity for a particular site of action . Our data are consistent with the recently published work in which the authors describe , among other fundamental findings , the effect of PIPs on the quantity , size and morphology of condensates in an in vitro system . Only 11 out of 183 RDPA proteins positively regulated by the presence of higher-order RNA contain the PIPs binding domains ( S5 Table ) , suggesting that these domains are not a major route of PIP2 association . Altogether our data indicate that the levels of nuclear PIP2 and higher-order RNA do indeed influence the formation or stability of BRD4 protein foci , presumably by

[ABSTRACT] Our work highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits , demonstrates gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals , and provides new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental , ecological , and evolutionary studies of this insect group . We then contrast chromatin accessibility in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females and identify distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development , including a large proportion of recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn morph determination . The Scarabaeinae , or true dung beetles , are a species-rich clade of insects recognized for their highly diversified nutrition-responsive development including that of cephalic horns-evolutionarily novel , secondary sexual weapons that exhibit remarkable intra- and interspecific variation . Phenotypic plasticity is thought to be an important driver of diversification and adaptation to environmental variation , yet the genomic mechanisms mediating plastic trait development and evolution remain poorly understood . Comparing these assemblies to those of seven other species across the order Coleoptera identifies evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis . We begin by presenting chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species in the tribe Onthophagini including Onthophagus taurus , O. sagittarius , and Digitonthophagus gazella . Here , we investigate the evolutionary basis for horns as well as other key dung beetle traits via comparative genomic and developmental assays . Binding motifs of known and new candidate transcription factors are enriched in these nutrition-responsive open chromatin regions .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] Comparing our findings on head horns to that of other diversified structures with established homology ( such as ventral appendages or thoracic beetle horns ) alongside other novel structures ( such as butterfly wing spots or firefly lanterns ) will be informative for understanding if the patterns of cis-regulatory evolution identified here are symptomatic for the early stages of morphological innovation in evolution . Chromatin configuration assays suggest alternative forms of intraspecific horn variation ( sexual dimorphism vs. nutritional plasticity ) are instructed by discrete regulatory architectures , a conclusion corroborated by two independent pieces of support : 1 ) largely distinct sex- and nutrition-responsive head horn OCRs ; and 2 ) a disproportionate amount of OCRs that are nutrition- , but not sex- , responsive and only found in the O. taurus genome . Lacking homology to other body parts may have promoted , permitted , or alternatively limited head horn development to the inclusion of novel regulatory interactions into gene networks due to the lack of pre-existing mechanisms that could be co-opted , and/or to minimize developmental constraint arising from pleiotropy . In contrast to legs , antennae , and mouthparts ( which are all serial homologs of ventral appendages ) and thoracic horns ( which have recently been identified as wing serial homologs ) , head horns appear to be unique elaborations of the dorsal head , and sufficiently individuated to have undergone remarkable diversification in shape , relative size , number , and in part , precise location . Future work comparing the overlap of sex- and nutrition-dependent changes in regulatory element activity of other body regions with varying degrees of sex and nutrition responsiveness will be critical to contextualizing these results and understanding how gene regulatory mechanisms evolve across disparate traits . These biological pathways are involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism , juvenile hormone production , and embryonic transcriptional regulation , which collectively are now motivating new hypotheses for how nutrition-responsive development may have evolved in this group of insects . In this study , we first used comparative genomics to identify coding and non-coding changes in dung beetles associated with metabolite and developmental regulation that are potentially underpinning the evolution of nutritionally plastic phenotypes in these species . One possible explanation for these findings may be linked to the idea that head horns lack obvious homology to other body parts in insects or non-insect hexapods . We then carried out an in-depth genomic and developmental analysis of one of these traits , head horns-secondary sexual weapons with an extreme degree of inter- and intraspecific variation . In other words , accessibility of putative cis-regulatory elements covaries extensively with sex and , in males , nutritional state , of which the latter set is disproportionally composed of recently evolved regulatory elements . Nutrition-responsive phenotypic plasticity is a ubiquitous property of living systems and important biological mechanism for adaptation and trait diversification .

[ABSTRACT] Using a cynomolgus monkey model of Lassa virus ( LASV ) infection reproducing the different outcomes of the disease , we performed histological and transcriptomic studies to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death . The pathogenesis of Lassa fever has not yet been fully deciphered , particularly as concerns the mechanisms determining whether acute infection is controlled or leads to catastrophic illness and death . Lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever , with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome . By contrast , the systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types , leading to infiltrations with macrophages and neutrophils and an excessive inflammatory response , is associated with a fatal outcome . However , subsequent viral tropism varies considerably with disease severity , with viral dissemination limited almost entirely to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever . These results provide new insight into early viral dynamics and the host response to LASV infection according to disease outcome .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] However , both strains are probably able to infected endothelial cells , as we previously showed that Mopeia virus , an Old-World arenavirus closely related to LASV , and AV LASV infect human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) with similar replication kinetics and high titers of virus released in the supernatant . We show here that the synthesis of mRNAs related to the type I IFN response , cytokines and chemokines , and to coagulation pathways is induced in both infected and bystander hepatocytes in Josiah-infected animals and that this expression is also observed in hepatocytes from AV-infected animals even without the infection of these cells . However , we think that this discrepancy with natural infection does not alter the course of infection , as lungs rapidly became targeted with the virus and similar pathological changes and viral tropism was reported in LASV-infected cynomolgus monkeys infected using aerosol route . The aim of this study was to characterize in more detail the dynamics of the pathogenesis and immune responses associated with survival or death from LF in a cynomolgus monkey model in which infection with AV LASV leads to non-lethal disease whereas infection with Josiah LASV results in death . The moderate but significant increase in cortisol levels in Josiah-infected animals probably reflects a stress response to infection and suggests that , despite the massive viral replication occurring in the adrenal glands , there are probably no major changes in the endocrine functions of these organs . The lower viral loads in the LN , spleen , and thymus measured after infection with AV than after infection with Josiah can not explain the lack of dissemination of AV LASV to non-lymphoid organs , which is probably due to the induction of innate and/or adaptive immunity . Moreover , our results suggest that events that take place in SLOs early during the course of infection may determine the later different host responses and the outcome of Lassa fever , either control of LASV and recovery or catastrophic illness and death . These results confirm that lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for LASV replication whatever the outcome of the disease , and that APCs-or at least macrophages-probably play a key role in the dissemination of LASV from the inoculation site . We show here that the draining lymph nodes are the first organ targeted by LASV after this early local replication , with infected cells detected in the subcortical sinus of ILNs close to the inoculation site at 2 DPI . The SMZ is an important area for the presentation of blood-driven antigens , and macrophages present in this area have been shown to be crucial for the early control of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV ) infection , another old-world arenavirus . However , differences in tropism were observed between LASV strains in MLN , with only macrophages infected by the AV strain whereas stromal cells-probably fibroblastic reticular cells ( FRC ) -and neutrophils were also found to contain Josiah LASV material . The higher viral load and more intense activation of gene sets related to immune activation in this area 11 days after Josiah infection than after AV infection suggest that the SMZ is severely affected during fatal LF . This is particularly true for the brain in Josiah-infected animals , in which the infection of endothelial cells may enable the virus to enter the brain and to replicate in specific cells , such as ependymocytes and pericytes , particularly in the meninges , subarachnoid space , and choroid plexus . Massive expression of type I response-related genes was observed in the kidneys in both groups of animals at 5 DPI , demonstrating that this activation was not due to LASV tropism for this organ as no infection was detected in this organ after AV infection . This finding is reminiscent of the observations made in mice infected with LCMV , in which preferential viral tropism for SMZ macrophages leads to

Our convergent results between mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cellular biology provide mechanistic evidence that many of the mis-localized proteins and dysregulated transcriptional events seen in multiple neurodegenerative diseases may in fact arise primarily from a primary upstream defect in Importin- β nuclear import . First , taking advantage of two novel mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration ( NemfR86S and NemfR487G ) that recapitulate many cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases , we find an Importin-β-specific nuclear import block . However , the question of whether these alterations represent a primary cause , or a downstream consequence of disease is unclear , and what upstream factors may account for these defects are unknown . Lastly , we show that even transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in our mouse models and in neurodegeneration . Second , we observe cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of multiple proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD , including TDP43 , Importin-β , RanGap1 , and Ran . These findings have critical implications for investigating how sporadic forms of neurodegeneration may arise from presently unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importin-β function . Here , we report four key findings that shed light on the upstream causal role of Importin-β-specific nuclear transport defects in disease onset . These findings are further supported by a pathological interaction between Importin-β and the mutant NEMFR86S protein in cytoplasmic accumulations . Third , we identify similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease . [ INTRODUCTION ] [ RESULTS ] [ DISCUSSION ] We have demonstrated that there is a direct impact of Importin-β nuclear import dysregulation on multiple phenotypes seen in neurodegeneration through the following : ( 1 ) NEMF-specific dysregulation of Importin-β nuclear import ( but not of Transportin-1 import ) , ( 2 ) mis-localization and aggregation of NEMF , TDP43 , Ran , RanGAP1 and Importin-β , ( 3 ) amyloid-like aggregation , ( 4 ) PLA cytoplasmic association between NEMF R86S and Importin-β , ( 5 ) cytoplasmic accumulation of NEMF , Importin-β , and TDP43 in Nemf mutant mouse spinal cord , ( 6 ) transient Importin-β-specific nuclear import blockage knockdown recapitulates these transcriptional alterations ( 7 ) and upregulation of Importin-β can partially rescue these transcriptional alterations . This ability to inhibit and reverse both physiological and deleterious phase transitions has been implicated in multiple forms of neurodegenerative diseases , wherein RNA-binding proteins or Prion-like domains are lost from the nucleus and accumulate in the cytoplasm [ 69-77 ] . Altogether , this suggests that Importin-β 's function as both a nuclear import receptor and cytoplasmic chaperone is disturbed in this NemfR86S model , wherein the protein is sequestered away from its typical function , and that we can recapitulate many of these in vivo alterations through transient Importin-β pharmacological impairment . The early onset of disease in the NemfR86S mutant mice indicates that the cytoplasmic accumulation of NEMF and TDP-43 may be a result of a greater propensity to mis-localize in the R86S variant when compared to the R487G , whether through direct or indirect mechanisms . However , the ability for Importin-β upregulation to rescue both Stmn2 and Apoe in our NemfR86S , even if partially suggests a divergence of pathology that can be mediated by both driving nuclear import as well as the disaggregating chaperone activity of Importin-β . The loss of Stmn2 transcript in our NemfR86S mouse model suggests either that Stmn2 is downregulated directly because of defects in nuclear import , that its down regulation is a result of the mis-localization of TDP-43 itself , or some combination of the two . It has been well described that PolyK tracts are known to act as nuclear and nucleolar localization sequences , whereas the 3'UTR sequences found in the GFP-Nonstop are unable to properly localize these proteins to the nucleus and will sequester in the cytoplasm . The divergence for the dysregulation of Apoe and Stmn2 suggests that these transcripts are more likely dysregulated through separate downstream pathways , with Stmn2 being dysregulated by defects in nuclear import and Apoe by other unknown mechanisms , non-specific to neuronal cells . Therefore , we can infer that the inability for NemfR86S MEFs to localize the GFP-Nonstop to the nucleus through their PolyK tracks results in their sequestration into cytoplasmic inclusions through these 3'UTR domains , whereas the GFP-PolyK and GFP-3X-NLS remain relatively diffuse . Using puromycylated nascent chains which disrupt the interaction of NEMF with the 60S ribosome , we were able to observe a similar lack of nucleolar targeting which was dependent on the ability for Importin-β to interact with its substrates . Furthermore , the inability for RQC substrates such as GFP-Nonstop and GFP-PolyK- ( AAA ) 10 to properly localize to the nucleus in the NemfR86S suggests that nuclear import mechanisms may work closely with protein degradation pathways . Nevertheless , our observations of pathological TDP-43 insoluble aggregates , TDP-43 missplicing events , and a downregulation of Stmn2 mRNA and protein after a nuclear import block indicates a direct causal [ METHODS",,1024,80,Missing abstract section|Missing discussion section,"Neurodegenerative diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTDFTLD ) , have been implicated in a number of cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative disease .

[ABSTRACT] The described temporal modulation of the phage epigenome is valuable for synthetic biology and fundamental research to comprehend phage infection mechanisms through the generation of mutants . This approach enables precise DNA targeting and seamless point mutation integration , exemplified by deactivating specific ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection . Our study utilizes the eukaryotic enzyme NgTET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications , facilitating Cas nuclease cleavage and enhancing mutagenesis efficiency . Furthermore , by temporally removing DNA modifications , we elucidated the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections without necessitating gene deletions . Our results present a strategy enabling the investigation of phage epigenome functions and streamlining the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications . However , phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through extensive DNA modifications like cytosine glycosylation , hindering mutagenesis efficiency . CRISPR-Cas systems offer a way to explore these mechanisms via site-specific phage mutagenesis . Lytic bacteriophages hold substantial promise in medical and biotechnological applications . Therefore a comprehensive understanding of phage infection mechanisms is crucial .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Consequently , a strategy analogous to that employed in the current study , in which NgTET was pre-expressed in order to generate a protein which is stable during phage infection and to ensure reduction of the abundance of phage DNA modifications , could be employed with recombination systems . Taken together , the field of bacteriophage epigenetics remains widely unexplored and , therefore , represents an intriguing subject for future research , providing the opportunity to gain profound insights into the ongoing arms race between bacteria and bacteriophages . Moreover , the phage mutagenesis efficiency of up to 6 % reported in this study , combined with the ONT-based high-throughput screening method , simplifies the detection of the point mutations within the phage genome , thereby reducing the need to screen large phage populations . To potentially increase the efficiency and rate of homologous recombination after Cas nuclease targeting of phage DNA , incorporating heterologous recombination systems into the mutagenesis strain on plasmid and pre-expressing the recombination proteins before the mutagenesis process could be beneficial . This approach avoids additional genomic changes associated with reporter gene insertion and the potential drawbacks on phage DNA packaging , allowing for the efficient , scarless introduction of point mutations into the phage genome . While the DNA accessibility is difficult to predict , the efficiency of the homologous recombination can be strongly limited due to the degradation of donor DNA plasmids at an early stage of infection by phage nucleases . The capability of NgTET to act on the precursors 5mdC and 5hmdC , generated by homologous of gene 42 , broadens the utility of our approach to engineer and to study phages carrying such DNA modifications . Such a recovery of DNA modifications in the subsequent phage generation highlights the major advantage of NgTET-coupled CRISPR-Cas mutagenesis over performing it with α/β-gt deletion or amber strains . More specifically , non-modified host DNA , including donor DNA plasmid for homologous recombination , is rapidly degraded by T4 phage nucleases at an early stage of the infection process . ARTs have been shown to be important for efficient host hijacking , which is achieved by introducing post-translation protein modifications such as ADP-ribosylation and RNAylation . Therefore , NgTET-mediated mutagenesis has the potential to become a valuable tool for studying such phages by facilitating their mutagenesis , and taking us a step closer to the generation of `` designer phages '' . Therefore , the presence of non-modified dC allows for efficient phage mutagenesis and also holds promise for studying the biological roles of various phage modifications or improving phage genome sequencing . While both numbers considerably differ , it is important to mention that while Cas nuclease targeting is an essential mutagenesis step , it is not the only factor that influences the success of the precise genome mutagenesis . The fact , that glycosylation happens directly on the DNA , and not on the nucleotide levels , allows NgTET , which also acts on DNA level , to oxidize 5hmdC into 5fdC and 5cadC , thereby preventing the glycosylation . Thus , we eliminate the need for pre-screening for the most efficient spacer , significantly facilitating the introduction of scarless point mutations at selected positions within the phage genome . Therefore , deleting the entire gene would not solely allow the study of ADP-ribosylation 's role , but might also have a more pronounced impact on the phage infection . The propagation of the resulting phage progeny in the strain without NgTET , allows the glycosyltransferases to introduce the glycosylations back and thereby recover the wild-type-like modifications of phage T4 DNA . Additional factors that might influence mutagenesis efficiency include the DNA accessibility at the intended mutagenesis site for Cas nucleases and the efficiency of homologous recombination following Cas targeting of phage DNA . In such deletion or amber strains , DNA glycosylations are permanently absent , making the phage consistently more susceptible to nucleases and thereby reducing its fitness . An important feature of the

This approach enables precise DNA targeting and seamless point mutation integration . Furthermore , by temporally removing DNA modifications we elucidated the effects of these modifications on T4 T4 infections without necessitating gene deletions .

[ABSTRACT] Bulky DNA lesions , such as those induced by UV light or the DNA-damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline oxide , act as transcriptional and replicational roadblocks and thus represent a major threat to cell metabolism . When located on the transcribed strand of active genes , these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair ( TC-NER ) , a yet incompletely understood NER sub-pathway . Z , repair by TC-NER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance reduced , leading to an increase in double-strand breaks . The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication .

[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This data can reflect either that RNAPIIs accumulate at the 5'-UTR due to defective TC-NER and recovery of transcription elongation , or that UV-dependent degradation of promoter-bound RNAPIIs-a critical pathway to avoid DNA-damage induced transcription stress -does not take place correctly in the absence of histone variant H2A . Z incorporation in the vicinity of RNAPII stalled at DNA lesions promotes efficient TC-NER repair by establishing a repair-favorable chromatin environment and , thus , preventing the accumulation of chromatin-bound RNAPII that could cause conflicts with the replication machinery in UV challenged cells ( S4 Fig ) . Z-enriched chromatin , which enhances DNA accessibility , could facilitate repair either by increasing the surface available for interaction with NER proteins or by promoting the action of specific factors that would fuel repair . Z incorporation by the SWR1 complex in response to UV damage , as Htz1 relative enrichment increases upon UV irradiation throughout RPB2 and that swr1Δ , htz1Δ and swr1Δ htz1Δ cells are equally sensitive to UV in a GG-NER deficient background . Even though further investigation would be required to discriminate between these possibilities , the persistence of chromatin-bound RNAPIIs is predicted to lead to increased TRCs which may challenge genome stability . Another example is provided by the chromatin-reorganizing FACT ( facilitates chromatin transcription ) complex , which is required for the resolution of TRCs that are mediated by R-loops and for proficient TC-NER in human cells . We found that recombination is greatly increased in a reporter system located in head-on orientation with respect to replication and sustained Rad52-foci are observed in UV-irradiated htz1Δ cells . Worthy of note , other TC-NER factors were shown to function both in promoting efficient repair on transcribed genes and in avoiding harmful collisions between the replication and transcription machineries . Z is required for efficient TC-NER and contributes to the prevention of UV-induced DSBs highlights the significance of DNA repair-optimized chromatin environment in maintaining genomic stability . Z is the only histone variant that is conserved from yeast to human and , while it is essential for proper mammalian development , it is not essential in budding yeast except in conditions requiring rapid transcriptional activation . Increased repair was observed at the repressed MFA2 promoter and relied on improved Gcn5-mediated histone H3 acetylation and recruitment of the Rad14 NER factor . Z in DSB repair seems to be conserved in higher eukaryotes , the mechanisms underlying the function of this histone variant in the maintenance of genome stability remain largely unresolved . For example , ELOF1 ( Elf1 in yeast ) not only promotes TC-NER but also protects cells against transcription-mediated replication stress upon DNA damage . Our ChIP analysis indicates that RNAPIIs remain bound at the 5'-UTR region but not in the RPB2 gene body in UV irradiated htz1Δ cells . Our results support a role for this histone variant both in the regulation of RNAPII occupancy and TC-NER repair efficiency upon UV irradiation . Stalling of elongating RNAPII at DNA damage sites may lead to nucleosome-free regions that could represent binding sites for SWR1 , leading to the incorporation of H2A . The SWR1 remodeling complex has been shown to bind nucleosome-free DNA and the adjoining nucleosome core particle , enabling discrimination of gene promoters over gene bodies . These results are consistent with the idea that TC-NER defects and persistent stalled RNAPII represent a major barrier to replication fork progression . Z to NTS repair , as GG-NER on NTS of active genes has been shown to depend on Rad7-Rad16-mediated Gcn5 recruitment and H3 acetylation . Z incorporation may also improve the DNA damage signaling or destabilize RNAPII binding by promoting post-translational modifications on histones or other proteins . The latter would imply a direct role for this histone variant in the recruitment of the factors involved in UV-induced RNAPII degradation . Z histone variant had not been linked to TC-NER so far , and to our knowledge only one

[ABSTRACT] Despite there being highly variable regulatory architecture , this observation was robust across tissues and genetic backgrounds , suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence and yielding new insights into cis and trans regulatory evolution . To address this question , we analyzed gene expression in the midgut , hindgut , and Malpighian tubule as well as microbiome composition in the two gut tissues in four Drosophila melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from two divergent populations : one from the derived , European range and one from the ancestral , African range . This gene expression variation is context dependent , with differences in regulatory architecture often associated with intrinsic and environmental factors , and is modulated by regulatory elements that can act in cis ( linked ) or in trans ( unlinked ) relative to the genes they affect . An examination of allele specific expression revealed that , while both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes expressed differentially between populations than genes with conserved expression , trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects . So far , little is known about how this genetic variation affects the evolution of regulatory architecture among closely related tissues during population divergence . Tissue-specific effects were typically stronger than genetic background-specific effects , although the two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules . In both the transcriptome and microbiome data , we detected extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects , including effects of genetic background on overall tissue specificity . The pervasiveness of gene expression variation and its contribution to phenotypic variation and evolution is well known .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] When we examined divergence in gene expression and phenotypic dominance ( i. e. the cumulative differences in each trait across all analyzed genes ) , we found that divergence was higher among than within tissues ( Figs 2C and 3D ) , suggesting that although both are pervasive , tissue-specific effects outnumber or are larger than genetic background-specific effects , and these effects may be magnified when considering the phenotypic dominance of gene expression , as our findings suggest that it is much less conserved than expression itself . However , we should note that the tissues we examined in this study , and the midgut in particular , are known to be regionalized [ 37-38 , 40 ] with an estimated 22 , 4 , and 5 distinct cell types currently described in the midgut , hindgut , and Malpighian tubules , respectively [ 49-50 ] ; therefore , it is possible that we may have missed some of the more subtle differences in gene regulation that occur among individual regions or cell types . The endosymbiont Wolbachia , which is known to affect microbiome composition but is not present in the gut lumen , was predominant in all of our samples ( S9 Fig ) but we did not detect the very common Lactobacillus ( Fig 6 ) , which suggests that physical abundance within the gut may not be predictive of metabolic activity levels and some bacterial community members may be more or less active than predicted by their physical abundance . Previous studies using F1 hybrids in Drosophila have found that genetic background and body part or tissue [ 21-22 , 28 ] can have large effects on regulatory architecture ; however , to our knowledge , this is the first study examining highly spatially and functionally proximate tissues that not only communicate with each other but also functionally and physically interact . The context-dependent nature of this finding suggests that this bias may be driven by one or several trans factors affecting the expression of multiple genes in individual tissues and genetic backgrounds , which underscores the importance of taking genetic background and tissue into account when attempting to identify general patterns and trends in gene expression and its regulation . Using transcriptome data from parental and F1 hybrid D. melanogaster strains from an ancestral and a derived population in the midgut , hindgut and Malpighian tubule , we found that both the genetic basis of expression variation ( i. e. cis versus trans ) and the mode of expression inheritance ( i. e. dominant versus additive ) were highly tissue- and genetic background-specific ( Figs 3 and 4 , Table 1 ) . Similar to our findings for the genetic basis of expression variation , the mode of expression inheritance , and phenotypic dominance ( Figs 3-5 ) , we detected significant effects of tissue and genetic background on bacterial community composition in our microbiome analysis , although the detected genetic background effects did not appear to explain host gene expression variation ( Figs 6 , 7 , and S11 ) . Indeed , we found that genes with trans and cis effects were more tissue-specific than genes with no differential expression regulation ( Fig 5 ) , suggesting that regulatory changes between diverged populations are often tissue-specific , which is likely driven by spatial fine-tuning of gene expression . In contrast , in our dataset the ancestral ZI418 genetic background showed the highest tissue ( i. e. spatial ) gene expression specificity ( Fig 5A ) ; however , it is possible that overall changes in gene expression specificity driven by adaptation are only detectable at

[ABSTRACT] We then apply our model using data on Alpha variant infections in the UK , dating the first Alpha infection at ( median ) August 21 , 2020 ( 95 % interpercentile range across retained simulations ( IPR ) : July 23-September 5 , 2020 ) . Our population dynamics-based modelling framework is generic and flexible , and thus can be applied to estimate the starting time of outbreaks in contexts other than COVID-19 . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic , previous studies have estimated dates of emergence ( e. g. , first human SARS-CoV-2 infection , emergence of the Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant ) using mainly genomic data . While the first infection of an emerging disease is often unknown , information on early cases can be used to date it . Here , we extend this approach to use a larger set of early reported cases to estimate the delay from first infection to the Nth case . Next , we apply our model to data on COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before mid-January 2020 . Another dating attempt used a stochastic population dynamics approach and the date of the first reported case . We date the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan at ( median ) November 28 , 2019 . Our results fall within ranges previously estimated by studies relying on genomic data . We first validate our framework by running our model on simulated data .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Second , our model requires early estimates of the distributions for key epidemiological indicators such as the mean number of secondary infections , the secondary infection generation time , the probability of case detection and the incubation period , which depend themselves on the quality of early observed data and may not be available for new emerging infectious diseases . This may not reflect early epidemic dynamics , where public outbreak alerts may provoke , on the one hand , an increase in testing efforts and thus , rapid changes in the probability of detection and , on the other hand , changes in individual behaviors that may impact the probability of disease transmission and thus , the expected number of secondary infections . For instance , our approach shows that early SARS-CoV-2 infections of the transmission chain that was first detected at Wuhan 's Huanan market remained undetected for between about a week and three weeks before the first case of symptomatic COVID-19 was observed and reported . Quantifying the time that emerging epidemics remain undetected before detecting the first cases is particularly important in the context of emergent pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 , where very early cases may remain unidentified , especially if a high proportion of the infections are asymptomatic . Here , we built our model in a parsimonious , generic and flexible manner intended to be applied to contexts other than COVID-19 , provided that key epidemiological parameters are known and transmission chains arise from a single infectious individual . Next , we apply our model to data on the early COVID-19 cases in Wuhan , estimating the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection around November 28 ( 95 % IPR : Nov 2-Dec 9 ) , 2019 , and not earlier than September 26 , 2019 . This assumption may reduce the time elapsed between the first infection and the first detection or increase its variance , in comparison to ignoring super-spreading by considering other distributions ( e. g. Poisson ) or by ignoring individual heterogeneity in infectiousness , as well as by using deterministic approaches . On the other hand , we find that the main model parameters ( expected number of secondary infections , R , and probability of detection , pdetect ) have a greater impact on the model outcomes : as expected , both higher transmissibility and higher detection shorten the time between emergence and N detected infections . In particular , it can be challenging to estimate the probability of case detection ( or ascertainment rate ) during early stages of an emergent infectious diseases , and its value may vary between countries . Early Wuhan COVID-19 cases with symptoms onset before December 30 ( the day of issue of the emergency notice from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission ) were diagnosed clinically before tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were available . Assuming an origin of the pandemic in China , claims of large early circulation outside of China ( e. g. and references therein ) would be therefore extraordinary , and require extraordinary evidence , excluding potential false positives by setting appropriate controls . Third , our methods rely on the hypothesis that by the time an infection is detected , a sustained epidemic is ongoing , and all cases contained in the data set belong to the same transmission tree . Further developments of our model need to include genomic data on top of case data , as it is likely that sequencing will remain as intensive for other infectious diseases as it has been for COVID-19 . This may also be a limitation in the context of epidemics emerging from multiple spillover events , such as has been concluded by relying on data on the early SARS-CoV-2 lineages . We estimate the date of emergence of an

[ABSTRACT] Incorporating natural chromosome lengths , the model accurately recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast , and can be adapted to nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets of other organisms . Mechanisms that ensure stable homolog alignment in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes have remained elusive , but rapid chromosome movements appear to play a role in the process . Apart from homolog attraction , provided by early intermediates of homologous recombination , dissociation of non-homologous associations also appears to contribute to homolog pairing , as suggested by the detection of stable non-homologous chromosome associations in pairing-defective mutants . Dissociation of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes may contribute to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited nuclear area thus creating preconditions for close-range homolog attraction . Chromosome number and size as well as movement velocity and repulsive forces are identified as key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing in addition to homolog attraction . The model simulates unidirectional chromosome movements , as well as collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces arising from close-range physical interactions . During meiosis , pairing of homologous chromosomes ( homologs ) ensures the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells , a prerequisite for sexual reproduction . Here , we have developed an agent-based model for homolog pairing derived from the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble . Pairing during meiotic prophase I facilitates crossover recombination and homolog segregation during the ensuing reductional cell division .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Accordingly , the frequency of non-homologous interactions is reduced and crowding of homologous chromosomes into the same nuclear area occurs at low frequencies when chromosomes are present in lower numbers , exhibit smaller sizes or fail to achieve unidirectional movement due to disturbance by Brownian motion . To explore contributions to the pairing process of the entire nuclear chromosome ensemble , we have developed an agent-based mathematical model derived from first principles that takes into account both attractive forces between homologs and dissociative forces between non-homologous chromosomes ( see Methods section ) . Importantly , involvement of a single protein complex in homologous strand exchange and dissociation of non-homologous chromosome interactions is consistent with both forces acting upon the same molecular intermediate , most likely displacement loops between DNA segments with extensive or limited sequence similarity , respectively . In summary , the modeling approach developed here suggests that homolog pairing is achieved by two mechanistically distinct , yet temporally coinciding processes : Homologs become confined to a nuclear area due to dissociation of interactions with the entire non-homologous chromosome set achieved via a repulsive force . Other extensions of our model might include chromosome-size dependent velocities , and temporary changes in effective nuclear volume , as in the case of directed chromosome movements during the horsetail stage in S. pombe where the entire chromosome complement temporarily becomes confined to small regions within the nuclear volume . The agent-based modeling framework developed here is new to chromosome dynamics but has been useful in modeling other multicomponent systems that involve attractive and repulsive forces , ranging from molecular to macroscopic components [ 20 , 21 , 26 , 65-75 ] . As an example , we have already started exploring the effect of nucleus size on pairing dynamics , indicating that a smaller nuclear area accelerates pairing likely because each chromosome interacts with several non-homologous neighbors at the same time . While pronounced contributions of a dissociative/repulsive force to homolog pairing may appear counter-intuitive , several mutant phenotypes are consistent with the existence of molecular processes that contribute to the dissociation of non-homologous interactions , which in the model are captured as a repulsive force . Our model indicates that chromosome movements must occur above a certain velocity threshold , likely determined by the number of chromosomes and the dimensions of the nucleus , providing a potential reason why chromosomes move at distinct speeds in different organisms . Earlier modeling approaches have focused on interactions between individual homologs which likely play an important role in completion of the pairing process , but they have not considered the effects of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes [ 18 , 20-22 ] . This has already allowed us to predict different sensitivities to translation velocity thresholds of small , medium-sized , and very large chromosomes that would have eluded a population-based approach ( see Fig 6B ) . Accordingly , for the current settings , homolog pairing levels and/or kinetics are disproportionately increased when chromosomes are initially separated by less than 4 μm ( Fig 4 ) , when chromosome size exceeds 400 kbp ( Fig 5 ) , and when chromosome velocity is increased from 210 nm/s to 240 nm/s ( Fig 6 ) . In future work , our model could be used to explore , e. g. , how pairing dynamics are affected by different nucleus sizes and shapes , or by a nucleus represented by a 3-dimensional volume rather than a 2 dimensional surface area . For example , meiosis in the Indian muntjac involves only three very large homolog pairs , whereas in some insects and plants between 200 and 600 homolog pairs need to complete pairing . The Hop2/Mnd1 complex also mediates homologous strand exchange , yet non-homologous chromosome associations

[ABSTRACT] Interestingly , miR-34 triple-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development , but the lack of miR-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds . DNA damage by camptothecin led to p53-dependent induction of miR-34 genes , while miR-34a mutants were adult-viable and had normal DNA damage-induced apoptosis . Nevertheless , miR-34a-/- compound mutants with a gain-of-function tp53R217H/ R217H or tp53-/- mutants were more cancer-prone than tp53 mutants alone , confirming the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a . Through transcriptomic comparisons at 28 hours post-fertilization ( hpf ) , we characterized DNA damage-induced transcription , and at 8 , 28 and 72 hpf we determined potential miR-34a-regulated genes . Overexpression of miR-34a suppressed its reporter mRNA , but not p53 target induction , and sensitized injected embryos to camptothecin but not to γ-irradiation . At 72 hpf , loss of miR-34a enhanced erythrocyte levels and up-regulated myb-positive hematopoietic stem cells . Zebrafish miR-34a and miR-34b/c have similar expression timing in development , but miR-34a is more abundant . Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by inherited TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations . miR-34 genes are highly conserved and syntenic between zebrafish and humans . MicroRNA miR-34a is a p53 target and modifier gene .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The triple knock-out miR-34 study in mice showed no increased tumor incidence in these animals under normal conditions nor upon Myc oncogene expression , but the authors contended that in other tumor types the situation could be different based on higher miR-34 gene levels in the corresponding tissues . Although we were not able to suppress increased myb labeling with artificial miR-34a over-expression likely due to miRNA mimic limitations , we believe that these hematopoiesis-related findings are very significant and future transgenic/knock-in methods will help verify them . A recent study questioned the tumor suppressor function of miR-34a due to evidence that miR-34a is not preferentially repressed or mutated in cancer samples ; its loss does not provide a proliferative advantage and only extreme overexpression can block proliferation . Given the observed up-regulation of erythrocyte markers in miR-34a mutant zebrafish larvae and an actual erythrocyte expansion in concert with the likely underlying increase in myb-positive stem cell numbers , we believe that miR-34a negatively regulates levels of hematopoietic stem cells . This result is consistent with previous miR-34a overexpression studies which reported increased mitotic catastrophe rates and aberrant DNA repair , as well as sensitization of lung cancer cells and tumors toward irradiation via inhibition of RAD51 . miR-34a mimic-injected embryos may experience a higher cumulative amount of cell death over the course of continuous DNA damage due to CPT treatment than after a rapid short burst of irradiation , after which the embryo can repair some of the DNA damage . The study of intestinal tumorigenesis due to an APCMin mutation in mice showed that inactivation of all three miR-34 genes was required to observe significantly more rapid mortalities , as well as dramatically altered tumor properties . Embryos overexpressing miR-34a were much more sensitive to topoisomerase inhibition ( CPT treatment ) in terms of morphological defects and earlier kinetics of apoptosis induction than control-injected embryos , whereas after gamma irradiation ( IR ) , both types of embryos responded similarly . We expression-profiled wild-type and miR-34a deficient samples at 8 , 28 and 72 hpf developmental stages and identified varying numbers of DEGs , but no statistically significant de-repression of predicted miR-34 targets was observed . Since we maintained miR-34a-/- mutants as an independent homozygous line to prevent maternal contributions of miR-34a , our wild-type samples are not from sibling embryos and can potentially be somewhat genetically divergent . Although the extent of miR-34a overexpression was well above the physiological range ( 100 to 200-fold on average ) , this experiment showed that miR-34a does not significantly influence p53 target genes in zebrafish . Double inactivation of p53 and miR-34a in intestinal epithelial cells exacerbated cancer burden in a chemically-induced colorectal cancer mouse model compared to any other genotype , a finding fully consistent with the results reported here . The HSC marker ( runx1 , myb ) transcript levels were not globally increased in miR-34a deficient mutants , but the focused analysis of myb staining in the hematopoietic tissues showed an increase in its HSC labeling intensity at the 3 dpf larval stage . Another study of Kras-mediated lung oncogenesis showed that the triple miR-34 knock-out dramatically increased the rate of cancer development and that miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes had differential effects in multiple assays . One caveat to these results is that tp53-/- fish are in a different background strain ( CG1 ) than the miR-34a-/- zebrafish ( casper ) , which does not allow for the elimination of background-dependent effects on tumor susceptibility . In embryonic samples , we did not obtain evidence to support such regulation of wild-type tp53 by miR-34a , but we ca n't exclude it at other stages and in missense p53 mutants . Taken together , our results show multiple nuanced but important roles for miR-34a in p53-mediated responses to DNA damage and tumour suppression as well as independent roles in metabolic regulation and blood development .

Further analyses reveal that XOL-1 is responsible for regulating the timing of initiation of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes , and the appropriate expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites . These findings demonstrate that XOL-1 plays an important role as a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes , and that MET-2 acts as a downstream effector of XOL-1 activity in hermaphrodites . XOL-1 activity is known to be critical for the proper development of C. elegans males , but its low expression was considered to be of minimal importance in the development of hermaphrodite embryos . Expression of xol-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes and autosomes , which differs between XX hermaphrodites and XO males . Our study reveals that XOL-1 plays an important role as a regulator of developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis . We found that xol-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape . Sex determination in the nematode C. elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis . In males , xol-1 is highly expressed and in hermaphrodites , xol-1 is expressed at very low levels . Some of these effects of the loss of xol-1 gene were reversed by the loss of met-2 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The data in this paper also demonstrates that mutations in met-2 are able to reverse some of the phenotypes we have observed in xol-1 mutant embryos , including the precocious loading of the DCC complex onto the X chromosomes ( Fig 3A and 3E ) , and the acceleration of the timeline of embryonic cell divisions ( Fig 2A and 2C ) . This suggests that XOL-1 is a recently evolved gene within the Caenorhabditis genus , where it has assumed the role of the master regulator of sex determination , dosage compensation and as our data shows , a novel regulator that is responsible for controlling the timing of embryonic development . Since there is a distinct lack of any mechanistic insight into how XOL-1 may be regulating any of its downstream targets , including the SDC proteins , it is also difficult to determine whether met-2 is regulated directly or indirectly by XOL-1 . Though the xol-1 gene has very little nucleotide and protein sequence homology with any non-nematode genes , the structure of XOL-1 resolved by x-ray crystallography revealed that it has significant structural homology to GHMP kinase family members . This robustness in embryonic development has been described before in other organisms , where quite significant disruptions in early embryogenesis can be compensated for at later stages resulting in perfectly viable larvae and adults . Even between these two closely related species , the protein sequence similarity was found to be low , though there was significant conservation in the protein domains believed to be important for its putative GHMP kinase activity . Beyond these putative mechanistic insights derived from this structural study of XOL-1 , there is not much evidence that sheds light on how XOL-1 may be repressing the activity of the SDC proteins . One of these is that XOL-1 is regulating the activity of the SDC proteins at the level of protein-protein interactions or post-translational modifications , which is compatible with its current designation as a putative GHMP kinase . In addition , we see that most of the significant transcriptional differences in xol-1 vs WT in early embryos are resolved by the time the worms reach L1 larval stage ( Fig 1A , 1B ) . Despite the significant difference in the timeline of cell division and broad disruption in the timeline of initiation of dosage compensation and sex determination pathways , the xol-1 embryos show no significant embryonic or larval lethality ( Fig 1D ) . The authors of this study speculated that with some conformational changes XOL-1 may be able to bind polynucleotide substrates , due to sub-domain specific homology to RNA/DNA-binding proteins . noted particular structural similarity between RNA-binding protein domains and C-terminal domains of GHMP kinases such as XOL-1 , raising another possible mechanism of XOL-1 action through the modulation of mRNA translation following RNA-binding . There are no known hormonal signaling pathways that have been shown to be important in regulating C. elegans embryogenesis , though some hormones are involved in regulating developmental timing at larval stages . speculated that XOL-1 may be similar in its mechanism to GAL3p , a GHMP kinase family member in S. cerevisiae , that is known to act as a transcriptional inducer of GAL genes . Given this , it is likely that the delay in the loading of the DCC complex seen in met-2 ; xol-1 mutants is due to the MET-2-mediated change in timing of loss of developmental plasticity . A second possibility arises from the assumption that XOL-1 may able to bind DNA sequences after a conformational change and that it may be able to directly regulate transcription of genes . Furthermore , SDC-2 protein levels were also not significantly higher in xol-1 embryos ( S2C Fig ) , suggesting that XOL-1 also

[ABSTRACT] A key strength of MGSurvE is that it allows important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for , namely : i ) resources required by mosquitoes ( e. g. , food sources and aquatic breeding sites ) can be explicitly distributed through a landscape , ii ) movement of mosquitoes may depend on their sex , the current state of their gonotrophic cycle ( if female ) and resource attractiveness , and iii ) traps may differ in their attractiveness profile . For these projects , monitoring will be required to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites , and the emergence of alternative alleles , such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes , within intervention sites . Example MGSurvE analyses are presented to demonstrate optimal trap placement for : i ) an Aedes aegypti population in a suburban landscape in Queensland , Australia , and ii ) an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé , São Tomé and Príncipe . To this end , we present MGSurvE ( Mosquito Gene SurveillancE ) : a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized . This entails the need to distribute mosquito traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible-ideally when remediation is still viable . Additionally , insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insecticide-resistance alleles for which there is also a need to detect as quickly as possible . Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing . Especially applicable are mosquito gene drive projects , the potential scale of which leads monitoring to be a significant cost driver . MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance . Further documentation and use examples are provided in project 's documentation .

[ABSTRACT] Using the BpV genome as a reference , we assembled a near-complete 190 kbp draft genome encoding all hallmark prasinovirus genes , as well as two additional incomplete assemblies of closely related but distinct viruses from RCC257 , and three similar draft viral genomes from RCC24 , which we collectively call SsVs . Instead , numerous contigs in assemblies from both RCC24 and RCC257 were closely related to prasinoviruses infecting the green algae Ostreococcus lucimarinus , Bathycoccus prasinos , and Micromonas pusilla ( OlV , BpV , and MpV , respectively ) . We generated both amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data from S. scintillans strains RCC257 and RCC24 , but were unable to detect any sequences from known lineages of endosymbiotic bacteria . The genus was named based on the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum , however , like most such endosymbionts neither the identity nor functional association with its host were known . Interestingly , transmission electron microscopy also revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar the morphology and size of the endosymbiont originally reported in S. scintillans . A multi-gene tree showed the three SsV genome types branched within highly supported clades with each of BpV2 , OlVs , and MpVs , respectively . Overall , we conclude that S. scintillans currently does not harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium , but is associated with giant viruses . The absence of endobacteria was further verified with FISH analyses . Symbiomonas scintillans Guillou et Chrétiennot-Dinet , 1999 is a tiny ( 1 . 4 μm ) heterotrophic microbial eukaryote .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] Some resistant hosts have been observed to produce infective viruses with nearly undetectable low transcription and without typical lytic events , reminiscent of the fact that no prasinovirus reads and hallmark genes were detected in our RCC257 transcriptome data ( and also to Herpesvirale , another dsDNA virus distantly related to NCLDVs ) . Both these cases illustrate how difficult it can be to identify the nature of an intracellular symbiont , suggesting that more studies on the diversity of symbioses in heterotrophic nano- or pico-flagellates should yield more such surprises and taxonomic re-assignments of many symbionts will also follow . When sequences that had no taxonomic affiliation in WGA data were removed , a scaffold assigned to Marinobacter salinus had the third highest coverage up to x95 , 000 ( N50 = 116K ) , after the ones assigned to Oomycota ( N50 = 276 ) and Cafeteria roenbergensis ( up to x102 , 851 coverage , N60 = 63K ) , a species closely related to S. scintillans ( S2 Dataset ) . To examine the possibility that virophages are involved in the host-virus dynamic , we searched for virophage genes or virophage-like elements ( VLEs ) in the initial assembly without taxonomically filtering scaffolds , due to the nature of some virophage genes being recombinant , horizontally transferred , or homologs that are shared with cellular organisms or transposable elements ( i. e. , polintons ) , and NCLDVs . in addition to Marinovum algicola and a member of Phycisphaeraceae , but no known endosymbiotic lineages nor any draft bacterial genomes with `` symbiotic features '' such as small genome size , AT-rich content , or rapid sequence evolution could be identified in any of these data . Another complication with the last possibility is in how to explain the long-term persistence of viruses in these cultures , in particular as it must have been followed after 20 years by a sudden loss of viruses ( RCC257-late ) or the death of the strain ( RCC24 ) . Because our experimental design was to identify endobacteria and because there is no longer any living host-virus pair in culture , experiments such as infection assays , virus-targeted FISH or PCRs , or thin-section TEM to show virus particles within the cells are not possible . Notably , both Monkeypox ( MPXV ) and Cucumber mosaic viruses ( CMV ) were named after their first isolation from Macaca fascicularis ( macaque monkeys ) and Cucumis sativus ( cucumbers ) , respectively , but MPXV was subsequently reported to infect other hosts including humans and squirrels ( for MPXV ) ( reviewed in ) , and CMV in legumes and ornamental plants . Given the original description of this taxon suggested these symbionts were bacterial , we first searched for bacterial reads assigned to well-known endosymbiotic lineages such as Rickettsiales , Holosporales , or Chlamydiae in all the analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data . Along with other common prasinovirus proteins involved in carbohydrate synthesis ( i. e. , dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase , and five glycosyltransferases ) , we also detected ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase in RCC257 BpV-vMAG ( S1 Dataset ) , which was unique to BIIV-2 and -3 among prasinoviruses . When viral-subset-scaffolds were re-assembled and further scaffolded using a reference-guide approach , we recovered three viral metagenomically assembled genomes ( vMAGs ) related to the prasinovirus genera , Bathycoccus prasinos virus 2 ( BpV2 ) , Ostreococcus lucimarinus virus 1 ( OlV1 ) , and Micromonas pusilla virus Pl1 ( MpV_Pl1 ) . In retrospect , many of these TEMs actually resemble giant virus particles , and we observed an extracellular VLP that falls within a similar size range and resembles a shape of the reported endobacteria (

[ABSTRACT] We show here that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay , a cellular mechanism which eliminates mRNAs with premature termination codons , underlies loss of mutant protein from two independent LMOD2 disease-causing mutations . Furthermore , we generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides that obstruct deposition of the exon junction complex , preventing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of mutant LMOD2 transcripts , thereby restoring mutant protein expression . The leiomodin ( Lmod ) family of actin-binding proteins play a critical role in muscle function , highlighted by the fact that mutations in all three family members ( LMOD1-3 ) result in human myopathies . Most of the disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense , or frameshift , mutations predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins . Our investigation lays the initial groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in LMOD-linked myopathies . However , in nearly all cases of disease , little to no LMOD protein is expressed . Mutations in the cardiac predominant isoform , LMOD2 lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Supporting this conclusion , transgenic mice expressing the homologous mutation ( p. W405 * ) to that first discovered to cause disease in humans ( p. W398 * ) live significantly longer than Lmod2 knockout mice , but display dilated cardiomyopathy and die prematurely as adults ( Iwanski et al. , in preparation ) . Furthermore , introduction of mouse GFP-Lmod2 with a mutation ( W405 * ) homologous to the W398 * mutation found in the first patient identified ( generated from cDNA so it is not susceptible to degradation due to NMD ) partially restores cardiac morphology and function in Lmod2 KO mice . Thus , while recovery of mutant protein expression , due to successful inhibition of NMD , is predicted to improve cardiac function and could potentially provide the patient with additional time to receive other therapies or a cardiac transplant , it is not expected to provide a cure since it is likely that fully-functional protein is not made . While the L415Vfs * 108 mutation did not result in a significant decrease in mutant protein when expressed from the minigene construct ( ~90 % of wild type levels ) , when expressed from the CDS construct the mutation results in an increase in protein levels ( ~130 % of wild type ) suggesting that the mutant protein , which contains 108 random residues C-terminal to valine 415 , is more stable than wild type LMOD2 . Here we further show the p. W398 * mutation , and an additional unstudied mutation ( p. R513 * ) , result in very little mutant LMOD2 protein expression when expressed from gene constructs in a human cell line , while another unstudied mutation ( p. V415fs * 108 ) does not significantly decrease mutant protein levels . Various strategies have been utilized to inhibit NMD including RNA interference to knock down the expression of NMD factors , the use of small molecule inhibitors to directly disrupt the function of NMD factors or indirectly affect cellular function and steric-blocking oligonucleotides to block the binding of the EJC . Thus , we chose to employ steric-blocking oligonucleotides ( SBOs ) to take advantage of the specificity of Watson-Crick base pairing with the goal of only targeting the LMOD2 transcript by blocking a single EJC binding site downstream of the PTC . First , the mutations only result in a large decrease in protein levels when expressed from constructs containing an intron , indicating that significant loss of mutant protein is not due to a defect at the level of the protein . Interestingly , a patient homozygous for the latter mutation displayed the latest onset of disease to date , presenting at 9 months of age , revealing a potential correlation between mutant LMOD2 protein levels and severity of DCM . All of the LMOD2 disease-causing mutations ( should they be expressed ) result in proteins missing varying degrees of their C-termini , which includes one of the three known actin-binding sites of LMOD2 . Thus , treatment with an SBO that inhibits NMD in combination with a drug that promotes translation of the full-length protein could result in rescue of cardiac function in patients with certain mutations in LMOD2 . By analyzing explanted hearts we previously found that two of the mutations ( p. W398 * and c. 273+1G > A * ) result in a lack of full-length or mutant protein expression . This study was performed in a human cell line that does not express detectable levels of LMOD2 to facilitate analysis of LMOD2 gene constructs containing patient mutations . Fourth , inhibition of a known mechanism through which NMD functions ( the presence of an exon junction complex downstream of a premature termination codon ) partially recovers mutant protein levels . To date , four distinct LMOD2 mutations have been discovered in individuals from five separate families that all present with early onset dilated cardiomyopathy [ 7-11 ] . In this study we developed an experimental system to directly test the

[ABSTRACT] In ApoE2 , proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and the membrane , including oxidative phosphorylation complexes , had a similar increase in degradation which suggests coordinated replacement of the entire organelle . In the brain , we found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3 . In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues . Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology . In ApoE4 mice , lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggests that dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy is reducing protein quality . To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk , we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing a human ApoE gene ( isoform 2 , 3 , or 4 ) . Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer 's disease with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3 . We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of ~2700 ontologies . The regulation of each protein 's homeostasis is observed by measuring turnover rate and abundance for that protein .
[INTRODUCTION]

[DISCUSSION] Future work investigating ApoE-dependent modification of region-specific lipid transport or protein-protein interactions will be necessary to elucidate the key initiating variables causing these proteostatic changes . Our findings present in vivo evidence that harmonizes with existing literature , linking brain ApoE4-dependent changes in endosomal trafficking , autophagy , proteasome activity , and lower mitochondrial quality . Concurrently , our data suggests that ApoE2 enhances brain mitochondrial health by increasing turnover in tandem with a corresponding increase in proteolysis capacity in the brain ( Fig 6 ) . In this study , we demonstrated how combining protein abundance and turnover rate unveils the cellular regulation of protein synthesis and degradation . Utilizing proteomics data , we compared ontology-level variations due to ApoE genotypes in healthy adult mice .

[ABSTRACT] We validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue , demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system , and showed simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes . To expand tissue-specific CRISPR to this powerful model system , here we present a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRISPR-TRiM ) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons , muscles , and glial cells . Lastly , we found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ . Thus , we have successfully developed an NMJ CRISPR mutagenesis approach which we used to reveal genes important for NMJ structural plasticity . Furthermore , we demonstrate that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling . However , this approach has not been successfully applied to most Drosophila tissues , including the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) . We used CRISPR-TRiM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance . Tissue-specific gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful approach for characterizing gene functions during development .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] To increase the success rate of gRNAs , we recommend the following guidelines : ( 1 ) Select target sequences predicted to have high efficiency scores by multiple experimentally validated algorithms [ 73 , 79-82 ] ; ( 2 ) Choose two gRNAs for each gene of interest , targeting the earlier part of the coding sequence to increase the possibility of early truncations ; ( 3 ) Avoid target sequences that are subject to frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms , which can render gRNAs ineffective ; ( 4 ) Select Cas9 cut sites near sequences that encode conserved amino acid residues to increase the chance of LOF mutations ; ( 5 ) Construct gRNAs in high-efficiency expression vectors such as pAC-U63-gRNA2 . The ESCRT complex is known to play diverse roles in different cellular contexts , including sorting of endosomal proteins [ 50 , 83-87 ] , biogenesis of MVBs [ 88-91 ] , biogenesis of exosome and extracellular vesicles , membrane repair [ 93-96 ] , autophagy [ 97-101 ] and cytokinesis . Alternatively , ESCRT-III is required for more molecular processes than those involving ESCRT-I [ 31 , 113-115 ] , so that the additional defects caused by shrb LOF counteract the effects of receptor accumulation and dampen the overall membrane accumulation at the axon terminal . Second , because mutagenesis occurs individually in each cell and could yield different degrees of LOF , CRISPR-TRiM has the potential to reveal both weak and strong LOF phenotypes of the gene of interest ( GOI ) using a single gRNA transgene . Because ESCRT plays a general role in sorting signaling receptors to ILVs of MVBs for subsequent delivery to lysosomes , in the absence of ESCRT , ligand-bound BMP receptors may be more stable and thus can sustain the signaling longer , as has been shown for TGF-β receptors . However , our data suggest that EV loss and satellite bouton overgrowth are two uncorrelated defects : The NMJs that showed complete or near complete loss of EVs in shrb KO still display the full spectrum of satellite bouton phenotypes ( Fig 4H and 4I ) . In addition , global gbb KD in ESCRT LOF completely suppressed satellite bouton formation but had no impact on EV release , further confirming that the EV loss and satellite bouton overgrowth are controlled by two separate pathways . Unlike Gal4-dependent CRISPR strategies , the tissue-specific Cas9s in our CRISPR-TRiM method can be used orthogonally with binary expression systems , as exemplified by simultaneous TSG101 KO in neurons and tissue-specific KD of gbb . In this study , by examining shrb and TSG101 KO , we uncovered several aspects of NMJ morphogenesis controlled by the ESCRT pathway , namely EV biogenesis , satellite bouton growth , and intra-axonal membrane trafficking . First , it is relatively easy to express multiple gRNAs to knock out several genes simultaneously , and thus this method is particularly useful for studying redundant genes , as exemplified by the analyses of Nsf and Snap genes . In comparison , almost all existing RNAi transgenes target single genes , and it is either labor intensive or impossible to combine them because they are inserted in few common loci . In this study , we developed a Cas9 collection for applying CRISPR-TRiM in motor neurons , somatic muscles , and glia cells , the three principal cell types that make up the NMJ . Even though the Gbb receptor Tkv accumulates at the boutons of both shrb and TSG101 KOs , it may exist in different states so that less Tkv protein in shrb KO is signaling capable . For genes that are expected to express late in the cell lineage , such as only in differentiating neurons , post-mitotic Cas9 can be early enough for causing LOF . If in-frame mutations at the target site do not completely disrupt a protein 's function , a portion of the cells carrying even biallelic mutations will

[ABSTRACT] Using expression analyses , genetic manipulation and pharmacological approaches , we found that the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish ( Rel ) shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that inducts them into the differentiation program by curtailing the activation of JNK . Our study sheds light on how , during development , integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways seem crucial to regulating cell fate transition during development . Studies have shown that ROS triggers the activation of JNK ( c-Jun Kinase ) , which upregulates fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) to facilitate progenitor differentiation . During larval stages , the lymph gland progenitors gradually accumulate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which is essential to prime them for differentiation . Post-larval hematopoiesis in Drosophila largely depends upon the stockpile of progenitors present in the blood-forming organ/lymph gland of the larvae . Although ROS serves as the metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation , the input from ROS is monitored by the developmental signal TAK1 , which is regulated by Relish . Intriguingly , despite having ROS , the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in the late larval stages . This developmental circuit ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In this light , our study foregrounds an essential cog in this wheel by showing how a member of the immune pathway can impinge upon metabolism to regulate progenitor cell fate and homeostasis of tissue during development . Along with our genetic evidence that illustrates that a decline in H3K9 acetylation upon Rel overexpression is an outcome of compromised FAO , we can not rule out the possible of involvement of HDACs in this process . However , in our case in sync with previous report , we rule out the involvement of microbe-derived acetate in regulating Rel expression in the lymph gland as no alteration in Rel expression was detected in the lymph glands of axenic larvae . The NF-κB/Relish is a crucial transcription factor in the Drosophila immune deficiency ( Imd ) pathway , activating antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) transcription to combat gram-negative bacterial infections , effectively generating an inflammatory response . Employing genetic , molecular and pharmacological studies demonstrate how a metabolic input is calibrated by a developmental signal downstream to Relish to prevent the differentiation program from becoming prodigal ( Fig 7F ) . Although the presence of relish can be detected in the embryonic lymph gland ( Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project , ) it is intriguing how its expression is restricted to the larval progenitor pool . In this context , it is important to note that microbe-derived acetate has been shown to activate the Drosophila Immunodeficiency ( IMD ) pathway in a subset of intestinal enteroendocrine cells . Our study reveals that Drosophila NF-κB factor Relish expresses strongly in the ROS-enriched progenitors and wanes as the cells move towards differentiation during development ( Fig 7E'-7E '' ) . On the other hand , sustained expression of the N- terminal Relish ( UAS-Rel 68 KD ) that is known to translocate into the nucleus resulted in a halt in the differentiation program . Our genetic data show that during development , Rel inhibits TAK1 to dampen JNK activation , thereby preventing precocious differentiation of the ROS-enriched myeloid-like progenitors . Interestingly , in hypertrophied animals where there was a decline in the level of Fatty Acid Oxidation in cardiomyocytes , administering NF-κB inhibitors showed significant improvement in disease progression . This intricate interaction between cell signalling pathway components and cellular metabolism in determining cell fate is vital for understanding normal development and has implications for disease progression . In order to restrain fasting-induced lipolysis and conserve cellular TAG levels , Rel-mediated repression of histone acetylation marks like H3K9 has been reported . NF-κB regulates vertebrate hematopoiesis through the transcription of genes involved in HSC fate and is known to play a crucial role in HSC emergence from the homogenic endothelium . Even though ROS is present in the entire progenitor pool at the late third instar stage ( Fig 7E-7E ' ) , differentiation initiates in the outer rim of the medullary zone . Previous biochemical analysis in S2 cells and genetic studies in the Drosophila hematopoietic niche has pinpointed that Rel inhibits TAK1 to control JNK activation . Lymph gland has been exploited to understand the several facets of NF-κB regulation on hematopoietic niches functionality during infection and development . Apart from cellular signalling pathways and growth factors , cellular metabolism has been majorly implicated in stem and progenitor cell fate determination in recent years . We further show that genetic loss of Relish from the progenitors lead to the activation of the JNK-FAO cascade , coaxing them to differentiate . Downregulation of FAO and subsequent reduction in H3K9 acetylation can be evidenced upon overexpression of Rel in the progenitors compared to the control . The observation that Relish is responsible for preventing JNK activation demands a node at which the JNK signaling is sensitive to the negative regulation of Relish . Interestingly Rel has been shown to evoke mir-317 to fine-tune PGRP-LC expression as well as AMPs in adult
[METHODS] ",,956,96,None,"The lymph gland is a major organ of the human body , containing the blood-forming organ/lymph gland of the larvae . During larval stages , the lymph gland progenitors gradually accumulate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which is essential to prime them for differentiation . However , ROS triggers the activation of JNK ( c-Jun Kinase ) to upregulate fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) in the progenitor pool . In this study , we show that the Drosophila NF-B transcription factor Relish ( Rel ) shields the progenic pool from the metabolic pathway that inducts them into the differentiation program by curtailing the activating of JK .

[ABSTRACT] After deciphering the impact of the variant on the RTTN protein function at centrosome in engineered RTTN-depleted RPE1 cells and patient fibroblasts , we analysed neural stem cells ( NSC ) derived from CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells and revealed major cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities , leading to aneuploidy , cell cycle arrest and cell death . Here , we report a patient presenting with TALS features but no pathogenic variants were found in RNU4ATAC , instead the homozygous RTTN c. 2953A > G variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing . Altogether , these defects contributed to a marked delay of rosette formation in RTTN-mutated organoids , thus impeding their overall growth and shedding light on mechanisms leading to microcephaly . In cortical organoids , we discovered an additional function of RTTN in the self-organisation of NSC into neural rosettes , by observing delayed apico-basal polarization of NSC . Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly with abnormal gyral pattern , severe growth retardation and bone abnormalities . Its transcript , the small nuclear RNA U4atac , is involved in the excision of ~850 minor introns . It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNU4ATAC gene .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Indeed , several studies reported that alterations of cilium disassembly lead to a reduction of the proliferation rate of NSC [ 38-42 ] , while another pointed out the role of cilium-related Shh pathway in NSC division into other progenitor cell types ( basal radial glial cells , intermediate progenitors ) necessary for brain size increase and folding . We showed that this variant mostly exerts its pathogenicity by inducing the skipping of in-frame exon 23 that encodes 23 amino-acids , and that it has a pleiotropic impact on diverse cellular processes occurring concomitantly or in cascade , including alterations of cell organization/polarity , division and survival of neural progenitors . These alterations of NSC were also seen in cortical organoids ( delayed proliferation/cell division , increased apoptosis ) ( Fig 7 ) , and are thus likely to contribute to the reduction of the NSC pool , which is responsible for the overall reduced number and size of neural rosettes ( Fig 6A-6C ) and hence , of organoids ( Fig 5 ) , mimicking the microcephaly seen in the patient . Not only does it reinforce the possible feature overlap between RNU4ATAC and RTTN mutated patients , but it also stresses the involvement of primary cilium defects in the pathophysiology of primary microcephaly syndromes-even though this clinical feature is not among those of the well-known ciliopathies . In addition to bringing information about the moderate damaging effect of the p. Arg985Gly variant per se , our study highlights here the crucial role of the 23 amino-acids ( Ser963 to Arg985 ) that yet , do not encompass a known functional domain . Whereas in previous reports it was suspected that patient symptoms resulted from the combined effects of the expression , at the protein level , of both the missense p. Arg985Gly and the p. Ser963_Arg985del ( Δ23 ) Rotatin forms , here we show that the missense p. Arg985Gly has low pathogenicity by itself . Indeed , we observed a reduced number of apical foci ( positive for ZO-1 , N-cadherin , and primary cilium ) ( Fig 6D-6F ) in RTTN-mutated organoids , suggesting a defect in apico-basal polarity establishment of the bipolar NSC . Indeed , it rescues most of the tested RTTN-dKO-related phenotypes in RPE1 cells , and this as efficiently as the WT form ( Figs 2 and S3 ) , except for primary cilium formation ( S4 Fig ) and mitosis ( Fig 2K ) . It is interesting to note that the levels of expression of the three isoforms do not vary much in the various cellular models used in this study ( skin fibroblasts , iPSC , NSC and cortical organoids ) . It has been reported in the gnomAD database at the heterozygous state in 4 individuals only ( out of 725 , 468 sequenced ) , all of them not unambiguously clustering with the major populations in a principal component analysis . In this article , we investigated the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of the RTTN c. 2953A > G variant identified in a patient with a Taybi-Linder-like syndrome , in fibroblasts derived from the patient , and for the first time , in human iPSC-derived neuronal models . The RTTN c. 2953A > G variant is present in a total of 5 out of 40 reported cases ( in 4 out of 24 families ) , who all originate from North Africa , thus suggesting a founder effect ( Fig 1D , and S1 Table ) . Hence , we hypothesize that the deletion of the 23 amino-acids may alter its conformation and/or the interaction with Rotatin partners-other than STIL-that help it to be brought to the centrosome . We could argue here that fibroblasts are differentiated cells that do not highly proliferate ; nevertheless , our results contradict previous published work , which highlights the issue of individual/clonal variability . This underscores

[ABSTRACT] The high parallelism with which adaptations occur under LTSP , combined with the LTSP populations ' lineage structure , enable us to screen for pairs of loci displaying a significant association in the occurrence of mutations , suggestive of a historical contingency . Like many other non-sporulating bacterial species , Escherichia coli is able to survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion , by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase ( LTSP ) . Utilizing whole genome sequencing data obtained for hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points spanning the first six years of these experiments , we reveal several novel aspects of the dynamics of adaptation . In these experiments populations of E. coli were allowed to initially grow on fresh rich media , but were not provided with any new external growth resources since their establishment . First , we show that E. coli continuously adapts genetically , up to six years under resource exhaustion , through the highly convergent accumulation of mutations . We find that such associations are highly frequent and that a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one such association . In July 2015 , we initiated a set of evolutionary experiments aimed at characterizing the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LTSP . Combined our results demonstrate that LTSP adaptation is characterized by remarkably high parallelism and frequent historical contingency . This lineage structure is in itself convergent , with similar lineages arising across independently evolving populations . We further show that upon entry into LTSP , long-lasting lineages are established .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Also , irrespective of the metric used , a similarly high percentage of convergently mutated loci ( more than one third ) were found to be involved in at least one putative contingency relationship , thus demonstrating that our major finding , that contingencies are highly frequent is fairly stable and reliable . For example if adaptations A , B , and C always occur first and only then do adaptations D , E and F occur , it would not explain why we would only see adaptation D on the background of A , and never on the background of B or C. That being said , further mechanistic studies will be needed in order to verify and determine the roles of the putative contingencies we identified . At the same time , we believe that the strong statistical associations we observe between the occurrence of mutations in lineages can not be entirely explained by such temporal ordering , without contingency , as such temporal ordering would not be expected to lead to certain adaptations only occurring on the background of other specific adaptations . Since the other experiments either did not span a long enough period of time , did not examine multiple populations ( over long periods of time ) , or did not carry out whole genome sequencing of individual clones , we could not use these data to search for putative contingencies and compare our results in this regard . Combined , the convergence with which adaptive mutations occur and the lineage structure of our populations enables us to identify hundreds of instances of putative historical contingencies and reveal that such contingencies are very common , affecting more than a third of convergently mutated loci . At the same time , by sequencing ~10 clones per population and time point sampled , we were able to observe that even though individual clones may adapt via highly divergent trajectories , at the population level one can observe very high levels of parallel adaptation . Fitting with this we indeed observe that while still highly convergent , non-mutator mutations that accumulate at later time points in our experiment appear to be less convergent than those occurring early on ( Fig 2D ) . The identified lineage structure of our LTSP populations and the high convergence with which mutations are acquired across independently evolving lineages allowed us to identify hundreds of loci pairs for which the acquisition of mutations is statistically significantly associated . This means that it is possible that even in the absence of a historical contingency ( by which the occurrence of a specific adaptation depends on the occurrence of another specific adaptation within the same clone ) , certain convergent adaptations may tend to occur previously to others . Thus , if researchers sequence only one or two clones per population and time point sampled , as is often done following evolutionary experiments , they will likely observe large variation between populations . Thus , it can be said that when it comes to the clones carrying a cytR + deoR mutation combination , the cells that replicated and rose to high frequencies at a given time point , were not descendants of those that replicated and rose to high frequencies during a previous time point . Searching for putative historical contingencies , using our methodology requires whole genome sequencing data from a large number of individual clones sampled at several time points , from multiple independently evolving populations and lineages . At the same time this reduction is not very substantial and dN/dS remains significantly higher than 1 throughout the experiment ( Fig 2C and S3 Table ) , indicating continuous adaptation under positive selection .

[ABSTRACT] Although originally classified as a non-coding RNA , the male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) RNA from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex has recently been shown to code for a micropeptide that plays a vital role in determining how mated females use stored sperm after mating . Through cell culture and transgenic analysis , we show that this mechanism relies on the presence of upstream open reading frames present in these two exons that prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames . Interestingly , the MSA transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript produced in both sexes within the posterior central nervous system from an alternative promoter , called the iab-8 lncRNA . Here , we show that the absence of iab-8 translation is due to a repressive mechanism requiring the two unique 5 ' exons of the iab-8 lncRNA . However , while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide , it seems that the iab-8 transcript does not .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Under stress conditions , these factors are less available and causing the 40S subunit to bypass the additional inhibitory uORFs to eventually find the GCN4 coding sequence , by which time it has formed the ternary complex to initiate translation . However , this is not unexpected and likely reflects the poor resolution of our lens when examining phenotype ; subtle behavioral phenotypes or slight changes in neural connectivity , for example , would go largely unnoticed by our analysis . The recent popularity of techniques like ribosome profiling has highlighted an additional level of complexity to this aspect of gene regulation by finding that translation initiation can also be impacted through competition among the sites of translation initiation . This is consistent with both our previously described finding of transcriptional interference on the abd-A promoter by the iab-8 transcript , and the concept of posterior dominance within the hox complexes ( where posterior/upstream genes function over anterior/downstream genes ) . While we believe that the uORFs in the iab-8 transcript might be used to prevent the creation of spurious ABD-A protein , this does preclude the coded peptides from having a biological function in their own right . Although we have not tested if ribosomes stall on the iab-8 transcript , we decided to examine the codon usage of the uORFs with the idea that a preponderance of rare codons might also slow ribosome progression . While the interactions between overlapping ORFs are believed to occur via physical interference of translating ribosomes and with downstream translation initiation , the control of translation initiation from non-overlapping , downstream ORFs seems to be mechanistically more complicated . While we were drawn into this work by the effect of translation inhibition by uORFs that seem to be non-overlapping , we found that the numerous `` regulatory '' uORFs , regulate themselves via overlapping , out-of-frame translation . The position of its promoter within the iab-8 region of the Drosophila bithorax complex allows it to be expressed in the posterior of the embryo where it can restrict posterior expression of more-anterior hox genes . In the case of iab-8 , we have previously shown that the mechanism of transcriptional interference actually requires that the iab-8 transcript extends into the abd-A transcription unit and that these transcripts splice into abd-A exons . Although this may be true at an evolutionary scale , we have not been able to discover an overt phenotype associated with ectopic expression of the MSA transcript . Ribosome profiling studies have shown that there are over 35 , 000 translated but largely unannotated uORFs present in the ~13500 annotated genes of Drosophila melanogaster . But this type of regulation can lead to a potential problem when a ncRNA is made to be the agent of transcriptional interference , as alternative splicing can actually lead to unwanted protein synthesis . Since the early studies of Shine-Delgarno and Kozak [ 24-26 ] , it has long been known that not all start codons promote translation initiation equally . Furthermore , we can not rule out that these peptides may play prominent roles in other closely related Drosophila species that have been mostly lost in melanogaster . A similar type of regulation seems to happen with the CPA1 transcript in yeast that is stalled by high levels of arginine , sensed by the uORF nascent peptide . And although this has been one of the most studied areas of molecular biology , it represents only one mechanism by which cells can control protein levels . With the growing number of uORFs being discovered , a more comprehensive method to quickly analyze phenotypes may be required to unlock the vast number of potential biological functions of uORFs . Given that the related MSA transcript makes a biologically important peptide from it shared 3 ' exon , it seems likely that the translational repression of this peptide may be the biologically important role of these uORFs . Because transcripts with uORFs are markedly less expressed than genes without uORFs , it seems that

[ABSTRACT] ERC analysis of disease genes and biological pathways allows for rapid prioritization of potential genetic modifiers , which can provide a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets . CDG typically present with seizures , hypotonia , and developmental delay but display large clinical variability with symptoms affecting every system in the body . We also identified strong patterns of ERC based on cellular sub-localization of the GPI anchor synthesis enzymes . Using ERC , we identified strong evolutionary rate signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways . Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with ncRNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins . Because of the similar physiology and clinical symptoms , there are likely common genetic modifiers between CDG . Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes . Evolutionary rate covariation ( ERC ) identifies proteins with similar evolutionary rates that indicate shared biological functions and pathways . Here , we use evolution as a tool to identify common modifiers between CDG and glycosylation genes . Mutations in glycosylation pathways , such as N-linked glycosylation , O-linked glycosylation , and GPI anchor synthesis , lead to Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ( CDG ) . Protein glycosylation is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals . This variability suggests modifier genes might influence the phenotypes .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] It is feasible that cytoplasmic components interact with a wider variety of proteins , which also influence their evolutionary rates in different ways , making it more difficult for them to have strong ERC scores . Since glycosylation is a co-translational/post-translational modification , it suggests the evolutionary relationship identified between glycosylation proteins and rRNA processing proteins could be due to glycosylation 's dependence on the ribosome functioning properly and translating proteins . High ERC between N-linked glycosylation and GPI anchor synthesis could also suggest unexplored connections between these pathways , and they may need to be studied together instead of in isolation . In vivo testing of top hits from our analysis had a hit rate ( 10 out of 16 ) higher than previously found in other ERC studies ( 5/16 and 12/34 , respectively ) . N-glycans and GPI anchors have multiple mannoses added to their glycan chains , and they both rely on the DPM complex to supply mannose into the lumen of the ER . Previous attempts to identify genetic modifiers with standard methods ( i. e. , mutagenesis screens and using natural variation in the population ) have found promising candidates [ 14-16 , 20 ] . Only one type of O-linked glycan incorporates mannose , which could explain why O-linked glycosylation does not have as high of ERC scores with the other glycosylation pathways . Until now , ERC has been used primarily to characterize unknown proteins or identify new proteins involved in specific pathways [ 19 , 40-42 , 50-54 ] . When analyzing ERC scores of GPI anchor synthesis proteins across the genome , we found that GPI anchor synthesis proteins acting on the cytoplasmic side of the ER had fewer high ERC scores than proteins acting on the luminal side of the ER . Further exploration of these common modifiers could lead to novel therapeutic targets for CDG patients that may be broadly applied to multiple types of CDG . Because modifier genes genetically interact with their disease genes , it is logical that they would also be evolutionarily related to each other . This requirement for both N-linked glycosylation and GPI anchor synthesis for protein folding might explain why the two different glycosylation pathways are evolutionarily linked . Using ERC to identify disease modifiers is a novel application that could be applied to help better understand and treat rare diseases . In this study , we used evolutionary methods to explore genetic modifiers of CDG and prioritize candidate genes for in vivo testing . CDG are poorly understood , multi-systemic disorders with extensive phenotypic variability , suggesting a role for genetic background and modifier genes . The different CDG are likely connected because they all affect protein glycosylation and show similar symptoms in patients . In the ER , N-glycans on GPI-anchored proteins allow them to interact with chaperone proteins for proper protein folding . On average , glycosylation protein pairs showed high ERC regardless of whether the two proteins were in the same pathway . GO analysis of proteins showing high ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins resulted in multiple terms related to ncRNA . Further studies need to be performed to identify the specific protein interactions driving the association between these two pathways . CDG patients have a broad clinical spectrum influenced by different disease-causing variants , environmental factors , and genetic background . Glycosylation is highly conserved from yeast to mammals allowing for strong evolutionary signals to have developed over time . However , we found exceptionally high ERC scores between proteins involved in GPI anchor synthesis and N-linked glycosylation . This was unexpected because all the proteins in the GPI anchor synthesis pathway are only known to act in that pathway . Another potential explanation could be the necessity of N-linked glycosylation for proper folding of

[ABSTRACT] These findings not only decipher the mechanism by which Pol-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc regulates pgRNA encapsulation , but also reveal the possibility of PP1 as a potential target for antiviral development . Therefore , HBV Pol may play a dual role by initially bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HBc and recruiting PP1 for later completion of RNA packaging into the capsids . Pol-pgRNA-PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and appears to be associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) . The Pol-dependent dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 was confirmed by the substitution of one single amino acid at Val782 in the RNase H domain , which abolished the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 . As capsids mature , the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation , suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation , which remains to be determined . Phosphorylation of the HBc CTD , especially at Ser162 and Ser170 , is essential for nucleation with the polymerase ( Pol ) to initiate pgRNA encapsidation . This recruitment does not require HBc but does require Pol via epsilon RNA signal , suggesting that the Pol-pgRNA complex plays a key role in PP1 recruitment . Immunoprecipitation , mass spectrometry analyses , and the protein structural analyses showed that the recruitment of the host phosphatase PP1 is dependent on the Pol-Val782 domain . The HBV core ( HBc ) protein contains an N-terminal domain ( NTD ) for capsid assembly and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain ( CTD ) for pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) encapsidation . Using a C-S170 antibody specific for non-phosphorylated HBc-Ser170 , we observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state during pgRNA packaging .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Although our study has clarified the role of Pol-dependent HBc dephosphorylation in the formation of mature HBV nucleocapsids , it is worth noting that previous studies using HBc non-phosphorylatable ( Ser to Ala ) mutants have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser residues at 162 and 170 of HBc is required for the packaging of pgRNA . At the same time , phosphorylated HBc-Ser170 ( and/or HBc-Ser162 ) also plays a key role in the recruitment of Pol-pgRNA complex , which acts to nucleate capsid assembly and is critical for accumulating the first few subunits of the growing capsid as well as the formation of an incomplete RNA-filled capsids . The use of the Pol-V782Y mutant ( in either the WT or YMHD mutant replicon ) , which retains two major functions of Pol for encapsidation ( formation of Pol-pgRNA complexes and interaction with HBc ) but impairs PP1 recruitment , confirmed the crucial role of Pol in mediating the dephosphorylation process to complete RNA encapsidation . Since our C-S170 Ab is specific only for the non-phosphorylated Ser170-containing epitope , further studies may be needed to investigate the effect of Pol-recruited PP1 on other putative phosphorylation sites in HBc CTD . Our study , using Pol-V782Y in HBV , identified for the first time its critical role in recruiting PP1 phosphatase to dephosphorylate HBc-Ser170 , which is also worth testing in DHBV or other hepadnaviruses . However , this disparity could be reconciled by considering the importance of HBc phosphorylation in the early stage of HBc assembly , with dephosphorylation becoming crucial in the later stages , as discussed in more detail below . Therefore , Pol could have dual functions in the RNA encapsidation process : the binding of pgRNA to the HBc dimer/multimer intermediate ( nucleation ) and the recruitment of PP1 to dephosphorylate HBc for complete compaction of the nucleocapsid ( enclosure ) . The underlying mechanism may be that phosphorylation of HBc in dimeric and multimeric intermediates helps open the locked CTD of HBc by preventing disulfide bond formation between Cys48 and Cys183 in the dimers . Importantly , our study focused primarily on the later stages of pgRNA encapsidation , and future research should explore the potential specific functions of HBc phosphorylation in the early stages of encapsidation and their relationship with phase separation . Consistent with this , Prof. Guo 's study also showed that RNA encapsulation in HBV replicon transfected cells was reduced when PP1 activity was inhibited , by using PP1 inhibitors or by knocking down PP1 expression . In line with this , we demonstrated that Pol recruits the phosphatase PP1 to dephosphorylate HBc-Ser170 , which is dependent on pgRNA through the epsilon RNA signal , even in the absence of HBc . Our findings , demonstrating Pol-mediated PP1 recruitment and HBc dephosphorylation in the cytoplasm , potentially within late endosomes/MVBs , may represent the later cytoplasmic phase of pgRNA packaging and nucleocapsid maturation . Once this complex binds to the incomplete capsids composed of phosphorylated HBc , PP1 dephosphorylates HBc , which is essential for the subsequent packaging of the Pol-pgRNA-PP1 complex to form compacted capsids to complete the RNA packaging step . However , our data showed that only a minimal amount of pgRNA is packaged , resulting in capsids containing a very small amount of DNA , which complicates further analysis of DNA synthesis in this context . The interior space adopts a more complex conformation with relatively strong density in phospho-mimic capsids , while it exhibits an icosahedral conformation and weak density , representing native HBV virions , in dephosphorylated capsids . Thus , our study provides an explanation for the previous observation that the substitution

[ABSTRACT] We sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena ( family Lucinidae ) collected on either side of the Isthmus , to investigate how differing environmental conditions have influenced the selection of symbionts and their metabolic capabilities . The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct environmental conditions in the Tropical Eastern Pacific ( TEP ) and Caribbean , offering a `` natural experiment '' for studying how closely related animals evolve and adapt under environmental change . It highlights the importance of nitrogen availability in driving the ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbiont species and the role that bacterial symbionts may play in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions . Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon by including other lucinid symbiont genomes from around the world further revealed that the last common ancestor ( LCA ) of Ca . Bacterial symbionts , with their shorter generation times and capacity for horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) , play a critical role in allowing marine organisms to cope with environmental change . The lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts and only those from the Caribbean had the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation , while those from the TEP did not . Interestingly , this nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny , suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions . Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes , and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through HGT from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage . Our study suggests that HGT of the nif operon has facilitated niche diversification of the globally distributed Ca . However , the role of bacterial symbionts in this process is often overlooked .

[DISCUSSION] Sedimenticola endophacoides clade associated with P. pectinatus from a region in Florida that experiences seasonal upwelling events [ 52-54 ] presents the opportunity to study how a change in access to abundant nutrient resources could drive gene loss and eventually lead to diversification of this clade . Hence , the absence of nitrogen fixation genes in the symbiont MAGs from the nitrogen-rich TEP region is consistent with the hypothesis that lucinid symbiont diazotrophy has evolved as an adaptation to life in nitrogen-poor oligotrophic habitats like tropical coral reefs and seagrass beds . Given that both MAGs were obtained from samples of the same host species and location ( Queensland , Australia ) ( Fig 3B ) , and no additional metadata is available , further investigation is required to understand evolution of nitrogen fixation in the Monitilora ramsayi symbiosis . It is intriguing to speculate that the gammapolyglutamate synthesis and ETF dehydrogenase genes are beneficial to the TEP symbionts during the seasonal environmental changes typical of upwelling regions , which include changes in nutrient levels , colder temperatures , or reduced oxygen levels [ 38-41 ] . quadrata lineages , which either originate from nutrient-rich upwelling regions or deep waters ( S2 Table ) , are incapable of fixing nitrogen , possibly due to the absence of selection pressure that would drive the acquisition and maintenance of this function . These findings indicate that both these clades have convergently acquired nitrogen fixation capabilities in an oligotrophic environment , and further suggests the horizontal transfer of nitrogen fixation genes might be a major factor enabling lucinid symbiont adaptation to nitrogen-poor conditions . The capacity to acquire novel metabolic capabilities in response to different nutrient conditions could have important implications for how animal-bacteria symbioses might respond to anthropogenic changes in the environment , such as nutrient loading due to changes in land use . The remarkable flexibility in the partnerships between lucinid clams and diverse symbiont candidates , all sharing the same core metabolic capabilities but different accessory genes , could enhance the resilience of these associations to changing environmental conditions . Electron-transferring-flavoprotein ( ETF ) dehydrogenase genes were also enriched in the MAGs from the TEP symbionts ( Table 1 ) ; this enzyme is upregulated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas syringae in response to low temperatures and in Neisseria gonorrhoeae under anaerobic conditions . However , the abundance of free-living `` PEGO '' symbionts and their close relatives has not been measured , and further investigation of the free-living microbial communities in lucinid habitats is required to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these dynamics . T. endolucinida lineages cross the 95 % ANI threshold , widely used to delimit bacterial species , which suggests that these clades , in spite of their essential differences in nitrogen metabolism , represent a single species [ 24-26 ] . Our investigation focused on understanding how environmental conditions on either side of the Isthmus of Panama have influenced the distribution , diversity and metabolic functions of symbionts associated with lucinid sister species separated by the closure of the Isthmus . The coastal waters of the TEP are frequently enriched with nutrients due to seasonal upwelling , leading to nitrate levels that are roughly ten times higher than those found in seagrass beds in the Caribbean . T. gloverae symbiont species , together with their global distribution ranges , present an interesting opportunity to study the origins of genetically cohesive units with species-like properties and characterize the ecological factors underlying bacterial bacterial diversification . Our findings align with these observations , suggesting that during the microbial speciation process , ecological divergence is

Bacterial symbionts , with their shorter generation times and capacity for horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) , play a critical role in allowing marine organisms to cope with environmental change and their metabolic capabilities . However , the role of bacteriophages in this process is often overlooked . We sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymicrobial bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena ( family Lucinidae ) collected on either side of the island of Panama , to investigate how divergent environmental conditions have influenced the selection of bacterial species and their metabolism capacities . Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon by including other lucinid sYmbiont genomes from around the world further revealed that the last common ancestor ( LCA ) of Ca . Thiodiazotropha lacked nIF genes , and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nigra nf HDKT . This nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to szymbiont phylogeny , suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions ."

[ABSTRACT] Mammalian TAS2Rs have historically garnered the most attention , leading to our understanding of their roles in taste perception relevant to human physiology and behaviors . Large-scale phylogenomic analyses reveal that frogs and salamanders contain unusually high TAS2R gene content , in stark contrast to other vertebrate lineages . We find that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species , although total TAS2R count is stable in most lineages . In vitro receptor activity assays uncover that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics . In most species , TAS2R genes are found in clusters ; compared to other vertebrates , amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster . However , the evolution and functional implications of TAS2Rs in other vertebrate lineages remain less explored . Interestingly , TAS2R count is proportional to the receptors expressed solely in extra-oral tissues . TAS2Rs are a family of G protein-coupled receptors that function as bitter taste receptors in vertebrates . Here , we identify 9 , 291 TAS2Rs from 661 vertebrate genomes .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Overall , our detailed gene cluster analysis across vertebrates suggests that the frequent formation and expansion of TAS2R clusters due to their local genomic environments may be a major driver of the large and lineage-specific TAS2Rs repertoires in amphibians . Our unified gene mining workflow across over 600 vertebrates indicates that in frogs and salamanders ( batrachians ) the TAS2Rs gene family experienced a rapid expansion , leading to a wider repertoire of these genes than any other lineage of vertebrates examined to date . The high levels of gene turnover in some TAS2R lineages suggest that there may be some degree of interchangeability between genes , perhaps because they fulfill similar functions , and are therefore able to compensate for the loss of other genes . We also find that these cluster loci can be very old ( up to 350 million years ) , even though the genes within them appear comparatively young , either due to rapid gene turnover or gene conversion . The mutational input ( i. e. , gene duplication , loss , and conversion ) promoted by recombination may have provided the raw material for novel expression patterns to arise , and perhaps allowed for rapid expansion and diversification of TAS2Rs within the batrachian lineage . For instance , bullfrogs have intestinal/liver receptors for marinobufagenin , which is produced by cane toads and their relatives , and is similar to other cardiotonic steroids ( i. e. , cardenolides ) present in a wide variety of toxic plants and animals . We propose that several TAS2Rs may fulfill tissue-specific functions in extra-oral tissues , with a different list of receptors in the tongue guiding feeding behavior ; in the intestines and liver guiding metabolism ; and in the brain controlling levels of stimulation . It is possible that a shift in the selective landscape of these genes in batrachians may have released these pressures , allowing for the copy number increase of previously constrained TAS2R loci , contributing to the expansion of the batrachian TAS2R repertoire . Likewise , a cane toad that has received confirmation of the presence of toxins in its skin or glands via its TAS2Rs might take more risks , while inhibition of these receptors might induce toxin production or hiding behaviors . Based on our expression and assay data , we propose that extra-oral TAS2R activity may be important for amphibian responses to toxins in their diet , their own chemical arsenal , and perhaps their environment . Considering the prominent and important extra-oral functions of TAS2Rs , we suggest that amphibian TAS2Rs be considered as `` specialized chemosensory receptors , `` to emphasize their broad range of proposed functions beyond conscious oral taste . We also find that two large bodied frogs have receptors recognizing some frog toxins in the oral cavity and/or extra-oral tissues , which could be involved in the detection of dietary toxins . Comparative phylogenetic analyses suggest that this expansion may have been allowed by a higher gene duplication , perhaps influenced by higher recombination rates in TAS2R clusters , as well as a much higher retention rate ( i. e. , lower loss rate ) than in other lineages . The oral receptors possibly contribute to the decision whether frogs ingest bufadienolide ( or cardenolide ) -laden prey such as toads ( including their eggs and larva [ 80-82 ] ) , or cardiotoxic insects . Upon careful review of our intermediate results , we did find the same genes among our BLAST hits , but with scores that disqualified them at the early stages of filtering . While our study has focused on toxic xenobiotics , it might be fruitful to search for endogenously produced TAS2R ligands such as steroid hormones and bile acids . This may be caused by the differences in the gene identification pipeline including the initial BLAST search parameters ( e. g. , threshold of evalue cutoff and query sequences ) and the transmembrane prediction software .

[ABSTRACT] To ask if HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes , we used the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could prevent the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitors ( DBZ or DAPT ) treatment in mice and spheroids , suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells . Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids uncovered no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene miss-regulation , confirmed impaired stem cell maintenance in-vitro , and discovered an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts , a likely underlying cause for heightened sensitivity in NDD mice . TurboID followed by quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line expressing either NOTCH2DD or NOTCH2 revealed an unbalanced interactome , with reduced interaction of NOTCH2DD with the transcription machinery but relatively preserved interaction with the HDAC2 interactome suggesting modulation via cooperativity . Mice expressing Notch dimerization-deficient alleles ( NDD ) of Notch1 and Notch2 are sensitized to environmental insults but otherwise develop and age normally . A tri-protein complex containing NICD , RBPj and MAML1 binds DNA as monomer or as cooperative dimers to regulate transcription .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Because biotinylation of the HDAC2-anchored complex is affected to a lesser degree in Notch2RA-TurboID relative to the reduction in the positive regulator network interactions , we hypothesized that perhaps the HDAC2 biotinylation may occur when a monomer NTC is sharing SPS with a co repressor complex , or that HDAC2 might play a role outside of transcription , and possibly outside the canonical function of NICD . Moreover , spheroids form NDD mice show enrichment for genes associated with host defense against symbionts and interferon-ß targets , consistent with an elevated colonic epithelium innate immunity response in the absence of immune cells or symbionts ; none of these transcripts is known to be a direct Notch target . Conditional deletion of HDAC2 alone was shown to protect against DSS , however , and in contrast to the benefits of HDAC inhibition , deletion of both HDAC1 and 2 in mice seems to enhance sensitivity to induced colitis and disrupts epithelial barrier function [ 62-64 ] , indicating that at least some activity is necessary to rip the protective benefits . Since the transcriptomic analysis did not explain why loss of dimerization affected performance in some areas but not others , we investigated the hypothesis the Notch dimers had different proteomic envelop than NICD or monomers , and that the differences might be contributing to the phenotype . However , the most important RBPj co-repressor partner , MINT/SHARP/SPEN [ 52-55 ] was recovered at similar levels by Streptavidin alone from all cells including parental HT-29 ( S2 Table ) , reflecting low level of basal biotinylation . To conclude , Notch dimerization in mammals seem to be less about transcriptional regulation of an enhancer subset to which they bind through SPS , and more about the overall proteome environment with indirect consequences to innate immunity and barrier functions underlying the hypersensitivity of NDD mice . If the putative antagonism reflects direct interaction and non-histone acetylation , it may explain several reports where the canonical model is inconsistent with the data , and suggest that a subset of acylated proteins are key to the regulation of secretory cell fates . We show that dimerization-deficiency mimics a subset of Notch loss of function ( LOF ) phenotypes in the small intestine , namely , reduction of stem cells and increase in Paneth cells ( Figs 2-4 ) but no goblet cell metaplasia ( S2 Fig , [ 22 , 23 , 25-27 ] ) . VPA is extensively used to as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer and is suggested , according to sources such as the Therapeutic Target Database , to act ( directly or indirectly ) via modulation of signaling pathways ; such activities may also contribute to its effects in this study . This heightened response to symbionts under basal , laboratory controlled sterile conditions can explain why NDD mice develop colitis when 1 % DSS slightly increased exposure to the gut microbiome , or by inference , when fur mites colonized the skin . It is possible that Notch2 and HDAC2 act independently and antagonistically such that co-inhibition has a milder phenotype then the loss of either pathway by reducing or eliminating the need for NICD binding at critical enhancers . Intriguingly , the data we present are also consistent with a model in which NICD dimers somehow regulate HDAC2 deacetylase activity , and loss of this negative regulation and reduction in protein acetylation are part of the Notch LOF phenotype . Unexpectedly , RNAseq data from colonic spheroids did not identify differential expression of dimer-dependent targets , recording instead overall reduction in Notch-supported function such as proliferation and barrier function ( Fig 5 and S1 Table ) . We report that HDAC inhibition can protect the mouse small intestine in vivo from the GSI inhibitor DBZ and restore proliferation and Paneth cells numbers in spheroid in ex vivo cultures supplemented with DAPT ( Fig 7 ) .

[ABSTRACT] The theory of background selection may be split into two regimes : the background selection regime , where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are sufficiently low such that deleterious alleles are at a deterministic mutation-selection balance , and the interference selection regime , where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are sufficiently high that deleterious alleles accumulate and interfere with another , leading to selective interference . Here , we derive novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extend previous theory from the interference selection regime to make predictions in an island model . Moreover , we demonstrate that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates , because migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations . Furthermore , there is evidence to suggest that migration reduces the effects of background selection on FST , but this has not been fully explained . Background selection , by which selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites , influences patterns of total neutral diversity , πT , and genetic differentiation , FST , in structured populations . However , we show that background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT , particularly for metapopulations with a larger effective population size . Our work further extends the theory of background selection into structured populations , and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans . Previous work has quantified the effects of background selection on πT and FST only for deleterious alleles in the background selection regime . Using simulations , we show that this theory best predicts FST and πT .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In summary , we have provided a novel theoretical derivation of the effects of background selection in an island model ; this model accounts for the effects of migration providing an opportunity to lessen the effects of background selection by truncating cross-generational associations between neutral and deleterious alleles in their reproductive success , and presents a first step into the application of background selection theory in systems with more complex demography . Here , we have extended quantitative genetic models of background selection [ 11 , 25-26 ] to account for the effects of migration in an island model , showing that migration , in addition to selection and recombination , acts to end the cross-generational association between a neutral allele and linked deleterious alleles . Our work suggests that the relative importance of the 'migration effect ' in influencing Blocal depends on the magnitude of the heterozygous selection coefficient , t , and the migration rate , m. In cases where t > > m , we expect the effect of migration to be relatively weak , as selection will likely act to remove deleterious variants prior to their emigration from a population . In cases where migration rates are comparable to or stronger than the strength of selection against deleterious alleles , that is , m ≥ t , we expect deleterious alleles to emigrate from local populations at an appreciable rate prior to their removal via selection . Under low recombination regions with substantial selective interference and recessivity of deleterious mutations , there is evidence that associative overdominance may act oppositely to background selection , instead leading to increased genetic diversity [ 52-53 ] . Our work provides a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed lack of effect of background selection on FST under high migration rates , and highlights parameter space under which we expect background selection theory to be inaccurate . We did not explore the effects of varying deleterious selection coefficients on B , but it is possible that the combination of both weakly and moderately deleterious alleles may result in more complex dynamics of background selection . We test the accuracy of the theory under various parameter sets , demonstrating that it predicts FST accurately across a wide range of parameters and predicts πT well when we expect selective interference to be weak . A useful property of these models is that predictions for B may be made under weak selection , by considering that weakly deleterious alleles have an appreciable rate of fixation via genetic drift . , where it is stated that the effects of background selection on FST are primarily through reductions in diversity , πS , within populations ; this conclusion was evidenced by simulations with Nlocalm = 1 . Under this regime of non-trivial migration rates , we expect the effects of background selection on FST to be significantly attenuated , as we expect greater similarity in reductions in πS and πT . Prior to this work , models of background selection have been restricted to the case of populations that are panmictic [ 1 , 3-4 , 23-26 ] or have low migration rates [ 2 , 35-36 ] . However , the effects of background selection on FST and πT remain unexplored for other population subdivision models , such as 'isolation-by-distance ' models with varying dimensionality . We tested the predictions of our novel derivation using simulations and found that it best predicts FST and πT under varying strengths of selection , recombination rates , and migration rates . Under this relatively low migration regime , we expect predictions of background selection to be accurate even without consideration of the migration effect , given

[ABSTRACT] Motivated by these , we developed FedGMMAT , a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites . As the sample sizes become more heterogeneous , complex statistical approaches , such as generalized linear mixed effects models , must be used to correct for the confounders that may bias results . On another front , due to the privacy concerns around Protected Health Information ( PHI ) , genetic information is restrictively protected by sharing according to regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) . Using simulated and real datasets , we demonstrate FedGMMAT can achieve the virtually same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements . Federated approaches are promising to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance , since sensitive data never leaves the local sites . Evidently , establishing practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies . Genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites , and the intermediate statistics are protected by encryption . This limits data sharing among institutions and hampers efforts around executing high-powered collaborative studies . Increasing genetic and phenotypic data size is critical for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We also believe that the two-stage significance estimation is advantageous from a privacy preserving perspective because the overall problem is modularized in specific steps of null model fitting and variant scoring where covariates and genotype information is used in different stages . However , it should be noted that FedGMMAT 's null model contains very small number of parameters ( on the order to 10-20 ) and we foresee that it is unlikely that the global model parameters can lead to reliable membership or reconstruction attacks . Due to these challenges , the sites may choose to perform meta-analyses by sharing only the summary statistics , which requires much less computational burden on the sites with low privacy concerns . Thus , our future work will focus on refining the current method by adding secure multi-computation protections , embedding a tree-based asynchronous communication framework , and using lightweight communication protocols . In the future , this can in turn enable a tiered privacy-enabling design for GWAS such that different information is protected at different levels as required by local regulations . FedGMMAT is flexible to integrate multiple subject-level random effects and can be used in different study designs without explicit changes to the algorithmic setup and formulations . For instance , these studies must be designed and planned way ahead of time to collect harmonized and uniform data at independent sites with matching covariates and phenotypes . This model should also be tuned well to ensure that null model is not overly relaxed or stringent , which may diminish the model 's power to detect associations . Of note , the central server performs lightweight operations and does not bear substantial computational load , which can be implemented as a trusted service . FedGMMAT currently relies on a round-robin ( or cyclic ) schedule , which requires sites to wait for their turns without asynchronous updates . FedGMMAT assumes an honest-but-curious adversarial model , which is the predominant assumption for the adversaries in genomic data analysis . However , previous studies have shown that meta-analysis may lose substantial power when there is heterogeneity among the sites . This can be achieved by setting up a central key management and aggregation service that is operated by a trusted entity ( e. g. NIH ) . In addition , the current implementation relies on TenSEAL framework which may not be optimal for the communication bandwidth . Future studies are necessary to ensure that the malicious entities can not disrupt the calculations or steal sensitive information . The models can be extended to accommodate random slopes models to account for the structured heterogeneity of the genetic effects coefficients . This is an inherent advantage that stems from the flexible formulation of the efficient score testing of GMMAT . It is therefore important for sites to have the incentives to perform the federated analysis . It should be noted that there can be inherent challenges in federated studies . Currently , the null model information is sent in unprotected form among the sites . Finally , the statistical model that GMMAT uses models the random effects as random intercepts . In this paper , we proposed a federated genetic association testing algorithm , FedGMMAT . This , however , would require substantial changes to the current algorithm . The central site must be a trusted and non-colluding entity . Future work can improve several aspects of FedGMMAT .

[ABSTRACT] In this study , we benchmark the predictive power of six widely used PRS derivation algorithms , including four of which adjust for ancestry , against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts . We find modest improvement in discriminatory ability when compared with a simple method that prioritizes variants , clumping , and published polygenic risk scores . While their accuracy continues to improve , research aimed at enhancing their effectiveness within African and Asian populations remains key for equitable use . Recent algorithmic developments for PRS derivation have resulted in improved pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases . Our findings underscore the importance of improving upon risk prediction algorithms and the sampling of diverse cohorts . Polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ) offer promising advancements in predicting disease risk , including prostate cancer . Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-biased incidence and mortality .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Additionally , it is possible that individuals annotated as AFR may represent distinct subpopulations , considering the vast genetic diversity within Africa , and the dissimilarity may be heightened between continents ( Europe vs North America ) . Given the dramatic diversity in incidence and outcome data across ancestry groups , poorly performing risk prediction tools may compromise risk stratification and patient care , particularly for those most likely to be afflicted . While there is no consensus on PRS evaluation metrics and several studies report pseudo-R2 , odds ratio or AUROC , we show that alternative metrics such as AUROC produce a different ranking of polygenic risk scores . We find that while PRScsx explains the greatest amount of variance in logistic classifier models , it does not outperform other methods in classification accuracy on held-out data . These algorithms are based on variant prioritization , continuous shrinkage , joint analysis of summary statistics , functional annotation , fine mapping and the utilization of population-specific heritability estimates . Additionally , it is possible that whole genome sequencing , rather than array-based genotyping , may capture additional ancestry-biased causal variants , yielding improved risk prediction . Lastly , we note that polygenic score and the age of an individual are sufficient for acceptable classification of prostate cancer cases and controls across ancestries . However , most individuals are admixed , and each admixture component has further fine-scale population structure that may prevent portability ( e. g. Saharan vs Sub-Saharan ancestry ) . Careful integration of several strategies such as thresholding genetic correlation between the source and target population and sample size thresholding may yield improved risk prediction . These results suggest that the genetic correlation , measured by the correlation of polygenic scores , within individual ancestries is greater than that between prostate cancer cases . First , we limit the analysis to genotyping arrays to maintain consistency and maximize sample size across the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts . In our comprehensive analysis across two biobank-scale datasets , we benchmarked six algorithms and find modest improvement over traditional clumping methods . To our knowledge , this is the first study to assess pan-ancestry polygenic risk for prostate cancer in the All of Us cohort . Recent reports suggest that multi-ancestry PRS generating strategies are trait-specific and that out-of-the-box methods may not generalize . For example , we grouped East Asian and South Asian individuals together to maximize the sample size of a population with low prostate cancer incidence . Taken together , our findings highlight the necessity for advanced computational strategies that more accurately reflect the genetic diversity across populations . Our work highlights the need for additional algorithms to predict risk across populations as well as the sampling of diverse cohorts . Third , although several ancestry-adjustment algorithms exist [ 25-28 ] , we limited our study to six commonly used ones . Recent advances in statistical genetics have led to improved methods for cross-ancestry PRS disease risk prediction . Our study employed ancestry-correction using linkage disequilibrium maps from one of the largest publicly available sources . It is possible that the sample sizes that derived these maps are inadequate , and that finer resolution mapping is required . However , these improved models have not been formally assessed for their predictive performance in prostate cancer . However , based on our results , it seems unlikely that additional tuning would significantly alter prediction accuracy . Furthermore , inclusion of local ancestry haplotype models may improve predictive power of scores , especially for admixed individuals . Second , although we identified genetic ancestry , we could not perfectly account for population structure , admixture and subpopulations . In our benchmark , we find that hierarchical clustering is adequate to stratify polygenic scores by ancestry . Discrepancies in processing pipelines between derivation and validation data may limit the generalizability of our findings . For example , transfer learning and XGBoost result in more accurate predictions across a variety of traits . Although we performed a robust benchmark and evaluated several

[ABSTRACT] Loss of both dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model , suggesting that dopaminergic flux and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DPAGT1 deficiency . We performed a drug repurposing screen on this model using 1 , 520 small molecules that are 98 % FDA/EMA-approved to find drugs that improved its eye . Notably from this screen , we found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DPAGT1-CDG model . These drugs and subsequent analyses reveal novel biology in DPAGT1 mechanisms , and they may represent new therapeutic options for DPAGT1-CDG . We also genetically validate other top drug categories including acetylcholine-related drugs , COX inhibitors , and an inhibitor of NKCC1 . This links dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation and represents a new potential therapeutic target for treating DPAGT1-CDG . It is caused by mutations in the gene DPAGT1 which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation . We used a Drosophila rough eye model of DPAGT1-CDG with an improperly developed , small eye phenotype . DPAGT1-CDG is a Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation ( CDG ) that lacks effective therapies . We identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DPAGT1-CDG model .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While it is possible that the N-glycosylation status of a particular targeted protein is important for a specific drug hit , we found no general correlation between N-glycosylation status and suppressor or enhancer hits . It is possible that these MAOIs were enhancers because they increased the amount of DA in the presynaptic neuron , in line with our data on DA synthesis and recycling . We found that drug classes involving acetylcholine signaling , dopamine ( DA ) synthesis , histamine receptors , NKCC1/2 , and cyclooxygenase inhibition might be good candidates for treating DPAGT1-CDG ( Fig 8 ) . While only two NSAIDs improved our model , this category may still be promising for DPAGT1-CDG given their high usage and ease of patient access . We previously found that loss of the deglycosylating enzyme NGLY1 results in reduced NKCC1 activity , and other studies find that inhibiting N-glycosylation reduces the function of NKCC1 and NKCC2 . We hypothesize that under DPAGT1 impairment , any Ncc69 that is expressed may be misglycosylated and subsequently may be misfolded , or have aberrant function , and contribute to disease pathogenesis . While now discontinued in the US ( via PubChem ) , tolmetin was used for decades as an alternative to aspirin and has similarly few side effects . Given that bumetanide improved the eye development of the DPAGT1 model , it also suggests a role for bumetanide-like drugs beyond their use as anti-seizure medications . However , there is also evidence for the use of COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors in treating cognitive deficits and convulsions , both of which are relevant to DPAGT1-CDG . This suggests that our CDG fly model is a reasonable representation of the disorder , and that these models are valuable tools for identifying potential therapeutics . While muscle weakness in patients and the eye defect in the DPAGT1 model are distinct phenotypes , they are connected because both are improved by decreasing breakdown of acetylcholine . Thus , while there may be some sex differences in efficacy , we did not find any completely sex-dependent biological pathways affecting the DPAGT1 model . Alternatively , acetylcholine-mediated DA release may be more prevalent in cells expressing higher levels of D1-like DA receptors , which would prove beneficial . In our model , some drugs may need high concentrations to elicit a phenotype ( e. g. bumetanide ) , while others may have decreased efficacy at too high of a dose ( e. g. nomifensine ) . Bumetanide is typically used as a loop diuretic in patients with edema and hypertension due to its inhibition of NKCC2 in renal tissue . This includes neurons where NKCC1 affects cell polarization and levels of GABA that are important for proper CNS function [ 103-105 ] . Identifying this drug class provides strong validation of our fly model and drug screen , as this class is already used by both DPAGT1-CDG and -CMS patients . We tested multiple drug doses to determine if some doses could provide better partial rescue of our model compared to our initial screen of 5 μM . To that end , bumetanide has been used more recently as an anti-seizure medication in mice and off-label in humans . These findings may help create new treatment options for DPAGT1-CDG , and our validated drug hits represent potential therapeutics for patients . Inhibiting the ion transporter Ncc69 via bumetanide or RNAi resulted in a strong improvement of the DPAGT1 model compared to other treatments . Given the impaired eye development in the DPAGT1 model , these processes may underlie the improvement from ACE inhibition ( and the ostensible increase in acetylcholine ) . However , in Drosophila , glutamate is the excitatory neurotransmitter in NMJs , and the fly eye is likely not impacted by NMJ signaling regardless . However , it also includes acetylcholine receptors , which would be activated by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and ostensibly be beneficial
[METHODS] ",,969,97,None,"DPAGT1-CDG is a congenital disorder of glycosylation ( CDG ) that lacks effective therapies . We used a Drosophila rough eye model to identify drugs that improved its eye phenotype . This model was modified by pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor . Loss of both dopeamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model . Notably , loss of both acetylcholine ( DA ) synthesis , histamine receptors , NKCC1/2 , and cyclooxygenase ( NKCA ) inhibition partially resurrected the model under DA deficiency . These drugs and subsequent analyses reveal novel biology in DPA GT1 mechanisms and represent new therapeutic options for treating D PAGT1–CDG ."

Few neurons will encode just a single joint . The model makes several testable predictions : 1 . 2 . 2 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While the relatively large spacing of electrodes used to record neural data from area 2 does not allow us to confirm the pinwheel anatomical structure directly , there are signatures of it in the recordings , such as the fact that neurons recorded on a given electrode tend to have more similar PDs than those recorded on separate electrodes-a necessary , but not sufficient property for proprioceptive pinwheels . This points towards the importance of working with training data that matches the natural distribution of stimuli when modelling sensory neurons , as it suggests important features of the neural code ( such as the complex receptive fields predicted by our model ) will only be elucidated under these conditions . While it is possible to reproduce the coding properties of individual neurons from convergence of peripheral inputs to a GLM , those models can tell us little about the role of neighbouring cells in shaping receptive fields or neuroanatomy-neural function relationships in general . Our model used only joint-based inputs ( i. e. , the kinematic state or pose of the arm ) but knows nothing about the musculoskeletal mechanics of the limb ( e. g. , the fact that bi-articulate muscles span multiple joints ) , beyond what can be inferred from correlations between joint angles . This enables a lateral interaction term between neighbouring neurons to be added , that shapes cortical activity into local neighbourhoods , allowing it to learn cortical-like spatial structure as well as temporal single-neuron activity patterns , both of which we compare to recorded neural data . Here , we combine natural proprioceptive stimuli with a novel model of neural coding and topographical organization of neurons in somatosensory cortex to help develop our understanding of proprioceptive coding and allowing us to paint a picture beyond that we can see through the restricted lens of neural recordings . The correlations between motion of different joints that we observe in the natural data are substantial ( 4 principal components explain 80 % of the variance of the seven degrees of freedom of the arm ) and are the result of three main factors : 1 ) the biomechanics of the body , including the way many muscles span multiple joints , 2 ) the way the brain controls movements and 3 ) the tasks performed . This observation may be of great importance for the many proprioceptive and motor neurophysiology experiments that have been conducted in highly constrained lab settings , settings that may not contain adequate ethologically relevant kinematic statistics to uncover the true coding of cortical neurons . Core to our approach was allowing the model to learn to represent the statistics of natural human movements rather than stereotyped movements , which under the efficient coding hypothesis is key to understanding sensory representations in the nervous system [ 27 , 37-39 ] . Alternatively , conditional random fields could capture this property without the need for recurrent feedback , by conditioning the probability of a neuron firing on both the input , and the state of neighbouring neurons ( defined by an undirected graph similar to Ψ ) . Furthermore , higher-level features of the modelled neurons , such as PD distributions and the distributions of tuning curve features , were comparable to recorded neurons , particularly when the model was constrained by lateral effects and trained on stimuli that reflected the natural distributions of arm movement ( Figs 2 and 3 ) . Using this same dataset , Ejaz and colleagues showed that the pairwise similarity of finger-specific fMRI activity patterns in human sensorimotor cortex was better explained by the correlation structure of hand movements than muscle activity . Our topo-VAE is designed to reflect information processing in cortex : we hypothesise that the cortex learns , through experience , an efficient representation of the somatosensory world which we replicate here as a deep autoencoder network . It is important to note that there would be

[ABSTRACT] Our data suggests a model in which ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasilense and re-wires its metabolism , suggesting that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing ethylene . Additionally , RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics showed that ethylene causes wide-spread metabolic changes that affect carbon and nitrogen metabolism . Treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces . We demonstrated that Azospirillum brasilense contains a functional ethylene receptor that we call Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 ( AzoEtr1 ) after the nomenclature used in plants . Ethylene is a plant hormone involved in many aspects of plant growth and development as well as responses to stress . The role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions has been explored from the perspective of plants . However , only a small number of studies have examined the role of ethylene in microbes . These data provide potential new targets to regulate beneficial plant-microbe interactions . One result is the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate . AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene with high affinity .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Thus , it is not unexpected that the impact of ethylene perception on bacterial behavior differs between these two organisms One point of similarity is that both organisms are very sensitive to ethylene with responses occurring as low as 1 ppb ethylene , which is below the threshold for most responses in plants . The measurements of these resources allow PII proteins , such as GlnB , to function at the center of the regulation of the balance between cellular carbon and nitrogen metabolism by interacting with many unrelated molecular targets to mediate cellular adaptation [ 68-73 , 77 , 103-106 ] . Ethylene levels in the soil are influenced by various factors , including compaction and water saturation and can range from trace amounts to above 10 ppm , which is well above the levels needed to elicit biological responses in plants [ 20-23 ] . Given the central role of 2-oxoglutarate in signaling to the PII proteins , this represents a possible mechanism by which ethylene shifts metabolism by making the bacteria partially `` blind '' to shifts in nitrogen availability leading to alterations in carbon and nitrogen metabolic processes . This is reflected in the upregulation of carbon metabolism genes such as the 1-phosphofrutokinase pfkB and several genes encoding for components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and downregulation of glnB which regulates the expression of other nitrogen assimilation ( amtB ) and nitrogen fixation ( nifH ) genes . This is similar to what occurs in plants in which multiple isoforms were deleted and has contributed to the idea that there may be feedback inhibition on the receptors to desensitize the plant to ethylene . Thus , another role of plant-derived ethylene may be to act as a cue for A. brasilense to return to a motile life-style , perhaps to avoid competition by other bacteria on the root surface . In this role , ethylene might signal a highly competitive environment , thus signaling A. brasilense to remain a free-living cell and store carbon in the form of PHB for when an environment favorable for attachment occurs . The observation that plants can select some of their rhizospheric bacterial partners implies an exchange of molecular signals to select the most beneficial microorganisms from a diverse pool of candidates in the rhizosphere . In contrast , motility in A. brasilense relies on a single polar flagellum that powers the movement of individual cells , whereas EPS production is required for biofilm formation and attachment . Deleting SynEtr1 results in faster twitching motility of Synechocystis , whereas , deletion of AzoEtr1 has no effect on A. brasilense swimming motility , since the timing of aerotaxis band formation was unaffected . Plants respond to environmental challenges by recruiting different subpopulations of beneficial , non-symbiotic bacteria in the rhizosphere , but little is known about how this selection occurs . This and other data led to an inverse-agonist model for ethylene receptor signaling where in the absence of ethylene , the receptors are inhibiting down-stream signaling ; the binding of ethylene inhibits the receptors leading to activation of down-stream signaling . Given that cyclic di-GMP affects both biofilm formation and metabolism , ethylene may also be affecting the cells by modulating the levels of this second messenger . A. brasilense cells adapt their physiology to respond to changes in the availability of carbon relative to nitrogen in their environment by regulating attachment to roots , flocculation , and biofilm formation [ 84-86 ] . This coupled with the presence of an ethylene receptor in A. brasilense led us to hypothesize that root-derived ethylene affects the recruitment of specific rhizosphere bacteria to the root surface . Thus , the bacterial ethylene receptors may have roles in addition to mediating responses to ethylene or there may be feedback mechanisms on the receptors that reduce responses to ethylene as observed in plants . In plants , the ethylene receptors predominantly signal via a his-kinase-independent mechanism to a ser/thr protein kinase which functions

[ABSTRACT] These data suggest a role for INO80 in DNA repair factor localization , thereby facilitating the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachynema . The INO80 protein is the main catalytic subunit of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex , which is critical for DNA repair and transcription regulation in murine spermatocytes . A reduction in the recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition ( MSCI ) argues for INO80-facilitated recruitment of DNA repair factors required for silencing sex-linked genes . Furthermore , the active form of RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes of Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes . Instead , in the absence of INO80 , a reduction in chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites occurs on the sex chromosomes . In this study , we explored the role of INO80 in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice . INO80 immunolocalization at the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes suggested a role for INO80 in the meiotic sex body . Subsequent deletion of Ino80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes . This role of INO80 is independent of a common INO80 target , H2A . Z .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While the exact mechanism of gene silencing by DSB factors is not clear , the de novo generation of accessible regions at the non-promoter areas may provide the open chromatin structure necessary for DSB factors to bind and , therefore , explain the resulting gene silencing by them during MSCI . Moreover , unaltered gene expression signatures for zygonema and pachynema stages in Ino80cKO spermatocytes at P18 , derived from RNAseq data comparing Ino80WT and Ino80cKo spermatocytes , suggest their relative proportions remain similar , except for a reduced transition from pachynema to diplonema in the absence of INO80 . Utilizing this small window of time , we observed a lack of downregulation of sex-linked differentially expressed genes in Ino80cKO spermatocytes , which was also replicated by comparing homogeneous pachynema populations upon synchronization of spermatogenesis . However , it is logical to predict INO80 as a central regulator of sex-linked gene silencing by regulating this de novo accessibility generation , as most of these peaks are lost in Ino80cKO spermatocytes . However , INO80-dependent silencing of sex-linked genes in meiotic spermatocytes is independent of INO80-mediated direct transcriptional regulation by enabling DNA binding factor recruitment at the promoter-proximal areas . X-binding DSB regions and reduced MDC1 occupancy at the DA sites in sex chromosomes due to Ino80 deletion indicate a possible INO80-dependent recruiting mechanism for DSBR factor MDC1 . We also validated this overall aberrant sex-linked transcription program in individual Ino80cKO pachytene spermatocytes by immunolocalizing active RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes . Further , recent studies have reported a mechanistic view of the role of INO80 in sliding hexasomes and nucleosomes with different affinities to create accessible DNA . Here , we propose that INO80 mediates the de novo opening of chromatin around the DSB regions and facilitates recruitment of MDC1 , whereby MDC1 initiates γH2A . An earlier report showed that male germ cell-specific deletion of Ino80 results in a meiotic arrest phenotype in 8-week-old murine testes . However , during the first wave of spermatogenesis in juvenile mice , no significant cell death was observed in Ino80cKO testis up to P21 . INO80 also regulates somatic gene silencing at the autosomes in spermatocytes by promoting H3K27me3 modification at promoters , while H3K4me3 remains unaffected . A significant population of pachytene spermatocytes display defects in synapsis and DNA damage response , leading to the loss of spermatocytes in adult testes . We also demonstrated that INO80 interacts with DSBR factors ATR and MDC1 , facilitating MDC1 recruitment at the sex chromosomes during pachynema . We observed an increase in overall chromatin accessibility at promoter regions of autosomes and sex chromosomes during meiotic progression . In contrast , a similar level of accessibility remains at the promoter-proximal areas of sex chromosomes due to Ino80 deletion . It facilitates the recruitment of RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) and its cofactors to the promoters of pluripotency network genes . It can also regulate gene expression by facilitating histone modifications and the exchange of histone variants such as H2A . Several other studies also reported similar characteristics that described roles for MSCI-regulating factors [ 6 , 38-40 ] . Several studies have described a regulatory role for INO80 in DNA damage response in somatic cells and meiosis . We also found that INO80 interacts with DNA repair factors ATR and MDC1 in meiotic spermatocytes . In this study , we demonstrated a unique role for INO80 in silencing sex-linked genes during pachynema in spermatocytes . Chromatin accessibility is also essential in transcription factor recruitment and efficient transcription regulation at the promoter-proximal areas . previously reported that the accessibility at the promoter/TSS during the pachynema transition remains relatively unchanged . It is possible that chromatin accessibility is dynamic , and changes occur between stages during spermatogenesis . The INO80 chromatin remodeling complex interacts with DNA damage factors such as γH2A . It is unclear whether hexasomes facilitate INO80-interaction at the meiotic sex chromosomes

[ABSTRACT] We find that the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the cdd-2 defect in axon regeneration . These results suggest that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor through modification of svh-1 mRNA . SVH-1 is a dual-function factor that acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a protease to regulate early development . Furthermore , the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1 . The pathway for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans is activated by SVH-1 , a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family . In this study , we demonstrate that cytidine deaminase ( CDD ) SVH-17/CDD-2 plays a role in the functional conversion of SVH-1 . It is important to understand how SVH-1 is converted from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] However , in contrast to this scenario , the protease-active and growth factor-active isoforms of SVH-1 act in the same cell ( ADL neuron ) to regulate larval development during the L1 stage and axon regeneration during the L4-adult stages , respectively . Our genetic results suggest that CDD-2 deaminates the C of svh-1 mRNA to U , replacing His-755 ( CAU ) with tyrosine ( UAU ) in the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad , producing a protease-inactive and growth factor-active SVH-1 . Furthermore , although the svh-1 reporter gene with the nls : :venus-fused svh-1 promoter demonstrated expression exclusively in ADL neurons , data from the CeNGEN project indicated that transcripts of svh-1 were detected in other neurons in addition to ADL neurons . Thus , the protease-inactive SVH-1 ( S898F ) can function as a growth factor only when His-755 is substituted with Tyr-755 in svh-1 mRNA by CDD-2 , suggesting that SVH-1 with His-755 can not interact with or activate SVH-2 . Forced cdd-2 expression at the L1 stage does not lead to the editing of svh-1 mRNA , suggesting that the enzymatic activity of CDD-2 may be activated by axon injury . Thus , cdd-2 expression at a specific developmental stage is essential for the functional conversion of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor during axon regeneration . Upon axon injury , CDD-2-dependent editing and subsequent translation of svh-1 mRNA occurs , resulting in the production of SVH-1 ( H755Y ) , a protein with growth factor activity . Therefore , CDD-2-mediated inactivation of the SVH-1 protease activity should not occur during the L1 stage ; cdd-2 is only expressed at a later , distinct developmental stage . The cytidine editing site in ApoB mRNA is located within a stem-loop secondary structure , which is important for RNA recognition by editing factors . In this way , APOBEC-1 enables the synthesis of full-length ( ApoB100 ) and short isoforms ( ApoB48 ) of ApoB from a single mRNA . This RNA-editing process converts a specific glutamine codon ( CAA ) into a premature termination codon ( UAA ) , resulting in a C-terminal truncated ApoB48 protein . Our genetic analysis suggests that the stem-loop structure of svh-1 mRNA is required for SVH-1 function in axon regeneration . Interestingly , recent biochemical analyses have revealed that both svh-1 mRNA and CDD-2 protein are entrapped in extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) . Thus , the Tyr-755 form of SVH-1 loses protease activity but gains the ability to act as a growth factor . If CDD-2 activity is activated by axon injury , detecting svh-1 mRNA-editing within animals would be more difficult . These results raise the possibility that EVs containing svh-1 mRNA and CDD-2 are delivered from ADL neurons to D neurons . In this study , we demonstrate that CDD-2 converts the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor . Similarly , in svh-1 mRNA , the His-755 encoding CAU codon is within a stem-loop secondary structure . APOBEC-1 has general AU-binding activity , and CDD-2 also possesses RNA-binding activity with an affinity for AU-rich RNA templates . In this scenario , axon injury to D-type motor neurons should induce CDD-2-dependent svh-1 mRNA-editing . Nevertheless , both svh-1 and cdd-2 are expressed and function in ADL neurons , which are spatially distant from D-type neurons . Therefore , it is necessary to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms governing svh-1 mRNA-editing by CDD-2 . However , no biochemical evidence exists that CDD-2 catalyzes the editing of svh-1 mRNA in animals . Although the svh-1 ( S898F ) mutant loses protease activity , it fails to suppress the cdd-2 defect . Therefore , CDD-2 specifically changes the His-755 of SVH-1 to a motif that can activate SVH-2 . We propose that this secondary structural component of svh-1 mRNA is recognized by CDD-2 . Second , the His-755 form of SVH-1 does not function as a growth factor . Tissue-specific editing of ApoB mRNA is an important factor in lipid metabolism . Consequently ,
[METHODS] ",,935,95,None,"SVH-1 is a dual-function factor that acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a protease to regulate early development .

We find that the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad of svh-1 can suppress the ddd-2 defect in aXon regeneration . Furthermore , the stem hairpin structure around the His-7555 site in svah-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axiaon regeneration by SVHO-1 , a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family . These results suggest that CDD-2 promotes a xon regeneration by transforming the function of SKH-1 from a protein to a grow factor through modification of its mDNA ."

[ABSTRACT] We show that the collective behaviour of wildtype and col11a2 -/- zebrafish are captured with a simple active matter model , in which the mutant fish are modelled by self-propelling agents with a higher orientational noise on average . In a few cases , the system may be controlled at the level of the individual constituents such as the interactions between colloidal particles , or the enzymatic behaviour of de novo proteins . Zebrafish collective behaviour is widely used to assess their physical and mental state , serving as a valuable tool to assess the impact of ageing , disease genetics , and the effect of drugs . In this way , we demonstrate the possibility of tuning a biological system , changing the state space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active matter model . The essence of these macroscopic phenomena can be represented by active matter models , where the individuals are abstracted as interactive self-propelling agents . We thus demonstrate the potential of genetic modification in the context of controlling the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems at the level of the constituents , rather than externally . The resulting col11a2 -/- zebrafish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties , bent their body less while swimming , and took longer to change their orientations . Usually , however , while the collective behaviour may be influenced by environmental factors , it typically can not be changed at will . The behaviour of these agents depends on a set of parameters in a manner reminiscent of those between the constituents of physical systems . In particular , we probe the effect of the lack of col11a2 gene in zebrafish , which causes the early onset of osteoarthritis . Surprisingly , a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype . Here , we challenge this scenario in a biological context by genetically modifying zebrafish .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Taken together we have shown that by modelling the swimming behaviour of zebrafish and treating them as active matter , we can reveal physiologically relevant behaviours that are underpinned by changes to the skeleton , demonstrating the utility of this approach as a tool to follow genetic mutants and relate behaviours to genetic traits and to phsyiological changes within the body . This behavioural difference of a single fish affected the group behaviour of twenty five , where the mutant fish group exhibited more ordered collective motion that correlates with their more persistent swimming style . This is interpreted as the mutant fish system adopting a different state space with respect to the wild-type in the context of a minimalistic physical model . In particular the difference between mutant and wild-type fish can be summarised by different orientational noise level in a modified Vicsek model . The genetic modification caused defects in the vertebral column of mutants , leading to less body-bending in swimming , hence a slower reorientation process . Our work describes a quantitative study on the behavioural difference between wild-type zebrafish and the col11a2 -/- zebrafish whose col11a2 gene is knocked out ( suppressed ) . In other words , we have tuned the behaviour of a biological system in a manner reminiscent of synthetic colloids or de novo proteins .

[ABSTRACT] The results revealed that the capillary-like networks could develop in high integrity only when the mechanical and chemical couplings worked adequately , with the cell morphology and haptotaxis driven by the soluble and bound forms of VEGF , respectively , functioning simultaneously . By bridging the mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation in the model , the results showed good agreement between the predicted network topology and experiments , in which elongated cells connected , forming the network cords and round cells gathered , creating cobblestone-like aggregates . We used the Cellular Potts model to predict individual cell migration , morphology change , and continuum mechanics to quantify biogel deformation and VEGF transport dynamics . However , the mechanisms connecting mechanical and chemical stimuli remained undefined , and the functions of the different VEGF forms in the culture environment were still unclear . In this paper , we developed a hybrid model for simulating short-term in vitro capillary incubations . Theoretical simulations have been conducted to supplement the expensive experimental works . Capillary plexus cultivation is crucial in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Furthermore , for the practical transplantation into living bodies to promote neovascularization around the surgical site , an extension of our model may cover the extracellular remodeling and endothelial cell morphology in the future . The soluble VEGF in the culture medium induces morphological changes , and the bound VEGF on the biogel surface provides oriental signals , both playing roles in forming the capillary-like networks . The results were consistent with the experiments , showing that the cellular network was well-developed if the mechanical and chemical coupling worked simultaneously . We have developed a comprehensive model encompassing mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation cues for forming capillary-like networks .

Typically studied as homodimers , these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that may enhance , repress , or generate novel functions . In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , there are only five TGF-β ligands , providing an opportunity to dissect ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates .

The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans . Here we show that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogens . We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs act nonredundantly as part of this response . Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers . [ INTRODUCTION ] [ RESULTS ] [ DISCUSSION ] These studies were initiated with the well-characterized BMP-like DBL-1 signaling pathway , which is associated with significant roles in development and body size regulation but has also been shown to play an important role in the immune response against both bacterial and fungal pathogens . Interaction between BMP and TGFβ/Activin subfamily members may provide a mechanism for distinguishing developmental and homeostatic ligand functions from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens . The nematode C. elegans has five TGF-β ligands and two characterized TGF-β family signaling pathways , providing a powerful in vivo system in which to study TGF-β ligand functions in the context of an intact organism . These results suggest that the function of DBL-1 in the immune response is not a general one-size-fits-all response to bacterial pathogen but rather a more nuanced response with some level of pathogen specificity . However , joint action between a BMP and TGF-β/Activin ligand , including potential cross-subfamily heterodimers , has not yet been described in vertebrates to our knowledge , and warrants further consideration . The TGF-β/Activin-like ligands DAF-7 and TIG-3 demonstrated consistently significant reduced survival patterns on P. luminescens , suggesting involvement of these ligands in the response to this bacterial pathogen . We have shown that SMA-3/Smad is required in pharyngeal muscle for survival on bacterial pathogens , so TIG-2 and TIG-3 are produced in a location appropriate for signaling to SMA-3/Smad in the pharynx . It is possible that activation of SMA-2 in a sma-3 mutant background partially compensates for the loss of sma-3 and that this activation is lacking in tig-2dbl-1 and tig-3 ; dbl-1 double mutants , causing a more severe phenotype . qRT-PCR analysis of TGF-β ligand expression shows that with 24-hour exposure to bacterial infection , expression levels of the ligands do not significantly change from control conditions . Furthermore , two ligand pairs consisting of a BMP subfamily and a TGF-β/Activin subfamily member ( TIG-2/TIG-3 and DBL-1/DAF-7 ) show evidence of interacting in the response to gram-negative bacterium P. luminescens . Biochemical and computational approaches are useful in identifying the principles mediating the potential protein-protein interactions between these components , but these approaches must be complemented by functional in vivo analyses . The phenotypic similarities provide evidence that TIG-2 and TIG-3 signal through the canonical BMP signaling pathway consisting of SMA-6 Type I receptor and SMA-2 , SMA-3 , and SMA-4 Smads in the context of bacterial pathogen survival . Taken together , we conclude that all five of the TGF-β ligands play a role in the immune response , but not at the level of transcriptional induction . In addition to heterodimers , nonredundant functions of TGF-β ligands can be explained by a receptor clustering mechanism that generates higher-order signaling complexes . The multiplicity of TGF-β family ligands , receptors , and Smad signal transducers may support the generation of diverse context-dependent outcomes through combinatorial interactions . For example , in endothelial cells , TGF-β can phosphorylate presumptive BMP Smads Smad1/5 through interaction with type I receptor ALK1 rather than ALK5 . We have not determined why the sma-3 survival defect is not worse than that of tig-2 or tig-3 mutants , as the tig-2dbl-1 and tig-3 ; dbl-1 phenotypes are . Furthermore , the BMP receptor ALK2 ( ACVR1 ) can be activated by Activin to phosphorylate Smad1/5 , and this activity is increased by pathogenic FOP mutations . Furthermore , we show that DBL-1/BMP and TIG-2/BMP have additive roles in the response to P. luminescens , suggesting that they trigger independent responses .

[ABSTRACT] Delving deeper into its effects on the DNA damage signaling cascade , nat4-deleted cells exhibit lower levels of the damage-induced modification H2AS129ph ( γH2A ) , accompanied by diminished binding of the checkpoint control protein Rad9 surrounding the double-strand break . Here , we show that the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 ( Nat4 ) , known to acetylate the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2A , is implicated in the response to DNA damage in S. cerevisiae . Importantly , we found that the effects of Nat4 in regulating the checkpoint signaling cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4 . Overall , this study points towards a novel functional link between histone N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and the DDR , associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity . Initially , we demonstrate that yeast cells lacking Nat4 have an increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells . Consistently , Mec1 kinase recruitment at double-strand breaks , critical for H2AS129ph deposition and Rad9 retention , is significantly impaired in nat4Δ cells . Accordingly , upon DNA damage , NAT4 gene expression is elevated , and the enzyme is specifically recruited at double-strand breaks . Consequently , Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effector kinase Rad53 , indicative of DNA damage checkpoint activation , is reduced . This biological process involves substantial alterations in chromatin structure , commonly orchestrated by epigenetic enzymes . The DNA damage response ( DDR ) constitutes a vital cellular process that safeguards genome integrity .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Remarkably , we found that there is substantial reduction in Mec1 ( Figs 3D , 4C and 6D ) and Rad9 ( Fig 3C ) enrichment at the induced DSBs in nat4Δ cells but , this is not reflected in Rad53 phosphorylation whose reduction is considerably less pronounced ( Figs 3E , 4D and 6E ) . In Nat4-deficient cells , we observed reduced recruitment of Mec1 ( Figs 3D , 4C and 6D ) whose loss is known to indirectly accelerate resection by affecting Rad9 binding at DSB sites [ 24 , 25 , 30 , 35-38 , 51 ] . Additionally , we showed that in nat4Δ cells there is defective DDC activation , evident by reduced Rad53 phosphorylation ( Figs 3E , 4D and 6E ) , while it was previously shown that DNA end resection is inhibited in a checkpoint-dependent manner . In summary , our work unveils a new role for Nat4 in DDR , which serves as a paradigm among the NAT family of enzymes and their mediated protein N-terminal acetylation in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage . Since these Set2-associated effects are similar to the results presented here for nat4Δ and the H4S1A mutant , future work could explore the interplay between these and other epigenetic modifiers upon DNA damage to control the DDR . 6kb > 2kb > 3kb ) of Nat4 to the DSB , strongly supporting its spreading outwards from the cut-site ( Fig 2D ) , a profile that resembles the spatial organization of DDR-related proteins that are recruited in response to the generation of a DSB . This study expands the repertoire of histone modifiers implicated in DDR by shedding light on a novel function for Nat4 N-terminal acetyltransferase in regulating the response to DNA damage and checkpoint dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . In this study , we show through ChIP experiments that Nat4 is enriched on chromatin after an HO-induced DSB , and it is specifically localized at areas adjacent to the DSB ( Fig 2D ) . It was shown that this non-canonical signaling of Rad53 activation operates when Mec1 function is compromised , and remains to be seen whether it also functions normally to activate Rad53 in Mec1-intact cells . It is also worth noting that Nat4 recruitment to DSBs occurs irrespective of its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity since catalytically inactive Nat4 is still enriched at sites adjacent to the DSB ( Fig 2D ) . Considering that Nat4 and its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity towards histone H4 is preserved from yeast to humans , we envision that its human ortholog NAA40 may be linked to processes safeguarding the genome . Specifically , it has been shown that Set2 is required for the DDR activation , since its deletion results in the reduction of H2AS129ph , both globally and surrounding an HO-induced break . Intriguingly , in a previous study it was shown that under physiological conditions Nat4 acts synergistically with these three lysine residues to regulate cell growth and silencing of ribosomal DNA genes . Although , the recruitment data here support a direct function for Nat4 at the DSB , we can not exclude the possibility that Nat4 also mediates its effect in DDR through its previously reported transcriptional activity . Our findings highlight the essential role of Nat4 N-terminal activity towards histone H4 for optimal recruitment of Mec1 at an HO-induced DSB ( Figs 3D , 4C and 6D ) . Nat4 has been reported to work as a monomer , however the above binding pattern might suggest that Nat4 may be recruited in a dynamic manner together with other DDR factors . One possibility is that Nat4 and its mediated Nt-AcH4 could be cross-talking with other histone modifications

[ABSTRACT] Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALLs ) . Additionally , we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations . Phylogenies depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer , i. e. , cancer phylogenies , offer valuable insights about cancer development and guide treatment strategies . However , these methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations , or , in some cases , fail to recover a phylogeny altogether . Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially , generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations . Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies , a novel result derived in this paper . Here , we introduce Orchard , a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate using up to 1000 mutations . Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny . Many methods exist that reconstruct cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing . Remarkably , Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies using up to 1 , 000 mutations .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] One potential improvement , because the frequency of most mutations should not be changed by introducing a new mutation into the tree , is developing a new version of the projection algorithm that only performs local updates to the U matrix . We anticipate that improvements to the current algorithm to make it probabilistic , so that its merging choices are made based on an appropriate likelihood function , will result in even greater performance . Our results demonstrate that Orchard can reliably match or beat ground-truth ( or expert-derived ) baselines on tree reconstruction problems with up to 300 mutations and up to 100 samples from the same cancer . Although the computational complexity for estimating U is , at worst , quadratic in the number of mutations ( i. e. , rows ) in U , the wall clock times grows quickly with increasing problem size , beam width ( k ) , or branching factor ( f ) . Also , Orchard marginalizes over all possible ways to place a new mutation into a partially built tree , which requires an exponential number of evaluations when the tree is a star tree , i. e. , a tree where all mutations are children of the root . Despite this , the algorithm already matches , or in some cases , outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic VAF-based clustering algorithms on real data ( see Section A6 . We derived an approximation to the mutation tree posterior , then showed how Orchard adapts Ancestral Gumbel-Top-k sampling to efficiently sample without replacements from it . Orchard 's ability to reconstruct extremely large trees motivated a new strategy where the mutation tree structure is used to guide the inference of clones and clone trees . The Orchard algorithm could also be adapted to reconstruct mutation trees from single-cell data , though this requires updating Orchard 's noise model and sampling routine to accommodate single cell data . First , the majority of Orchard 's run time is used by the projection algorithm to estimate the clonal proportion matrix U each time it adds a new mutation to a tree . For example , these trees could be used to study patterns of somatic mutations , recover lineage-specific mutation signature activities , or identify patterns of metastatic spread . Until now , existing mixed sample perfect phylogeny ( MSPP ) reconstruction algorithms were unable to reliably reconstruct trees with more than 30 mutations . Fortunately , under the ISA , such trees are uncommon and linear branching becomes more likely as the number of children for a node increases . We introduced Orchard , a novel MSPP reconstruction algorithm that uses variant allele frequency data to build large and accurate mutation trees . 4 in S1 Appendix we use Orchard to successfully reconstruct 1000-node simulated mutation trees in ≈26 hours of wall clock time . This vast amount of data presents a promising opportunity to improve our understanding of the evolutionary events that drive cancer progression . These limitations necessitated clustering mutations into subclones prior to reconstructing trees , which is an error prone process [ 30-32 ] . The current implementation of the `` phylogeny-aware '' clustering algorithm uses a non-probabilistic merging strategy to identify clones in a mutation tree . Unless specified otherwise , Orchard will try all 2ℓ + ℓ possible ways to place a new mutation into a star tree with ℓ mutations . To this end , we introduced a `` phylogeny-aware '' clustering algorithm that uses agglomerative clustering to infer clones and clone trees from mutation trees . Modern cancer evolution studies generate large amounts of bulk sequencing data often containing hundreds of mutations and multiple cancer samples . These results suggest that the mutation tree structure is useful for guiding the inference of clones and clones

[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The current version of the model places more positional importance on known biologically relevant locations ; however , future version of the model will need to be reassessed in this manner to ensure spurious features are n't learned from any new datasets , which may not be apparent from benchmark scores alone . In our tests EL models perform very poorly on immunogenicity prediction due to the bias in which epitopes are tested being skewed to highly ranked epitopes ; however , these tools are still likely useful for minimal epitope selection compared to randomly selected epitopes from a given mutation . ImmugenX as an architecture demonstrated strong performance at two TCR specificity tasks from previous publications indicating that it is highly capable of integrating TCR inputs , including up to full chain alpha and beta chains , into predictions . The SHAP analysis of ImmugenX showed a more balanced use of residues in the immunogenicity-trained full model compared to the underlying pMHC sub-module trained on the BA , EL and stability tasks which was highly impacted by the associated HLA binding motifs . There exists a potential bias in reactivity datasets due to the use of BA/EL models to determine test candidates from called mutations , since these tools have biases associated with their training data acquisition methods . In this work , we 've described ImmugenX , a modular language model which achieves state-of-the-art performance on pMHC immunogenicity prediction and can integrate new inputs such as TCRs when available . The phased pre-training approach detailed here allows for the integration of multiple pMHC complex-specific tasks in the model weights , providing a useful embedding for downstream pMHC immunogenicity modelling at state-of-the-art performance levels . We found the recall of immunogenic epitopes with low average scores on associated features such as EL rank and stability was poor in both ImmugenX and BigMHC , the next best model tested . ImmugenX provides a strong framework for immunogenicity prediction using a modular protein language model which achieves state-of-the-art level performance at predicting immunogenicity on publicly available CD8+ reactivity data . TCR input was found to have the least impact on the overall prediction score ; however , the shift in performance seen here indicates the patient TCR repertoire could be an important input in improving neoepitope ranking . Our protein language modelling approach has the advantage of not just integrating other model outputs , but additional features which are observable in the underlying embeddings before the immunogenicity model head . Our work indicates paired TCR datasets in particular would be highly valuable for both improving epitope level immunogenicity prediction and providing a patient-specific context to the model . The ImmugenX architecture has the advantage of being extendable , both to additional pre-training-based embeddings through new pMHC tasks and to additional feature inputs such as TCR sequences . The phased training approach used in ImmugenX allows for the possible inclusion of TCR data , without being limited by the low volume of paired peptide-TCR data available for training an end-to-end model . This was shown with a strict separation of datasets , ensuring all test peptides were unseen by the model in any previous task at every point of training . Similarly , structural features may improve the performance in future , especially when considering TCR inputs ; however , the low volume of known triplet structures makes this challenging . We show that integrating CDR3β chains into an immunogenicity prediction task can provide an improvement in performance in the limited set of test neoantigens currently available . pMHC complex stability in particular was found to be an important additional embedded feature for improved performance on the test set in this work . Due to the limited datasets available , TCR specificity prediction in entirely novel epitopes has not been shown once dataset biases have been sufficiently accounted for . In particular , there is a disconnect between BA or EL predictions and CD8+

[ABSTRACT] The differences in meat color phenotypes , myoglobin content , frequency of rs315520807 variant , expression of PPP1CC and fast-twitch fiber marker genes were detected between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens . Here , we used the genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and gene-based association analysis with whole-genome resequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to map genes related to meat lightness and redness to a 6 . In this study , PPP1CC was identified as the causative gene for meat color , and the novel target gene and variant that can aid in the innovation of meat improvement technology were detected . Through transcriptome and targeted metabolome evidence , we found that inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of typical slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes and enhanced the glycolysis pathway . Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout ( PPP1CC-SSKO ) mice were generated and these mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in the limb muscles . Functional validation through a plasmid reporter assay revealed that a SNP located in the intron of PPP1CC could regulate the gene transcription activity . This analysis revealed that only the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma ( PPP1CC ) was associated with meat color ( P = 8 . The causal relationships between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness/redness were further validated through Mendelian randomization analyses ( P < 2 .

[ABSTRACT] STR can potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within only a few tens of minutes of recording time , making it ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings . Simulations demonstrate that this approach can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations , and application in recordings of primate parasol ganglion cells validates the experimental feasibility . Here , we combine concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography and introduce super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ) as a technique to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits . It arises from the nonlinear transmission of signals that ganglion cells receive from bipolar cells , which thereby constitute functional subunits within a ganglion cell 's receptive field . This calls for efficient methods , which leave sufficient experimental time to leverage the acquired knowledge for further investigating identified subunits . Inferring these subunits from recorded ganglion cell activity promises a new avenue for studying the functional architecture of the retina . Spatially nonlinear stimulus integration by retinal ganglion cells lies at the heart of various computations performed by the retina .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] For a complex cell that prefers edges of a particular orientation , for example , such a stimulus might be a localized , sharp black-white edge whose intensity profile rapidly falls off as one moves away from the black-white transition , or it might comprise an edge with sidebands of opposing contrast on both sides , analogous to the center-surround structure of the Ricker stripes . In theory , by identifying all subunit layouts , relating subunit properties to bipolar cell types and studying the transmission strength of each bipolar to ganglion cell type by targeted stimuli , a fairly complete functional connectome of this part of the retina might be in reach , at least as far as connections with sufficiently nonlinear transmission are concerned . We believe the same effect to apply in our tomographic approach with super-resolution stimuli for subunit identification , as Ricker stripes constitute a much more potent stimulus for driving ganglion cells than small spots with suppressive rings or spatiotemporal white noise at the required high spatial resolution ( Fig 4 ) . Nevertheless , in future applications , a general line of thought to follow when deciding on the parameters of the Ricker stripes would be to choose their width w to be similar to or slightly smaller than the expected diameter of subunits and increase the sideband strength s as much as the evoked responses permit to sharpen the contributions of individual subunits . While On and Off parasol ganglion cells in the primate retina are often considered to receive most of their excitatory synaptic input from a single type of bipolar cells each , namely diffuse bipolar cells DB4 and DB3a , respectively , other bipolar cell types may also contribute substantially [ 39-43 ] . More generally , an essential design principle that underlies subunit identification with STR is the application of a stimulus structure that can strongly trigger individual subunits but simultaneously restricts the positions in the probed stimulus space at which responses will occur , so that the effective subunit overlap is reduced . This design principle should be transferrable also to other sensory systems , e. g. , by designing auditory stimuli , potentially combined with quasi-tomographic presentation in spectro-temporal space to increase response strength of putative subunits , for identification of functional circuitry underlying nonlinear computations . Bars of light have long been used to qualitatively study receptive field properties of visual neurons , and Sun and Bonds introduced the application of filtered back-projection to quantitatively determine the receptive fields of cells in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) . By knowing the subunit locations , targeted stimuli can be manufactured to characterize the spatiotemporal integration properties , nonlinearities and functional synaptic weight of each subunit , and evaluate their similarity across multiple subunits within one ganglion cell receptive field . A subunit not quite centered with regard to the stimulus is excited by the central spot , but simultaneously `` depleted '' , i. e. , suppressed , by the ring of opposing contrast , just like the fluorescence signal from an off-center molecule in STED microscopy is suppressed by the depletion ring surrounding the center of the excitation . Our simulations suggest that far less than half an hour of recording time can be sufficient ( Fig 4H ) , and we partly also observed significant hotspot structures in FBPs from relatively short experimental measurements ( Fig 8G ) . Since this could also make reconstructions of layouts with large numbers of subunits feasible ( Fig 4I ) , STR could be useful for resolving the discrepancy between the higher number of subunits expected from anatomical studies compared to findings in functional studies . Simultaneous recordings of connected bipolar cells , as previously performed in the salamander retina , might help assess whether identified subunits do indeed represent bipolar cell receptive fields , but such experiments have been difficult , in particular in the mammalian retina .

[ABSTRACT] sgRNA efficiency interacts in a non-linear way with drug sensitivity , producing an effect where the concentration-dependence is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength ( and less so for sgRNAs that induce too much or too little target depletion ) . However , for noisier datasets , some of these methods generate far more significant interactions , likely including many false positives , whereas CRISPRi-DR maintains higher precision , which we observed in both empirical and simulated data . To capture this interaction , we propose a novel statistical method called CRISPRi-DR ( for Dose-Response model ) that incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation . This approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets , which we show via an CRISPRi dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources . The objective is to identify CRISPRi mutants whose relative abundance is suppressed ( or enriched ) in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted , reflecting synergistic behavior . We use CRISPRi-DR to re-analyze data from a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify genes that interact with antibiotics . Discovery of genes that interact with exposure to antibiotics can yield insights to drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance . Different sgRNAs for a given target can induce a wide range of protein depletion and differential effects on growth rate . We observe that the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs . For essential genes , sgRNA efficiency can be empirically measured by quantifying effects on growth rate . An important application of CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) technology is for identifying chemical-genetic interactions ( CGIs ) . However , the actual growth phenotype depends on the sensitivity of cells to depletion of the target protein . The effect of sgRNA strength can be partially predicted based on sequence features . The performance is competitive with the best of several related analytical methods .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While CRISPRi libraries can be constructed with multiple sgRNAs per target , most CRISPR analytical methods do not explicitly handle such , and those that do ( such as MAGeCK-RRA and CRISPhieRmix ) are essentially designed to identify significant genes by focusing on a subset of apparently effective sgRNAs ( i. e. allowing for ineffective sgRNAs , which are filtered out for each target ) . Using the joint criterion for significance based on the empirical Bayes FDR analysis and the Wald test in CRISPRi-DR partially helps to mitigate this , producing a more focused list of candidate interactions and eliminating genes with small random slopes of concentration dependence that are not likely to be genuine interactions ( i. e. false positives ) . For example , in re-analysis of data from the Mathis , Otto and Reynolds paper , we showed the same equation could be adapted for modeling the effect of E. coli cultures grown on medium with different carbon sources ; the time parameter could be substituted for the concentration , since depletion of essential genes caused a gradual killing with an S-curve shape over time . MAGeCK-MLE is the only other analytical method that take sgRNA efficiencies as an input ; in that method , the empirical measures of efficiency are used to initialize the prior probability that each sgRNA is effective ( assuming each gene is represented by a subset of sgRNAs that are effective and others that are not ) , which is combined with other conditional probabilities in a Bayesian framework to determine the posterior probability of interaction for each gene . Our CRISPRi-DR model incorporates both sgRNA efficiency and drug concentration as parameters , and captures the non-linear interaction between them , where the `` slopes '' for the effect of drug concentration on relative abundance of mutants can be larger in magnitude for sgRNAs of intermediate efficiency , while being flatter ( slopes closer to 0 ) for sgRNAs of high or low efficiency . In contrast , typically , all the sgRNAs targeting a non-essential will turn out to be non-efficient ( i. e. have 0 growth defect , or relative fitness of around 1 ) , at least under control conditions , since the cells are unaffected by depletion of these proteins and continue to grow at the same rate . Their library design guidance is to prefer more efficient sgRNAs ( e. g. Rule Set 1 selects top 20 % of sgRNAs by empirical efficiency and uses these to build a model to predict sgRNA strength ; Rule Set 2 extends this with a machine learning model based on additional sequence features to predict sgRNA strength , and prefers sgRNAs with highest score ) . One might expect to observe a depletion effect due to either increasing sgRNA efficiency , or drug concentration , each producing regression `` slopes '' ( in log-transformed space ) , with slopes for sgRNAs targeting non-essential genes being expected to be flat , regardless of predicted sgRNA strength . The importance of incorporating both inputs in CRISPRi-DR was demonstrated via an experiment with ablated models ; the model fits ( AICs ) for each gene were significantly worse for models that regressed abundances against either drug concentration or sgRNA efficiency alone . Ideally , interacting genes would be expected to exhibit synergistic behavior with a drug , where depletion of a target protein induces excess depletion ( or enrichment ) of the mutants grown in the presence of an inhibitor , and this effect is concentration-dependent

[ABSTRACT] Using RNAseq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster , we show that ( a ) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods , that ( b ) several of those gene groups are not modular , and that ( c ) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities . These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks . For this , we use a recently developed community detection method , the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model ( SBM ) , that does not assume that assortative modules exist . While it is reasonable to expect that these modules exist , using methods that assume they exist a priori is risky , as it guarantees that alternative organizations of gene interactions will be ignored . Most community detection algorithms expect genes to be organized into assortative modules , that is , groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups . Instead , the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes . Here , we ask : can we find meaningful communities without imposing a modular organization on gene co-expression networks , and how modular are these communities ? Finding communities in gene co-expression networks is a common first step toward extracting biological insight from these complex datasets .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] More studies using methods that do n't rely on modularity maximization will be needed to determine whether there are general patterns of non-modular organization . Here , we find that non-modular blocks are widespread in gene co-expression networks , and that the evidence for their functional relevance is as strong as for modular blocks . This highlights the need to incorporate other sources of information , beyond assortativity , when exploring biological networks .

[ABSTRACT] Defects in translation initiation and the stabilization of specific classes of mRNAs in pab1Δ cells appear to be partly indirect consequences of reduced levels of specific initiation factors , decapping activators , and components of the deadenylation complex in addition to the general loss of Pab1 's direct role in these processes . To understand both the direct and indirect roles of PABPC in more detail , we have employed mass spectrometry to assess the abundance of the components of the yeast proteome , as well as RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq to analyze changes in the abundance and translation of the yeast transcriptome , in cells lacking the PAB1 gene . Cytoplasmic poly ( A ) -binding protein ( PABPC ; Pab1 in yeast ) is thought to be involved in multiple steps of post-transcriptional control , including translation initiation , translation termination , and mRNA decay . Collectively , our results indicate that , unlike the loss of simpler regulatory proteins , elimination of cellular Pab1 is profoundly pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcriptional regulation . We find that pab1Δ cells manifest drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome , as well as defects in translation initiation and termination . Cells devoid of Pab1 also manifested a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] However , Pab1 's direct role in termination is still implied because i ) 3'-UTR length , which approximates the distance of Pab1 to the stop codon , lost its ability to predict readthrough efficiency in pab1Δ cells as opposed to WT ( Fig 8B ) or eRF1 mutant cells ( i. e. , 3'-UTR length should have still been predictive of readthrough efficiency if increased readthrough was a consequence of release factor depletion alone ) , and ii ) deletion of Pab1 's eRF3 interacting domain only ( pab1ΔC ) , which affects termination but not mRNA decay , yields significant stop codon readthrough of reporter mRNAs . Even when we focused our analyses on mRNAs that did have significant changes in TE , where their drastic changes may be due to specific factors outside of the global regulators of translation initiation , their properties are still related to eIF4G-dependent pre-initiation complex recruitment , eIF1-mediated start codon recognition , and efficiency of ribosome recycling ( Figs 5-7 ) . It is also possible that the role of Pab1 in initiation is masked by the strain background used in our study , where yeast cells may have already altered their gene expression profiles to compensate for the lack of Pab1 over extended period of time upon full gene deletion and reached a steady state , because more widespread TE changes ( ~2 . The increased stop codon readthrough observed in pab1Δ cells is unlikely to be due to the release factor level becoming limited , since reduced initiation factors and ribosomal proteins are more limiting than release factors , skewing the usual stoichiometry of demand vs. supply for release factors towards the supply , but this observation is likely due to a shift in stoichiometry of eRF1/eRF3 vs. aa-tRNA/eEF1A towards aa-tRNA/eEF1A , promoting readthrough . We showed that the sets of mRNA substrates of Pat1/Lsm1-mediated decay and NMD both manifest relative increases in abundance and thus likely to be partially stabilized in pab1Δ cells despite their different decay mechanisms , while substrates of Dhh1-mediated decay did not have a tendency to increase or decrease ( Fig 3 ) . First , we noticed that the amount of footprints in the 3'-UTR from pbp1Δ cells is only relatively higher than WT in the first few codons after the stop codon , and from only one of the three biological replicates , compared to pab1Δpbp1Δ cells in which the higher amount of footprints sustains throughout the 80-nt window ( Fig 4A ) . Collectively , our observations of the pleiotropic effects of PAB1 deletion may help explain the discrepancies in previous studies of PABPC 's functions and our multi-omics data can be helpful resources for the design of future experiments involving genetic manipulation , depletion , or overexpression of PABPC . The significant reduction in ribosomal proteins suggests that global translation rates would decrease , yet we find TE of most mRNAs to be unchanged ( Fig 5A ) , indicating that global mRNA levels are also decreased as a consequence of PAB1 deletion . Since PAB1 deletion also reduced eIF4G mRNA and protein levels ( Fig 2A ) , it is possible that effects attributed to the absence of Pab1 are at least partially due to dysregulation of eIF4G mRNA stability and the consequent reduction of eIF4G , which in turn reduced global translation initiation . This sequence of events is also likely for ribosomal proteins , as PABPC depletion has been shown to cause accelerated decay of mRNAs with short poly ( A ) tails , which usually are characteristics of highly expressed , highly translated mRNAs , including those encoding ribosomal proteins . The consequences of Not4 and Not5 depletion may also apply to some Dhh1 substrates ( i. e. , those that are increased ) but not all , possibly due to Dhh1 's involvement in multiple decapping

[ABSTRACT] We use bifurcation analysis of the complete system as well as the slow-fast method to reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation-a common feature of class I excitable neurons . The identified minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump 's generic contribution to burst dynamics can , therefore , contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and , potentially , inform therapeutic strategies . We suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation , such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na+/K+-ATPase activity . Slow brain rhythms , for example during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization , can be accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration . Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase , bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing the bifurcation structure , spiking is tonic , or cells are silenced via depolarization block . It is based on the interplay of fast-spiking voltage dynamics with a one-dimensional slow dynamics of the extracellular potassium concentration , mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase . They are assumed to arise from network-level mechanisms , involving synaptic interactions and delays , or from intrinsically bursting neurons . Here , we explore an alternative mechanism generically available to all neurons with class I excitability . Such slow brain rhythms typically have a lower frequency than tonic action-potential firing . Neuronal burst generation is commonly attributed to ion channels with slow kinetics .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] It is important to note , firstly , that this bistability is different from the bistability in the fast subsystem that the burst mechanism relies on , and secondly , that the free energy depleted depolarisation block , a property of the whole system , is not the same as the Hopf curve in our fast bifurcation diagram , which also terminates spiking . While other , more complex models , exhibit deterministic bursting too , the mechanism described in this study relies only on a minimal set of physiological assumptions in neurons and its dynamics agree with experimental observations in pathological states like epilepsy or spreading depolarization . Kager and colleagues indicated that [ K+ ] out or voltage-dependent ion channels that elicit inward currents can generate seizure-like rhythmic activity , provided that the inward current secondarily triggers the release of K+ into a confined extracellular space-a set of conditions met by the Na+/K+-ATPase . Note that in the bistable region between the HOM and SN bifurcations , the presence of noise in the system or its input can result in stochastic bursting that emerges from switching between the stable limit cycle attractor and the fixed-point dynamics ( see , for example ) . Depending on Na+/K+-ATPase density and input strength , the complete concentration-dependent system exhibits four different regimes : rest , tonic spiking , bursting , and depolarisation block , which have been associated with a range of healthy and/or pathological states . Our model , in alignment with these experimental findings , indicates that-although an insufficient pump current can trigger seizures ( i. e. , bursting ) -a too strong reduction in pump activity can again terminate bursting ( and thus potentially seizures ) because the pump 's activity positively correlates with oxygen levels . Further , the loss-of-function mutation that causes chorea-acanthocytosis is accompanied by an impaired capacity of the Na+/K+-ATPase in neurons , and epilepsy is among the symptoms of this neurodegenerative disorder , potentially fostered by the bursting mechanism at hand . They further showed that adding another ionic regulatory mechanism , such as a bath or glia , to the model can restore the system from depolarization block back to physiological conditions after a significant phase space excursion in ionic variables . Along these lines , it has been argued that if most of the potassium secreted by neurons was siphoned off by astrocytes , neuronal activity could not continue for tens of seconds because of imbalances in potassium concentration . Even partial inactivation of the Na+/K+-ATPase with ouabain has been shown to cause SD-like depolarization : An epileptic population spike is followed by an ouabain-induced SD , which is consistent with the cellular dynamics observed in the model presented here . The present biophysical model also demonstrates the ability to exhibit both bursting and depolarization block , which aligns with previous observations indicating that seizures and spreading depolarizations ( SD ) can originate from the same neuronal population . Due to the universality of the identified mechanism , which applies to any neuron with class I excitability , our results demonstrate the sufficiency of the Na+/K+-ATPase for the generation of slow rhythmic bursting across a large set of neuronal cell types . In summary , we present a minimal mechanism for deterministic bursting activity that arises from the interplay of very common spiking dynamics with changes in the extracellular potassium concentration mediated by a ubiquitous Na+/K+-ATPase . While previous studies assigned a mechanistic role to the Na+/K+-ATPase for rhythmic bursting in pattern generators , it was the interaction between h-currents and the pump for control of Na+ that was emphasized ; the burst mechanism proposed in this paper was not investigated . Through complete system bifurcation analysis , they revealed

[ABSTRACT] Therefore , it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria , from cluster stability to prognostic relevance , and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets . Affinity Network Fusion , Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization , and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies . Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types , including breast , prostate , and lung , utilizing mRNA , CNV , miRNA , and DNA methylation data . Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like clustering stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance . Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score , survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates , and the stability of the results . Unlike previous studies , our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness . Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation , we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study . Furthermore , current frameworks do not allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering , highlighting a significant gap in the methodology . COPS features advanced methods , including similarity networks , kernel-based approaches , dimensionality reduction , and pathway knowledge integration . We present the COPS R-package , tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results . Some of these methods are not accessible through R , and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS . While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics , they vary considerably across methods and datasets .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We focused on kernel-based knowledge driven clustering methods due to their performance advantage in analyzing high-dimensional data and the ability to separate the kernel from the algorithm which enabled us to compare the same clustering algorithm between data- and knowledge-driven kernels and to use PIK which was originally developed for a supervised learning task . The stability analysis highlighted that many algorithms , such as ANF , IntNMF , and MKKM-MR with linear kernels , BWK , or PIK , were effective in identifying stable clusters while iCluster+ , MOFA2 , and MKKM-MR with RWR-BWK or PAMOGK were less stable , which suggests an elevated sensitivity to sampling variability . For this reason , we selected a cancer-associated subset of 48 KEGG pathways for the main figures , but also tested the NCI-PID pathways of which 210 included overlapping genes with the TCGA datasets ( See S4 , S5 , and S7 Figs ) . Out of the pathway based methods BWK and PIK seemed most promising , however , it should be noted that combining these methods with different pathway interaction databases such as Reactome or the National Cancer Institute Pathway interaction database , could yield different results . As the full interplay between different omics in the pathogenesis of cancer is still not fully understood , it would be unreasonable to assume that current subtypes represent the expected clustering result of a perfect algorithm . Selecting a limited set of key pathways specific to the disease is recommended since each pathway-omic combination is represented by a different kernel and a large number of noisy kernels can overwhelm the integration algorithm . Therefore , it is crucial to test different clustering methods and evaluate a variety of criteria , including survival relevance and clustering stability to select the most appropriate solution for the specific research question and dataset at hand . While it is important to assess whether the subtypes identified by clustering methods are associated with established cancer subtypes , this evaluation should not necessarily guide the selection of the overall best method . In our study , we employed COPS for multi-omics clustering on seven cancer types , including breast , prostate , and lung , among others , using mRNA , CNV , miRNA , and DNA methylation data . Clustering outcomes were evaluated based on three key metrics : the ARI score , survival analysis conducted through Cox regression models accounting for relevant covariates , and the stability of the clustering results . These results were aligned with our observations of the best methods in the KEGG results suggesting that the PID networks were not too noisy or numerous although the required computational resources were higher . Unlike prior studies , we compared data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods , while also incorporating subsampling to ensure robust assessment of results and metrics . Subsequently , Pareto efficiency was analyzed to determine the balance of evaluation metrics and to identify superior algorithms based on their proficiency in recognizing solutions on the initial Pareto frontier . Furthermore , other methods , such as BWK MKKM-MR , yielded relevant results in specific datasets by providing unique trade-offs between stability and survival . Moreover , the results with highest survival differences were attained with a number of clusters much higher than the number of histological subtypes which highlights the need for further subdivision . The PID results for RWR-BWK and PAMOGK showed higher stability at the expense of survival significance while BWK and PIK achieved slightly higher survival significance in RCC and PRAD respectively .

[ABSTRACT] Furthermore , our work identified new interactions in the gene regulatory network ( GRN ) underlying C. elegans postembryonic development and adds to the general understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins . We have identified a novel partial loss-of-function sem-2 allele that has a proline to serine change in the C-terminal tail of the highly conserved DNA-binding domain . Finally , SEM-2 appears to directly regulate the expression of hlh-8 , which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor and plays critical roles in proper patterning of the M lineage . First , SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381 , the sole C. elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor , to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage . One set of highly conserved transcription factors that plays diverse roles in development is the SoxC group . Our data , along with previous studies , suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins . SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development , and for specifying the sex myoblast ( SM ) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm , the M lineage . Detailed analyses of mutant animals harboring this point mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage . Second , in addition to specifying the SM fate , SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage . Development of multicellular organisms requires well-orchestrated interplay between cell-intrinsic transcription factors and cell-cell signaling . C. elegans contains a sole SoxC protein , SEM-2 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The more prevalent expression of the vm1-specific reporter ( egl-15p : :rfp ) in sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants is similar to our previous report showing that in lin-39 ( 0 ) mab-5 ( 0 ) mutants where the M lineage exhibits reduced cell proliferation , the few M lineage cells precociously differentiate to express the vm1 marker egl-15p : :gfp , but not vm2 or um markers . We have shown that while the vm1-specific reporter ( egl-15p : :rfp ) is expressed in over 90 % of sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants , a significantly smaller fraction of sem-2 ( P158S ) mutant animals express the vm2-specific reporter ( hlh-29p : :gfp , 28 % ) , the um-specific marker ( rgs-2p : :gfp , 50 % ) , or another vm marker ( arg-1p : :gfp , 1 . Based on this model , in wild-type animals , SMA-9 functions , either acting through or independently of LET-381 , to repress sem-2 expression in the presumptive CC mothers ( M. dlp and M. drp ) and CCs ( M. dlpa and M. drpa ) in the dorsal M lineage ( Fig 11A ) . In sem-2 ( P158S ) ; sma-9 ( 0 ) double mutants , the partially functional SEM-2 ( P158S ) protein being expressed in the dorsal side of the M lineage is not sufficient to fully repress let-381 expression , leading to the expression of let-381 and the formation of M-CCs in a fraction of these double mutant animals ( Fig 11D ) . It is possible that SEM-2 functions upstream of , and/or works cooperatively with , certain cell cycle regulators , either through positive regulation of G1/S-phase cyclins ( Cyclin D/CDK4 , Cyclin E/CDK2 ) or negative regulation of CDK inhibitors like CKIs ( CKI-1/CKI-2 ) [ 46-51 ] . In this study , we have found that the sem-2 ( P158S ) mutation , which renders the SEM-2 protein partially functional , can suppress the loss of M-CC phenotype of sma-9 ( 0 ) mutants ( Susm ) , and that this Susm phenotype is dependent on the presence of LET-381 ( Tables 1 and 3 , Fig 4 ) . Similarly , expression of sem-2 in the SM mother cells and the SMs requires LIN-12/Notch signaling and the zinc finger transcription factor SEM-4 , implicating additional levels of complexity in the regulatory network underlying proper fate specification in the M lineage . Similarly , SoxC proteins are known to function upstream of Twist1 , in some cases directly , in disease initiation and progression in mammals , particularly in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) [ 16 , 56-58 ] . egl-15 and arg-1 are direct targets of HLH-8 , and they have each been shown to be expressed in and/or to work in patterning a subset of mesodermal tissues : the egg-laying muscles and the enteric muscles . Finally , sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants exhibit reduced , yet differential , expression of several HLH-8 target genes , such as egl-15p : :gfp and arg-1p : :gfp , a phenotype that has been previously observed in various hlh-8 mutants . We have shown that E1 , a 20bp region containing Site1 , is essential for hlh-8 promoter activity in transgenic reporter assays , and Site1 is important for hlh-8 expression in the endogenous genomic environment ( Figs 9 and 10 ) . In sma-9 ( 0 ) single mutants , ectopic expression of a fully functional sem-2 in the dorsal M lineage leads to the repression of let-381 expression in the presumptive CCs , causing the transformation of these cells to SMs ( Fig 11B ) . Sox4 , one of the SoxC proteins in humans , is often amplified and overexpressed
