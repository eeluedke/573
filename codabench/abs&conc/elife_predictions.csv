[ABSTRACT] Thus , our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one , but multiple gap junctions , in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions . We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells , at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse . The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses . Remarkably , most of the synaptic contact 's surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions , suggesting a close functional association between these two structures . In contrast , glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact , indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse . Electrical synapses are , on the other hand , generally defined by the presence of a 'gap junction ' ( a cluster of intercellular channels ) between two neuronal processes . Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures . However , while gap junctions provide the communicating mechanism , it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures . Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell-cell communication , known as 'chemical ' and 'electrical ' synapses , respectively . Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components . Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The 4× diameter increase after expansion represented a 13× increase of the oval contact areas and did not alter the morphology of the terminals , as supported by ( 1 ) expansion reproduced the characteristic concavity of the CE synaptic contact area with the M-cell ; ( 2 ) the spatial distribution of chemical vs. electrical synaptic areas was consistent with that observed by electron microscopy in adult goldfish and unexpanded zebrafish terminals Lasseigne et al. , 2021 ; ( 3 ) labeled puncta contain all the molecular components known to form GJs at CEs ; ( 4 ) morphometric analysis indicated that the expansion process had no selective effects across the CE population ; and ( 5 ) finally , consistent with this analysis , tissue expansion was tridimensional and exposed the expected pre- vs. postsynaptic localization of proteins at single punctum representing individual GJs . As in CEs , multiple Cx36-labeled puncta engulfed by N-cadherin labeling were also observed at cell-cell contacts between the somata of neurons of the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminus in mice , indicating that this arrangement is not a unique feature of fish mixed synapses but might also apply to electrical synapses elsewhere . While it was generally accepted that GJs form via lateral diffusion of hemichannels following microtubule-mediated delivery to the plasma membrane , more recent evidence obtained in cell expression systems shows that microtubules actually tether to the AJ , facilitating delivery of vesicles containing connexin hemichannels directly to the cell-cell border of the GJ . Since interactions between GJs and AJs involving cadherins are thought to be relevant for the insertion of new GJ channels , this process might be intimately related to the maintenance and plasticity of GJ communication via regulated turnover of these channels at CEs , which are formed by fish homologs of Cx36 . Finally , although N-cadherin was also shown to be involved in regulating chemical synapses , the distribution of chemical synapses to small peripheral areas of the CE contact indicates a primary functional role of this molecule at electrical synapses as both GJ proteins and N-cadherin are similarly distributed throughout the entire synaptic contact area . In summary , as single synaptic contact , expansion microscopy of CEs offered the possibility of identifying the structures that support electrical transmission and , therefore , the components that together form an electrical synapse , which can be used to define electrical synapses throughout animal connectomes . Like chemical synapses that operate with dramatically different numbers of releases sites , ranging from a single one at synaptic terminals of PHP cells on the M-cell to up to 700 in the Calyx of Held , electrical synapses could function with different number of GJs . While the sentence `` The map is not the territory '' was coined by Alfred Korzybski to metaphorically illustrate the distinction between brain perception and reality Korzybski , 1933 , it applies to the properties of maps in general and to the usefulness of applying expansion microscopy to expose the synaptic map of CE contacts . As a representation of reality , the labeling of molecules forming GJs , glutamate receptors , and AJs allowed us to expose the incidence and spatial distribution of the various synaptic components with enough accuracy to provide an 'analogous structure ' of the contact 's structural organization . While it is currently unknown how regulation of the overall conductance of the CE electrical synapse is achieved , it must necessarily result from the coordinated contribution of its multiple GJs , suggesting the need of additional synaptic structures capable of coordinating the function of the numerous GJs . That
[METHODS] ",,935,95,None,"The nervous system is made up of neurons that communicate with each other via a network of connections called synapses . These connectomes are formed by a cluster of intercellular channels called gap junctions , which are known to be involved in the transmission of electrical signals between neurons . However , it is not clear how these channels form , or how they are regulated , in the nervous system . To answer this question , Lasseigne et al . used zebrafish cells to study the structure of a synapse . The experiments showed that a single contact between a cell and a neuron is formed by two different structures . One of these structures is called a “gap junction” , and the other is known as an adherens junction . In the zebbiosis , the gap junction is found in the brain of the frog Mauthner cells , where it forms a contact with a nerve cell . This contact is also known as a synaptic contact , but it is unclear whether the gap Junction is a part of the communication network . Using a technique called electron microscopy , Matsumoto , Yin ed . found that the contact between the cell and the neuron was formed by multiple gaps , including one that is known to form a gap junction , while the other was not . Thus , this study reveals that , unlike other types of communication , electrical signals are transmitted between the cells ."

[ABSTRACT] We show that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons , based on their axonal projections , is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors . To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons , we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity , with minimal effects on breathing . The pre-Bötzinger complex ( preBötC ) , a key primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm , contains neurons that project directly to facial nucleus ( 7n ) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity . The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity . This is of fundamental importance , given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases . These effects are altered by the type of anesthetic employed and also between anesthetized and conscious states .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Although we have contemplated directing the optical fibers to the facial nucleus to evaluate this , we are cautious about using GtACR2 to inhibit axonal terminals , given the evidence of increased synaptic activity and neurotransmitter release in response to light-induced activation of GtACR2 at the axon terminal . It is possible that the strict synchronization between premotor and motor neurons is not confined to respiratory motor activity , but is crucial for the coordination of respiratory , cardiovascular , and orofacial/nasofacial activity necessary for the execution of complex behaviors , such as exercise , response to stress , or pain . Interestingly , in addition to regulating expiratory activity , it has been shown that the lateral parafacial nucleus may also play a role in coordinating nasofacial and orofacial behavior during high chemical drive via direct projections to 7n . In this way , methodologies that only affect inputs from preBötC to C1 neurons , such as the approach used in the present study , could shine the light on the mechanisms involved in the development of hypertension and possibly contribute to the development of targeted therapeutics used to prevent hypertension development . While our data are not sufficient to adequately address this question , our working hypothesis is that the facial nucleus projecting preBötC neurons are transmitting respiratory rhythm , rather than being responsible for generating it . For example , we speculate that under urethane anesthesia , when mystacial pad EMG is active , glutamatergic preBötC→7n neurons play a major role in regulating the respiration-related mystacial pad activity and their photoinhibition resulted in a decrease in activity . Thus , indirect projections from preBötC to 7n via lateral parafacial nucleus may also be involved with the responses on the mystacial pad activity induced by the non-selective inhibition of preBötC . Interestingly , independent of the BP level , BP variability seems to be an important contributor to organ damage , such as renal dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy , cardiovascular disease , and poor clinical outcomes . While there was a clear difference in the effect of selective preBötC→7n photoinhibition on breathing , compared to non-selective preBötC photoinhibition , selective photoinhibition did have small effects on breathing , particularly under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia and its recovery phases . While the functional role of many of these collateral projections has not been established yet , we hypothesize that the small effect of selective photoinhibition reflects their ongoing , functionally relevant activity . We tested the hypothesis that the preBötC might consist of separate subpopulations of neurons that project to specific nuclei to coordinate respiratory rhythmicity with different physiological behaviors , such as nasofacial activity . Our previous studies suggest that respiratory input from preBötC to the catecholaminergic C1 neurons of RVLM may be involved with the increased inspiratory-sympathetic modulation in hypertensive rats . However , the widespread collateralization we observed along with effects of photoinhibition of the preBötC→7n on disparate motor activities raises the possibility that preBötC neurons may coordinate multiple outputs . The preBötC , initially defined as the kernel for generating inspiratory rhythm , appears to act as a master oscillator regulating other physiological functions , such as orofacial behaviors and autonomic nervous activity . On the other hand , feedforward inhibition via collateral projections from inhibitory preBötC into these same regions may contribute to the dynamic shaping of the respiratory pattern . Collateral projections from excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons to premotor and motoneurons have been described before and appear to be essential for the coordination of inspiratory and expiratory activity . Beyond affecting inspiratory and MP activity , non-selective inhibition of preBötC also increased and produced tonic activity of the abdominal muscle that lasted for the apnea duration . As has been described previously using transgenic mice , we also observed that different subpopulations of preBötC→7n express either markers of an excitatory phenotype or an inhibitory phenotype . We observed that the transduced axons of preBötC→7n neurons projected widely into
[METHODS] ",,880,92,None,"Inhalation is the process of breathing , and it is regulated by a complex network of neurons called the pre-Bötzinger complex . The preBöTzinger Complex is made up of neurons that project directly to the facial nucleus ( 7n ) motoneurons , which are involved in the coordination of breathing and other physiological behaviors . These neurons are known to be involved in a number of different processes , including breathing and heart rhythms . However , it is not clear how these neurons work together , or how they interact with each other . To investigate this question , Xu et al . used a technique called optogenetics to study the activity of a group of neurons in the facial neuron , called preBotzingers Complex . This technique allowed the researchers to use a combination of different techniques to study how the preBótzingr Complex works . Using the technique , the researchers were able to show that a small number of preBtzingler complex neurons , known as motoneurons , were active during breathing . In contrast , in the case of nasopharyngeal hypertension , these neurons were active in the face , but not in the nose . While the results of the experiments showed that motonic neurons are active in both the nose and nose , their activity was not affected by the type of anesthesia used . Instead , they were activated by light , suggesting that these neurons may be active in different parts of the brain . For example , when a person is unconscious , his or her nose is more active ."

[ABSTRACT] These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system , capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception , and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger . Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests , presumably by amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous . If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm , their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat . Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain . However , most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses , with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors . In contrast , animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses , even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning . To address this , we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice . Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The expression of defensive behaviors varied depending on the type of US : under robot chasing conditions , increased CGRP activity made the robot seem as if it were moving faster , driving the animals to flee more during both conditioning and the retention test . Overall , our findings indicate that CGRP neurons act as a general alarm system , primarily orchestrating freezing responses but also contributing to active defensive behaviors by intensifying the perception of heightened threats , ensuring responses are adapted to the level of danger . These findings suggest that CGRP neurons detect and process threats , predominantly driving freezing behavior , while also enabling active responses under heightened danger to facilitate appropriate defensive behaviors aligned with the intensity of the threat . Although fear learning can occur through various pathways , our use of optogenetics and TetTox suggested that CGRP neurons contribute to both active and passive defensive behaviors , facilitating responses that are appropriate to the magnitude of the threat . Our results showed that a robot speed of 70 cm/s did not induce fleeing response during the retention test ( Figures 3F and 5E ) ; however , increasing the robot 's speed to 90 cm/s elicited conditioned flight responses in control mice . However , most research on CGRP has utilized footshock or other aversive stimuli in small arenas , potentially limiting the observation of fleeing responses and leading to a focus on passive freezing as the predominant behavior studied . Using a naturalistic paradigm with a robot and other aversive stimuli of varying threat levels , we recorded neuronal activity and found that CGRP neurons encode different threat intensities through variations in firing duration and amplitude . Optogenetic stimulation of CGRP neurons in the absence of external stimuli induced robust freezing , and their activation during conventional fear conditioning further amplified conditioned freezing , demonstrating their primary role in driving passive defensive responses . For instance , different populations of CGRP neurons in the parvocellular subparafascicular nucleus of the thalamus also respond to threats and relay negative emotional signals to the amygdala thereby contributing to aversive memory formation . While effective for observing transitions between freezing and fleeing , our electrophysiological data show that CGRP neurons are more excited in response to the US compared to the CS ( Figure 1F and G ) . Additionally , this paradigm allowed for the observation of two distinct defensive responses to the CS : passive freezing and active fleeing , providing a platform to explore defensive behaviors across varying threat contexts . However , the reduced fear responses were not sustained on the retention test day , suggesting that transient inhibition during the chasing was insufficient to suppress the acquisition of fear memory ( Figure 3E ) . However , the progressive increase in freezing levels across trials during conditioning , even with CGRP neurons silenced ( Figure 6B ) , suggests the involvement of other pathways in processing the aversive stimuli . By incorporating the predator-like robot , we developed a behavioral paradigm that enabled animals to form fear memory while minimizing differences in bumping incidents between groups . One such example is changing the CS to a serial-compound stimulus , where a pure tone is immediately followed by a white noise , inducing freezing and flight responses , respectively . However , under heightened threat conditions , such as enhanced CGRP activation or faster robot speeds , these neurons also strengthened active defensive behaviors by amplifying perceived threat . Additionally , the midbrain periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) transmits aversive signals to the amygdala and other forebrain structures , ensuring effective expression of defensive responses upon the detection of a threat . Optogenetic activation of these neurons during fear conditioning amplified the perceived threat posed by the US , making it seem more dangerous , while

[ABSTRACT] Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ∼30 , 000 UK Biobank participants , we test the hypothesis that obesity ( waist-to-hip ratio , WHR ) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics : isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ) , an index of free water , and intra-cellular volume fraction ( ICVF ) , an index of neurite density . These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity , whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation . To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein ( CRP ) , we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF ( rg = 0 . The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions , decreased glial density , and high mu opioid ( MOR ) and other neurotransmitter receptor density . We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems : a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF . Conversely , the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors . 112 , P < 9×10−4 ) as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF ( P < 0 . The relationship between obesity and human brain structure is incompletely understood . 36 ) and ICVF ( rg = 0 . 026 , P = 0 . 05 ) .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] By relating obesity associated grey matter microstructure maps to gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas , we show that regions where WHR was more tightly linked to tissue water content had greater expression of pattern recognition receptors ( PRR ) and receptors for binding fatty acid derivatives , and reduced expression of genes associated with biological processes linked to interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) responses . Interestingly , this system was not co-located with any specific cell class but it was co-located with specific neurotransmitter receptor maps including H3 , Mu , CB1 , and A4B2 , meaning that regions showing the greatest positive scaling between neurite density and WHR showed relatively low expression of receptors linked to feeding , appetite , and energy expenditure . Here , using NODDI modelling of diffusion-weighted MRI data from ∼30 , 000 participants in the UK Biobank we have extended these findings to demonstrate associations between obesity ( WHR ) and two measures of grey matter microstucture , ISOVF ( an index of tissue water content ) and ICVF an index of neurite density ( see Table 1 for a summary ) . This pattern of results is consistent with the model that changes in neurite density associated with obesity might reflect primary brain changes in taste sensation and reward processing that drive consummatory behaviours leading to obesity ; whereas changes in brain free water associated with obesity might reflect effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by adipose tissue that drive extravasation and oedema in some brain regions . Future studies will hopefully provide a more comprehensive picture of whole brain gene expression as a function of age so that the powerful strategy for linking transcriptional and imaging data that the AHBA dataset has enabled can be extended to gene expression datasets more closely aligned demographically with the neuroimaging dataset of interest . Concerning the question whether both brain systems are in operation in the same individual at the same time , we are not aware of any currently available tools that would allow us to actually test this assumption , but it could be an interesting avenue for future work . In contrast , the medial temporal-occipital-striatal system where obesity was associated with increased neurite density was co-located with expression of transcripts positively enriched for taste receptor activity and lower fatty acid binding , glutamate receptor activity and other biological processes linked to protein kinase C-activating G-protein-coupled receptor signalling . Using novel techniques for analysis of spatial co-location of whole genome transcript maps and MRI phenotypes to optimise subsequent enrichment analysis of strongly co-located gene transcripts , we found that transcripts co-located with ISOVF~WHR were enriched for IL6 and pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) , both implicated in innate immune signalling ; whereas transcripts co-located with ICVF~WHR were enriched for taste receptors . Interestingly , these regions were also richer in astrocytes , microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells but not any class of neurons ; and had high concentrations of some but not all neurotransmitter receptors or transporters tested , for example , histamine ( H3 ) , mu-opioid , D1 , and 5HTT . One limitation of this study is that data was collected at multiple centres and even though we used site as a nuisance regressor there might be unaccounted for non-linear effects . Obesity in turn causes a pro-inflammatory state systemically and blood concentrations of CRP , IL-6 and other cytokines have previously been associated with changed ( increased ) micro-structural MRI metrics of free water . Another limitation of our study is that it is based on a cross-sectional dataset , and it is therefore impossible to disentangle causally directed relationships

The brain also has fewer neurons , and this can lead to a decrease in the number of neurons in the brain . However , it is not clear how the brains of people with obesity are related to each other .

Using the technique , we found that the two brain systems were associated with different levels of brain water content . In the prefrontal and temporal regions of the brain the density of the neurons was higher , but in the striatal region the density was lower , suggesting that obesity is linked to the activity of the innate immune system . Furthermore , in the medial temporal region , there was a lower density of neurotransmitters called mu opioids . Our results suggest that obesity may be linked to changes in brain water levels , as well as changes in the density and density of neurons based on genetic information ."

[ABSTRACT] Examining disseminating tumour cells in over 12 , 000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours , we see a significant enrichment of EpCAM , CD24 and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens . We have previously identified both EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers that , alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin , identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines . In this study , we have observed single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens , and these are highly predictive of metastatic disease . This afforded the opportunity to investigate whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours . However , tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the tissue surrounding human tumour specimens , leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain . Through training an artificial neural network , these predict metastasis with high accuracy ( cross-validated accuracy of 87-89 % ) . Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental cancer models .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] An important strength of our study has been the ability to look at the single cell level in an automated fashion across thousands of fields of view from human tumours , enabling us to observe and quantify human tumour cells disseminating into the surrounding tissue . We have shown that immunofluorescent antibody co-staining for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 can separate disseminating EMT CSCs from the stromal content of human tumours , a challenge which has confounded previous attempts to develop a predictive EMT signature . This comes at the cost of increased computing requirements and reduced ability to decode the learning process ( the so-called 'black box ' ) , but in our study the image-based approach proved essential to achieve high predictive accuracy . The lack of improvement in predictive accuracy when trained on a collection of 9000 images compared to 3500 suggests a limitation of the ANN , and a possible role for more sophisticated neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) . The role of EMT in tumour dissemination has long been debated but , lacking evidence of cells undergoing EMT whilst disseminating from human tumours in vivo , this role has had to be inferred from mouse models and human cell line models . We also show that EpCAM+Vim+CD24- tumour cells in the stroma do not correlate with metastasis , and therefore the clinically predictive utility of tumour cell staining in the stroma can be isolated specifically to the EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ EMT CSCs . A partial EMT state has previously been identified in an OSCC scRNAseq dataset ; this state retained epithelial gene expression alongside expression of mesenchymal genes , and was correlated with nodal metastasis and adverse pathological features . There is a requirement for CD24 , which we have previously shown to be a plasticity marker within the EMT population even when driven into full morphological EMT under TGFβ treatment . Now , using immunofluorescent staining for EMT CSCs that retain the epithelial marker EpCAM alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin and the CSC plasticity marker CD24 , we have identified single EMT CSCs disseminating into the stroma surrounding oral tumours . Here , through applying our understanding of EMT cancer cell heterogeneity and markers for EMT CSCs , we have identified EMT CSCs disseminating from the primary tumour in human pathological specimens . This may also enable the application of a CNN to the imaging data to see if it can achieve even higher predictive accuracy than that reported here . This highlights the value of using techniques that give single cell resolution , enabling isolation of the signal to the specific cell type of interest within a highly heterogeneous cellular environment . We have also shown that retention of EpCAM is not on its own sufficient alongside Vimentin to mark disseminating EMT CSCs that correlate with metastasis . Using an image-based machine learning approach , we have demonstrated the ability to predict metastasis with high accuracy through staining for EMT CSCs . Image-based machine learning approaches employ a greater range of inputs to develop their predictions , and therefore often achieve greater predictive accuracy than machine learning approaches that use simpler data inputs . This in turn enabled us to identify single disseminating EMT CSCs , and use these to train an ANN to predict metastasis . This suggests that the EMT CSC state may be more complex than a simple coalescence of epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics . To support the conclusions of this study , a further blinded cohort and a greater number of tumour specimens would be valuable . Whereas the ANN is trained using intensity values for each pixel , a CNN uses the raw image for training . CNNs require many more images for training , but can reach higher levels of accuracy . Importantly , the presence of these disseminating stem cells is strongly correlated with tumour metastasis . However , epithelial keratins are not retained .
[METHODS] ",,875,92,None,"Cancer stem cells are a group of cells that are found in the tissue surrounding a tumour . These cells are called cancer stem cells , and they are able to disseminate from the tumour into the surrounding tissue . However , it is not clear whether these cells are involved in the spread of cancer , or if they are part of a larger population of cells . The first step in this process is to identify which cells are present in the tumour and which are not . This process is called epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . EMT is a process in which cells divide and divide . It is also known as metastatic disease , but it has not been shown to be associated with metastatic tumors .

Using a combination of imaging techniques , the ANN trained on 74 human oral tumours , which had been scanned for tumour cells in the laboratory . In the experiments , a protein called EpCAM and a marker called Vimentin were used to identify tumour cells that dissipated from the tumor . A second protein called CD24 was also used to detect cancer cells that were not present in vivo . By using a new technique called CNN , this revealed that tumour cells dissing from the primary tumour were more likely to spread to the stroma surrounding the tumour , rather than the tumour itself . Wang 's findings suggest that the combination of these three markers could be used to predict metastatic cancer . Further experiments will be needed to determine whether the combined markers can be used in the future ."

[ABSTRACT] These data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients . Interestingly , human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6 . Here , we use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a map of the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds . We find that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells , including resident Lyve1+ macrophages , during inflammation . During early inflammation in mouse wounds , we detect upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms . However , the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood . Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis . Apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that drive tissue repair . By contrast , inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor , Timd4 , in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] These data resonate with recent data suggesting that fibroblasts can engulf apoptotic endothelial cells to alter their contractility , migration , and ECM production , and may indicate a direct role for fibroblasts in modulating the inflammatory milieu of early wounds through detection of apoptotic cells . Here , we show that in early murine skin wounds , Axl inhibition did not impact efferocytosis in a detectable manner , but rather Axl expression shifted from dendritic cells to macrophages , suggesting possible compensatory mechanisms via other efferocytosis receptors . We found that apoptotic genes were upregulated in most of the cell types present in early wounds , which likely allows the dynamic shifts in transcriptional profiles of inflammatory cells we observed in the first few days of tissue repair . Given the importance of apoptosis in wound repair and the expression of distinct apoptotic receptors in different cells , skin wound healing is an excellent model to decipher the mechanisms by which distinct cells recognize and respond to interactions with apoptotic cells . We also found that mRNAs encoding efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways are upregulated in the early skin wound beds and in diabetic foot wounds , and confirmed protein upregulation of the efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in murine wounds . Our data suggest that in skin wounds , apoptotic cells are rapidly detected and removed via efferocytosis , which is consistent with the large number of phagocytic neutrophils and macrophages in early wounds . Interestingly , efferocytosis receptors were upregulated in professional phagocytes as well as in fibroblasts , which also increased expression of a large number of efferocytosis ligands in both mouse wounds and diabetic foot ulcers ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Given further research into the healing phenotypes of efferocytosis-inhibited wounds , it may be that targeting these mechanisms may reveal therapeutic avenues that promote healing in chronic , non-healing wounds , particularly in diabetic patients . Furthermore , Axl null bone marrow-derived macrophages are unable to perform efferocytosis with TLR3 activation in vitro , which suggests that Axl plays a central role in efferocytosis in inflammatory environments . Furthermore , we did not detect differences in Axl expression in TLR3 null and control wounds , further suggesting the inflammatory wound environment in vivo displays activation of Axl receptor expression independent of TLR3 . Our future studies will test the role of Timd4 on DCs and resident macrophages , T cell immunity , and how they impact wound repair phenotypes noted with Timd4 inhibition . Detection of apoptotic cells has also been linked to inflammation and context-dependent integration of IL-4 signaling to activate an anti-inflammatory and tissue repair gene program . We find that early murine wound beds and human diabetic foot wounds significantly upregulate apoptotic genes and receptors that recognize apoptotic cells and that inhibition of multiple apoptotic receptors impairs wound repair . Using functional inhibition studies in mouse wounds , our data show that efferocytosis receptors , Axl and Timd4 , have differential effects on efferocytosis and wound repair . Axl may function in skin wounds by interacting with other tyrosine kinase receptors , which has been shown for EGFR , MET , and PDGFR . Future work exploring Axl 's function in a cell type-dependent manner , including possibly directly activating angiogenesis in skin wounds , will decipher these possibilities . Here , we provide an atlas for the dynamic changes that occur in the early inflammatory stage of wound repair in the skin at the single-cell level . Mechanistically , apoptotic cells can release signaling factors including Wnts and PGE2 to promote proliferation of tissue resident cells and tissue repair in multiple species . We found that apoptotic and efferocytosis pathways were upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse wounds and in diabetic foot wounds of human patients . In the heart , Lyve1+ resident macrophages act in a cardioprotective manner during myocardial infarction and are immunoregulatory and promote engraftment
[METHODS] ",,888,93,None,"When a wound is inflamed , it can lead to the formation of a blood vessel that can help heal the wound . However , the mechanisms by which this process is carried out are not fully understood . In the early stages of the healing process , cells called apoptotic cells are detected and removed by the immune system . This process is known as efferocytosis , and it is thought that this process has evolved over time . It is thought to be important for the healing of wounds in diabetic patients , but it is not clear how this process works in the human body . To address this question , Xu et al . have used a technique called RNA sequencing to study the cellular dynamics of the skin wounds of mice . The experiments show that a cell called Axl , which is found in the skin of diabetic foot ulcers , detects and removes a large number of cells in the wounds . These cells are called dendritic cells and fibroblasts and are involved in the repair process . Interestingly , in the mouse wounds that were treated with a drug that inhibits Axal , these cells were more likely to be infected . Furthermore , they were also found to be upregulated in other cells , such as macrophages and phagocytic cells . As a result , this suggests that the apocalypse of the cells is a process that is important for wound healing . Further research is needed to understand how the cells that recognize and remove the cells are activated in the first few days of the wound healing process and how they respond to these signals ."

[ABSTRACT] This method , called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ) , involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing , labeling a cell population of interest . By creating many such independently barcoded fly strains , TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects , identification of multiplet droplets , and barcoding of experimental timepoints , conditions , and replicates . Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided novel insights into the dynamics of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues and have enabled the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases . Thus , TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments . However , linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge . Furthermore , we demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements . We describe a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools in Drosophila to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While the utility of TaG-EM barcode-based quantification will vary based on the number of conditions being analyzed and the ease of quantifying the behavior or phenotype by other means , we demonstrate that TaG-EM can be employed to cost-effectively streamline labor-intensive assays and to quantify phenotypes with small effect sizes ( Figure 4 , Figure 4-figure supplement 2 ) . However , one distinction between the two approaches is that RABID-Seq relies on stochastic viral infection of mammalian cells while TaG-EM allows reproducible targeting of defined cell populations allowing unambiguous cell identification and potentially allowing the same cell populations to be assessed at different timepoints or in the context of different experimental manipulations . We excluded this poor performing barcode line from the fecundity tests ; however , backcrossing is often used to bring reagents into a consistent genetic background for behavioral experiments and could also potentially be used to address behavior-specific issues with specific TaG-EM lines . In summary , combined with the large collections of Gal4 and split-Gal4 lines that have been established in Drosophila that enable precise targeting of a high proportion of cell types , TaG-EM provides a means to target and label cells in vivo for subsequent detection in single-cell sequencing . In addition , while the original TaG-EM lines were made using a membrane-localized myr : :GFP construct , variants that express GFP in other cell compartments such as the cytoplasm or nucleus could be constructed to enable increased expression levels or purification of nuclei . Currently , up to 176 conditions can be multiplexed in a single pooled experiment with existing TaG-EM lines , but because sequencing indices can be added after amplification in a separate indexing PCR step , many hundreds or even thousands of such experiments can be multiplexed in a single-sequencing run . Our experiments indicated that for the specific drivers we tested TaG-EM barcodes are detected in around one quarter of the cells if relying on endogenous expression in the gene expression library , though this fraction was higher ( ~37 % ) if sequencing an enriched TaG-EM barcode library in parallel ( Figure 6 , Figure 6-figure supplement 8 and Figure 6-figure supplement 9 ) . Sequencing-based TaG-EM measurements recapitulated more laborious , one-at-a-time measurements in a phototaxis assay , an age-dependent fecundity assay , and a gut motility assay , demonstrating that TaG-EM can be used to measure behavior or other phenotypes in multiplexed , pooled populations ( Figures 3-4 ) . Analysis of structured pools of flies with defined inputs suggests that TaG-EM barcode measurements are highly accurate and reproducible , particularly in cases where multiple barcodes are used to label an experimental condition and averaged ( Figure 2 ) . For single-cell RNA-Seq experiments , the cost savings of multiplexing is roughly the cost of a run divided by the number of independent lines multiplexed , plus labor savings by also being able to multiplex upstream flow cytometry , minus loss of unbarcoded cells . Advances in next-generation sequencing , as well as single-cell and spatial genomics are enabling new types of detailed analyses to study important biological processes such as development and nervous system function . In addition , we show that TaG-EM barcodes can be expressed by tissue-specific Gal4 drivers and used to tag specific cell populations upstream of single-cell sequencing ( Figures 5-6 ) . However , we also observed variable recovery of TaG-EM barcodes that were all driven by the same pan-midgut Gal4 driver ( Figure 6-figure supplement 10 ) . Recently , a conceptually similar approach called RABID-Seq has been described , which allows trans-synaptic labeling of neural circuits using barcoded viral transcripts . Nuclear labeling could also be achieved by co-expressing a nuclear GFP construct with existing TaG-EM lines in analogy to the use of hexameric GFP described above . We did note that one line ( TaG-EM barcode 14 )
[METHODS] ",,899,93,None,"In the fruit fly Drosophila , the genome is encoded by a set of genes . The genes that are expressed in the cells of the fly are known as gene expression genes , and the genes that make up these genes are known to be expressed in different types of cells . However , it is not clear how the genes are expressed , or how they are expressed by the cells , in the fly . To investigate this , researchers have developed a method called targeted genetically-encoded multiplexing ( TaG-EM ) , which uses a DNA barcode to insert into the DNA of a cell . This allows the DNA to be read out during single-cell sequencing , allowing the data to be analyzed in a way that can be used to identify the cells that are most likely to be active . In addition , this method can also be used for other experiments , such as fecundity tests , to measure the number of cells in the population . For example , TaG–EM can be applied to a variety of conditions , including a phototaxis assay , an age-dependent phenotype assay and a gut motility test . Currently , only a small fraction of the cells are active , but this could be reduced by using next-generation sequencing . Now , Wang et al . have created a new method that uses the same DNA as a barcode , using a technique called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing . By using the technique , they can identify cells that express a specific gene , as well as identifying cells that have been infected with a particular virus . Wang and Wang also show that the technique can be implemented in other animals , like humans"

[ABSTRACT] In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics , we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins . Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration - passive accumulation - that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation . Here , we provide new data showing that , in contrast to previous studies , species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids . However , taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species , without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended . Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times . We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms . We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants , which are known sources of alkaloids . As a result , our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete . Thus , our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype . Understanding the origins of novel , complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] We also performed a highly sensitive , untargeted analysis -ultra-high-performance liquid-chromatography heated-electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS ) - of a dendrobatid from an undefended clade ( S. flotator ; 12 individuals ) and a species of eleutherodactylid ( Eleutherodactylus cystignathoides ; 3 individuals ) , in which alkaloid diversities and types , but not quantities , were assessed . The large number of structures that we identified is in part due to the way we reviewed GC-MS data : in addition to searching for alkaloids with known fragmentation patterns , we also searched for anything that could qualify as an alkaloid mass spectrometrically but that may not match a previously known structure in a reference database . This finding in concert with the detection of low levels of alkaloids in the lineages that putatively lack chemical defenses leads us to hypothesize that dietary shifts are not sufficient to explain the presence or absence of the chemical defense phenotype within Dendrobatidae or possibly in other families ( Bufonidae ) . Some appear to lack specific transport and storage mechanisms for consumed alkaloids ( 'sequestration ' ) , yet they have detectable levels of alkaloids in their skin ; we refer to this phenotype as passive accumulation and suggest that it is an evolutionary intermediate between toxin consumption ( with no sequestration ) and sequestration ( Figure 3 ) . Evidence for this passive-accumulation phenotype as an intermediate stage on the path towards toxin sequestration is scarce , but passive accumulation is a pervasive pattern in studies of ecological toxicology and may be more common in lineages that evolved toxin sequestration than we currently know . Once chemical defenses evolve , they are often further shaped by co-evolution between the defended prey and their predators , which can result in the appearance of visual or morphological signals , mimicry , and even the loss of defenses in the prey if the predator evolves sufficient resistance . By reviewing existing data , we found that only 31 of the 245 inconspicuous poison frog species described to date AmphibiaWeb , 2023 have been assessed for toxins , sometimes using methods that would not necessarily detect lipophilic alkaloids ( Supplementary file 2 ) . In a another example , the sawfly Athalia rosae shows constant turnover of its glucosinolate toxins , suggesting that these insects can not effectively store glucosinolates , yet their metabolic clearing is inefficient enough that they still maintain a high level of toxins in the hemolymph . In poison frogs and other toxin-accumulating animals , it is common to observe a few amino acid substitutions in ion channels that provide target-site resistance to alkaloids but adversely affect the function of the protein ; these substitutions are often accompanied by additional , compensatory substitutions that restore protein function without affecting resistance . ( 3 ) At two sites where the undefended species were prepared on a different day from the defended species ( Valle Hermoso : H. awa and Epipedobates boulengeri ; Canelos : L. fugax and Ameerega hahneli ) and could not have been cross-contaminated , the undefended species still show evidence of alkaloids . It is conceivable , then , that in some cases , passive accumulation could result in chemical defense through a mechanism that enables high net toxin intake , followed by evasion of elimination mechanisms , passive entry into the bloodstream , and diffusion into other tissues . Passive accumulation of toxins is not a novel concept , as it has been discussed previously in terms of self-medication and bioaccumulation , and we propose that it is also conceptually analogous to some medical treatments in humans such as chemotherapy . Acquired chemical defenses usually evolve within the context of a tri-trophic interaction : animals
[METHODS] ",,916,94,None,"Poison frogs are a family of animals that eat a wide variety of chemicals , including toxins , toxins and other chemicals . However , it is not clear how these chemicals are acquired from their diet . In fact , some species have evolved chemical defenses to protect themselves from the toxins they ingest . This is known as passive accumulation , which is the process by which toxins accumulate in the body . The process is called “sequestration” , and it involves a process called transport and storage , where toxins are stored in the skin of the prey . It is also known that some species of poison-frog are able to acquire alkaloids from their food , but this is not the case in other species , such as the nematode S . flotator or the eleutherodactylid . Toxins can be found in many different types of food . For example , the feces of these species are often found in ants and mites , while others are found in insects and insects . Some of these toxins can be absorbed into the skin by the sex of the predators . But it is unclear how the odor of the ants can be transmitted to the predator . Now , Wang et al . have developed a new model that could help explain the origins of chemical defense in poison larks and other animals . These models are based on data collected from a group of poison flies that are known to have acquired toxins from the diet of other species of the same family . They found that some of the species that were unable to acquire toxins had a low level of alkaloides in their skin . Wang "

[ABSTRACT] In this study , we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells . The complexity of EMT , involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process , mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ) , has hindered the development of effective treatments . Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer . RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signalings are essential for EMT/MET completion . Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies . Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) contributes significantly to chemotherapy resistance and remains a critical challenge in treating advanced breast cancer . Our findings revealed elevated ribosome biogenesis ( RiBi ) during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes . Importantly , inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Of note , some commonly used chemotherapeutics ( Cisplatin , 5FU , Doxorubicin , etc ) , although primarily targeting DNA duplications , may also affect the RiBi pathway by inhibiting rRNA processing . found that elevated rRNA synthesis/RiBi pathway was concomitant with cell cycle arrest induced by TGFβ , fueling the EMT program in breast tumor cells . Targeting EMT for cancer therapy has been challenging due to the complexity of the EMT process and controversies of promoting MET which also favors tumor progression . Using the Tri-PyMT model , we found that the EMT transitioning ( Doub+ ) cells had higher percentages of cells in the S and G2/M phases compared to the RFP + and GFP + cells . By employing our unique EMT-lineage-tracing model , we discovered that the RiBi pathway was transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of EMT/MET program . Importantly , the involvement of unwonted RiBi activities during both EMT and MET processes makes RiBi a new and better target for overcoming EMT-related chemoresistance and chemoresistant metastasis . These observations also suggest that malignant cells may require a certain ease to 'ping pong ' between epithelial and mesenchymal states to adapt to the challenging microenvironment . Targeting the RiBi pathway by RNase Pol I inhibitor impaired the EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells and significantly synergized with common chemotherapeutics . Using the EMT-lineage-tracing model , we found an upregulation of the RiBi pathway at the transitioning phase of both EMT and MET ( Figure 7 ) . A more recent study identified a subpopulation of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) in which high RiBi activities persisted to maintain their high metastatic potentials . Its involvement in the EMT/MET process makes it a feasible targeted pathway for treating patients with advanced breast cancer . Additionally , further investigations are needed to determine whether a cell could complete the EMT process within a single cell cycle or requires multiple cell divisions . This is inconsistent with the observation that RiBi activity was higher in G1-arrested cells treated with TGFβ . Interestingly , the RiBi activity was associated with epithelial phenotypes rather than mesenchymal ones in CTCs . Indeed , EMT induction by TGFβ primarily suppressed ribosome gene expression and global translational activity . This discrepancy may be due to the different EMT stimuli used in the experiment systems . In general , a lower RiBi activity was observed in the mesenchymal tumor cells than in the epithelial ones . The enhanced activation of the RiBi pathway diminished as tumor cells accomplished phenotype changes . The transient activation of the RiBi pathway during the EMT process has been reported previously . Moreover , RiBi is a process that is dysregulated in most , if not all , cancers . Therefore , the synergic effects of Pol I inhibitor varied among different combinations . Prakash et al .

However , it is not clear how the process of reversing the progression of cancer is carried out .

These experiments showed that the RNA biosynthesis pathway was elevated during the transition phases of both EMT and MET processes .

[ABSTRACT] In summary , our study suggests a conserved function for GRX genes in conferring root cell elongation and enhancing resilience of pearl millet to its Sahelian environment . Combining gene expression data , re-sequencing and re-annotation of one of these genomic regions identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene PgGRXC9 as the candidate stress resilience root growth regulator . Pearl millet is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops that provides a vital food source across the sub-Saharan Sahel region . Using crop modeling , we demonstrate that early drought stress is an important constraint in agrosystems in the Sahel where pearl millet was domesticated . Functional characterization of its closest Arabidopsis homolog AtROXY19 revealed a novel role for this glutaredoxin ( GRX ) gene clade in regulating cell elongation . Pearl millet 's early root system features a single fast-growing primary root which we hypothesize is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate . Furthermore , we show that increased pearl millet primary root growth is correlated with increased early water stress tolerance in field conditions . Genetics including genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) approaches identify genomic regions controlling this key root trait . Seedling root traits impact plant establishment under challenging environments .

[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] It invests the available seed reserves toward the growth of a unique primary root to rapidly colonize deeper soil layers rather than forming more root axes ( seminal roots for example ) as seen in other cereals . Based on our results , we speculate that this specific early root development strategy was selected during evolution to cope with the specific rain pattern encountered in the Sahel . Its seeds are small ( 8 mg on average , about 5 and 20 times lighter than wheat or maize seeds , respectively , for example ) with limited reserves available for early seedling growth . Pearl millet evolved and was domesticated in the Sahel .

[ABSTRACT] Here , the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts was investigated during movie watching to address the extent to which brain responses dynamically change depending on visual context . These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences , the underlying neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information . Specifically , the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when these are processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning . First , across contexts , concrete and abstract concepts are shown to encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions . Language is acquired and processed in complex and dynamic naturalistic contexts , involving the simultaneous processing of connected speech , faces , bodies , objects , etc . Conversely , when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word , the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing . How words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing is still unknown . However , these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Apart from commercial applications , gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying naturalistic conceptual processing in the brain might bear important implications for clinical domains , e. g. , by informing progress towards helping patients who lost the ability to speak by real-time semantic reconstruction of non-invasive brain recordings with the help of large language models . These more distributed regions may be averaged away when indiscriminately analyzed together and following thresholding because ( i ) they are more variable given they are associated with different experiences ( as we have seen here ) , linguistic categories , and processes ( e. g. different types of syntax ) ( ii ) there are individual differences in all of these . We propose that this is because , when a concrete concept is processed in a displaced context , its representation will relate more to internal/interoceptive variables and linguistic associations , which are usually encoded by abstract concepts . This paves the way for future analyses systematically quantifying different types of contexts ( e. g. in terms of related objects , actions , emotions , or social interactions ) and examining how these can affect conceptual processing in the brain . Though results across contexts presumably represent a form of experiential central tendency , the behavioral , neuroimaging , and electrophysiological literature suggests that conceptual representations might not be stable and may vary as a function of context . This view fits well with models of 'natural ' organization of language in the brain where it is argued that language processing more generally is a whole brain process whose patterns of activation are determined by available context . Given the hypothesis that conceptual representations reflect contextual information , we expected a set of regions that correspond to the most typical set of experiences ( e. g. as encountered during word learning in development ) to activate across different contexts . Overlap between activation for concrete concepts in displaced conditions and abstract concepts across context ( Figure 5A ) can be found in ACC , thalamus , and large swaths of the anterior , middle , and posterior temporal lobe . Recent literature on the role of the DMN suggests that these regions reactivate memories and contexts-specific information , possibly to form contextually relevant situation models , in order to guide semantic cognition . For this reason , we conducted a second set of analyses with the goal of understanding the extent to which representations associated with concrete or abstract conceptual processing in the brain change as a function of context . In considering the impact of visual context on the neural encoding of concepts generally , it is furthermore essential to recognize that the mechanisms observed may extend beyond visual processing to encompass more general sensory processing mechanisms . While our findings highlight the role of visual context in modulating the neural representation of abstract and concrete words , similar effects may be observed in contexts that engage other sensory modalities . Conversely , our study found that abstract word processing preferentially engages a network of regions within the left hemisphere , including the inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) , superior and middle temporal gyri , and the inferior parietal lobule . Breaking up the interaction between word_type and context , we find that the DMN is especially involved in displaced conditions for both concrete and abstract conceptual processing ( see Figure 4A , B ( blue ) ) . Consistent with this , both meta-analytic and peak and valley analyses showed that concrete regions were more associated with sensory-motor properties ( e. g. 'Movement ' and 'Hand_Arm ' ) whereas abstract regions were more associated with internal/interoceptive/affective properties ( e. g. 'Valence ; ' Figures 2 and 3 ) . The human brain is adept at integrating information across sensory modalities to form coherent conceptual representations , a process that is critical for navigating the multimodal nature of real-world experiences . Our results indicate that
[METHODS] ",,878,92,None,"The brain is made up of a number of different regions , including the frontal lobes , the thalamus , and the hippocampus . These regions are involved in processing information about the world around us , such as how we communicate with others , how we interact with other people , etc . The brain also processes information about our environment , which is referred to as the ‘real world’ . For example , if we are watching a movie , our brain processes information from the surrounding environment . However , it is not clear how this information is processed in the brain . To address this question , Wang et al . studied the brains of people who were watching movies . They found that when the movie was not related to a given concrete word , their brains responded more strongly to it . In contrast , when it was unrelated to the given concrete phrase , they responded more positively to it than to it was in the context of the movie . Wang also found that , in contrast to the visual context , abstract concepts were more likely to be processed in a set of brain regions . This suggests that the brain is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information . Moreover , these findings suggest that the underlying brain processes are not fixed ."

[ABSTRACT] Most importantly , KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells . This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor , KVS0001 , that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo . As an intrinsic cellular pathway , nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations . We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen , based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts , to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells . Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy , its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface . KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role , including cancer and inherited diseases . This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1 's phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Whether this failure to cure tumors in mice results from the contrived nature of the models used - injection of large numbers of rapidly growing cancer cells into animals with relatively little time to react prior to their demise - complicates the interpretation of many pre-clinical immunotherapeutic approaches . Another unrelated compound has shown successful in vivo re-expression of mutant RNA transcripts , but the effect is reported as less than a twofold change , compared to the three to fourfold demonstrated here by KVS0001 , and little work has been done to develop the compound further in subsequent studies . This is an important feature , as many previously reported inhibitors of NMD , such as emetine and anisomycin , rely on inhibition of protein translation and thus are unlikely to be optimal for specific restoration of NMD-targeted RNA and protein expression . It is not clear to us why this occurred , but we speculate that it may be related to differences in the mechanism of action ( i. e. , protein synthesis inhibition-based NMD effects versus targeted NMD pathway inhibition as one example ) . The limited impact on body weight or observed physical activity of mice undergoing KVS0001 therapy at therapeutically relevant doses suggests that NMD inhibition may have acceptable toxicity and be tolerated in developed animals . Similar speculations can be made about the potential of KVS0001 to be used to prevent cancer initiation or progression in patients with other inherited mutations in repair genes , or in individuals exposed to high levels of exogenous mutagens . Despite these chemistry-related challenges , our screen offered an unbiased assessment of the best targets for NMD pathway disruption , and thus we concluded that SMG1 was an ideal protein to inhibit for this purpose . Should the administration of KVS0001 or a related compound prove non-toxic and well tolerated in humans , we end with a speculation about the possibility of KVS0001 being used as a preventative rather than as a therapeutic agent . The broad use of NMD in normal development and growth , coupled with the observations here , suggests future work with inhibitors of this pathway should continue with a close eye for on-target off-tissue toxicity . Another example of this lies in the natural genetic variants of NMD components , which convey variability in the efficiency of NMD between humans , and lends itself to supporting that knockdown of this pathway may be tolerable . Unlike previous NMD screens , this assay is directed at NMD as a process rather than as a way to identify compounds for treating specific mutations related to a disease state , such as cystic fibrosis or β-thalassemia . These patients inherit heterozygous mutations of a mismatch repair gene , and they do not develop tumors until biallelic mutations of that mismatch repair gene are acquired in a rare stem cell during the second or third decade of life . We developed a new bispecific antibody , KVS-B043 , which could recognize these pHLA complexes when the truncating mutations were present in the TP53 gene and destroy cancer cells harboring such mutations . The optimal inhibitor of NMD found in our screen was LY3023414 , and we suspected that this compound may inhibit the kinase SMG1 based on previously published kinase activity data with this small molecule . Finally , KVS0001 , though it was soluble and could be administered to animals for at least a month , was not entirely non-toxic , causing transient weight loss in some of the mice . Follow-up experiments confirmed a low false positive rate in the screen : four of the eight hits re-expressed transcripts from genes with truncating mutations in a dose-responsive manner when re-tested . Note that our assay allows for the detection of NMD inhibitors regardless of effects on protein translation by virtue of the comparison of wild-type to mutant transcripts for each queried gene . This situation is reminiscent of that encountered with immune checkpoint inhibitors",,878,92,None,"Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide , and it is one of the most common cancers in the world . It is caused by a mutation in a gene called nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) , which causes the DNA to be destroyed by the cell . NMD is an intrinsic cellular process that involves the destruction of the RNA products from genes that harbor truncating mutations . This process is known as ‘nonsense’ , because it is able to remove the neoantigens that are present on the surface of cancer cells . However , it is not clear how this process works . To investigate this question , Wang et al . have developed a new inhibitor of NMD called KVS0001 . The inhibitor , named KVS001 , targets a protein called SMG1 – which is involved in the production of RNA molecules – that can be used to target a variety of genes . Wang flies with the inhibitor in vivo , but it was not clear whether it could be used in humans or in mice . In the experiments , the mice were injected with a drug called emetine , a chemical that inhibits a key enzyme in the enzyme . These mice were then given a dose of the drug and , after a few weeks , they developed tumors in their skin . Using a technique called ratiometric analysis , Zhang ed . found that the inhibitor boosted the expression of a number of genes that are involved in NMD in human cells , including a molecule called HLA class I peptides , that can also be used as antigens against cancer cells in mice and humans . Furthermore , this drug could be applied to other diseases "

[ABSTRACT] We generated PhenoAge using chronological age and nine biomarkers , PhenoAgeAccel after subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression residual , and an incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score ( CPRS ) based on 20 cancer site-specific polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ) . Within and across genetic risk groups , older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer with adjustment for chronological age and the aging process could be retarded by adherence to a healthy lifestyle . Using Cox regression models , we examined the association of Phenotypic Age Acceleration ( PhenoAgeAccel ) with cancer incidence by genetic risk group among 374 , 463 participants from the UK Biobank . We explored a new measure of aging-Phenotypic Age ( PhenoAge ) -in the risk prediction of site-specific and overall cancer . Compared with biologically younger participants , those older had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer , with hazard ratios ( HRs ) of 1 . This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ; and the Excellent Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province . Age is the most important risk factor for cancer , but aging rates are heterogeneous across individuals . A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel was observed on overall cancer risk , with HRs of 2 . 11 ) for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared with those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge . PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors ( Beta = -1 . 22 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 31 ) in women , respectively . 51 ) for men and 1 . 27 ) in men , and 1 . 01 in men , p < 0 . 98 in women , p < 0 . 001 ; Beta = -0 . 18-1 . 26 ( 1 . 22-1 . 29 ( 2 . 10-2 . 94 ( 1 . 78-2 . 001 ) .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Older age has been long recognized as the main risk factor for cancer , and the multistage model of carcinogenesis posits that the exponential increase in cancer incidence with age were mainly resulted from the sequential accumulation of oncogenic mutations in different tissues throughout life . Based on data from the UK Biobank , recently explored the associations between telomere length and risk of several diseases , and reported significant positive associations of telomere length for lymphoid leukemia , multiple myeloma , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , esophagus cancer , while negative associations for malignant neoplasm of brain , mesothelioma , and melanoma . In summary , our study showed that accelerated aging , which was measured by PhenoAgeAccel , was consistently related to an increased risk of several site-specific cancer and overall cancer with adjustment for chronological age , within and across genetic risk groups . The associations between biological age and cancer risk has been investigated by several studies recently explored three DNA methylation phenotypic age and cancer risk in four subsets of a population-based cohort from Germany , and reported strong positive associations for lung cancer , while strong inverse associations for breast cancer . PhenoAgeAccel can serve as a productive tool to facilitate the identification of cancer susceptible individuals , in combination with individual 's genetic background , and act as an intermediate phenotype to guide interventions for high-risk groups and track intervention efficacy . Moreover , we also demonstrated that participants with older biological age often reaches the screening threshold 2 years in advance compared with biologically younger peers ; and keeping a healthy lifestyle can effectively slow down the aging process . In other words , these healthy lifestyles considered in our and previous studies may be causal drivers of phenotypic aging , they represent a more targetable strategy for reducing overall cancer burden by retarding the aging process . Mak et al. , 2023 explored three measures of biological age , including PhenoAge , and assessed their associations with the incidence of overall cancer and five common cancers ( breast , prostate , lung , colorectal , and melanoma ) . In this study , we calculated PhenoAgeAccel to explore the effect of accelerated aging on the risk of cancer , and demonstrated a positive association between accelerated aging and increased cancer risk after adjustment for chronological age in the UK Biobank . This was in accordance with our findings that , adherence to healthy lifestyles ( involving no current smoking , normal BMI , regular physical activity , and healthy diet ) could slow down the aging process . In addition to genetics , behaviors ( i. e. obesity , smoking , alcohol consumption , and physical activity ) , and life course circumstances ( i. e. socioenvironmental circumstances during childhood and adulthood ) were reported to account for about 30 % variances of phenotypic aging . Therefore , several biomarkers , i. e. , 'aging clocks ' derived from epigenomic , transcriptomic , proteomic , and metabolomic data , have been proposed to measure the biological age and predict the risk of cancer and other diseases . Finally , even though the findings were achieved from participants with diverse ethnic backgrounds of the UK Biobank , the generalizability of our findings should be further assessed in more diverse populations when available . This study has several strengths , including a large sample size , a prospective design of the UK Biobank study , and an effective application of PhenoAgeAccel in predicting the risk of overall
[METHODS] ",,960,96,None,"Age is the most important factor in determining the risk of developing cancer . However , the age of a person can also be a factor . For example , if someone is older than 30 , they are more likely to develop cancer , and if they are older than 50 , their risk of cancer is higher . This is because older people have a higher chance of developing a cancer compared to younger people . In this study , Wang et al . used a new measure of aging-Phenotypic Age ( PhenoAgeAccel ) to measure the risk for cancer in 374 , 463 participants from the UK Biobank . The results showed that , while older people had a lower risk of having a particular type of cancer – lung cancer — they were more at risk for other types of cancers , including breast cancer and melanoma . Moreover , those who were older had an even higher risk of getting a specific type of tumor . These findings suggest that a healthy lifestyle can help to slow down the aging process , which could be beneficial for cancer prevention ."

[ABSTRACT] Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved accuracy . The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data , compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas , may explain this improvement . Species identification accuracy exceeds 95 % for birds , reptiles , mammals , and amphibians , but seed plants , molluscs , and fishes scored below 90 % . The Biome mobile app , launched in Japan , efficiently gathers species observations from the public using species identification algorithms and gamification elements . Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions , aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment . Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems . Here , we investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on SDM performance . For endangered species , traditional survey data required > 2000 records for accurate models ( Boyce index ≥ 0 . 9 ) , while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300 . Nonetheless , community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases . Species distribution models ( SDMs ) estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias . The app has amassed > 6 million observations since 2019 . Comprehensive biodiversity data is crucial for ecosystem protection .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Engaging a broader spectrum of stakeholders is crucial for effective biodiversity assessment , nature management planning , and nature-related financial disclosures : this inclusivity allows for the incorporation of traditional knowledge into planning processes , mitigates conflicts among stakeholders , and ultimately supports more seamless and informed decision-making . For instance , estimated distributions will be useful in selecting new protected areas or areas with Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures ( OECMs ) : allowing a wider range of land use as long as biodiversity and ecosystem services are sustained/improved . The most accurate model predictions were obtained when the training data consisted of 50-70 % Biome data ( Appendix 1 ) , highlighting the necessity of incorporating both traditional surveys and citizen observations for a comprehensive understanding of species distributions . By leveraging the distinct distribution patterns of Biome and Traditional survey data along environmental variables ( Figure 2C ) , the test data would better encapsulate the actual species distribution compared to datasets composed solely of either Biome or Traditional survey data . The rapid accumulation of Biome data will allow us to evaluate the temporal transferability using the occurrence dataset from different time periods , and thus enable assessing their performance in much wider regions . Although few studies have simultaneously assessed the quality of community-sourced data and its impact on SDMs across different taxa , it is important to recognise that data quality can vary among taxa . Yet , SDMs can make such surveys cost-effective by screening important locations for on-site assessment ( e. g. Locate phase in TNFD framework ) and narrowing down the target species for surveying . Because SDMs allow us to simulate the impacts of changes in landuse and climate , we will be able to forecast how those changes may influence local biodiversity and/or ecosystem functioning . Notably , for insects and birds , which encompass numerous species that can be kept in captivity , the majority of records that underwent filtering procedures were restricted to observations of wild individuals . Despite our concerted efforts to engage non-expert users through gamification features , it is important to acknowledge that an excessive influx of non-expert users could potentially compromise the quality of the collected data . In comparison to other taxonomic groups , our results indicate that seed plants exhibited lower model accuracy when evaluated against both Biome + Traditional survey data ( Figure 3 ) and Traditional survey data alone ( Figure 3-figure supplement 1 ) . For instance , Biome data has hinted at potential range expansions in several insect species , including butterflies , dragonflies , and stink bugs , as well as changes in wintering areas for birds . We believe that community science can significantly contribute to KM-GBF and create a sustainable society by fostering nature-positive awareness in society and providing data tools that enable effective action . Consequently , this might lead to better estimation of species absence in such areas , not just presence , resulting in an overall increase in model accuracy across a wider range of species . It is noteworthy that , even when the test data exclusively consisted of Traditional survey data ( i. e. unfavourable conditions for Biome + Traditional data SDMs ) , the accuracy of SDMs derived from Biome + Traditional and Traditional survey data did not differ ( Figure 3-figure supplement 1 ) . In addition , limited data availability for certain taxa hindered the assessment in those taxa ( e. g. molluscs , amphibians , reptiles , and mammals ) , but Biome would be a platform to overcome the data limitation for many taxa . In our investigation , we observed that incorporating Biome data improved SDM accuracy for seed plants and insects , while the impact on birds remained unclear ( Figure 3 ) . Moreover , Biome
[METHODS] ",,901,93,None,"The ecosystems of the world are made up of many different species , including plants , animals , and other animals . However , it is not clear how these species are distributed , or how they are adapted to survive in the environment . In fact , some species are more likely to be found in areas that are less protected than others , such as forests , rivers , lakes , etc . Using a mobile app called Biome , researchers in Japan have developed a method for collecting and analyzing biodiversity data from the public . The app consists of a series of sensors that can be used to measure the distribution of species . These sensors allow the researchers to see which species are most likely to live in the area . This information is then used to create a model of the population , which can then be compared to the data collected by the researchers . It is important to understand how the data is collected , because it can be difficult to identify species based on traditional survey data . To do this , the researchers need to combine the data from different sources . For example , if a species is found in a forest , they need to collect a large number of records . But if the data are collected from a community , this could be a problem , as it could be biased towards natural areas . Now , Wang et al . have used the Biome mobile app to assess the quality of the collected data and how it affects the performance of the models . They found that the Biomes data were more accurate than the traditional surveys , suggesting that combining the two data sources could improve the accuracy of the model . Wang "

[ABSTRACT] In the present study using genetic mouse models , we dissected the roles of bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 1a ( Bmpr1a ) -mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and discovered that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis , leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions . However , deletion of Smad1/5 , two major BMP signaling downstream effectors , from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs , suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions . Although the cystic lesions are believed to result directly from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth , the extent to which developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells contribute to abnormal airway epithelial cell growth and subsequent cystic lesions has not been thoroughly examined . In addition , ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs . These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts . Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs . Abnormal lung development can cause congenital pulmonary cysts , the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] It is worthy to note that airway smooth muscles are normal in these elastin null mice , implying that loss of elastic fiber alone is not sufficient to cause airway cystic pathology , but could serve as an additional factor contributing to the lesions in vivo . This aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute to airway cyst formation , as multiple mouse models have suggested that loss of Sox2+ or expansion of Sox9+ in airway epithelia are associated with altered epithelial differentiation and branching , as well as cystic pathology in fetal lungs . Evidence increasingly suggests that the lung mesenchyme is closely involved in respiratory lineage specification and epithelial differentiation by producing many critical signaling molecules , such as Bmp ligands , that direct endodermal expression of specific cell markers in a temporal and spatial fashion . It has been reported that epithelial overexpression of Bmp4 appears to induce extensive mesenchymal SMC differentiation in vivo , and that BMP4 promotes myocyte differentiation and inhibits cell proliferation in cultured human fetal lung fibroblasts via the Smad1 pathway . Although the congenital pulmonary cysts in CPAM patients can be identified by a prenatal ultrasound examination , the tissue specimens for pathological analysis are only available from postnatal surgery , when advanced airway cysts have already developed . Although reduced expression of Bmpr1a is associated with various forms of acquired as well as primary nonfamilial pulmonary hypertension , the role of Bmpr1a-mediated signaling in regulating prenatal lung vascular SMC development has not been studied . Our previous study has demonstrated that Myocd is abundant in airway SMCs but barely expressed in vascular SMCs , and that cardiovascular SMC development is mediated by myocardin-related transcription factors , the other members of Myocd family . However , our in vivo study indicates that simultaneous deletion of Smad1 and Smad5 in mouse lung mesenchyme does not affect the differentiation of airway SMCs although it disrupts early embryonic lung morphogenesis . Previous studies have shown that disruption of BMP signaling by LDN-193189 can substantially improve Bmp4 production , and that deletion of Bmpr1a and Acvr1 in the lens-forming ectoderm increases Bmp2 , -4 , and -7 transcripts . Inhibition of SMC differentiation in embryonic lung explant culture , such as by blocking L-type Ca2+ channels using nifedipine , or by inhibiting FGF and SHH signaling using SU5402SHH and cyclopamine , prevented airway terminal bifurcation . This suggests that loss of SMCs is neither the primary nor sole mechanism accounting for the reduction of airway branching , dilation of terminal airways , and development of airway cysts in our Bmpr1a CKO lungs . Consistently , overexpression of Bmp antagonist Xnoggin or gremlin in fetal distal lung epithelium leads to a severe reduction of distal epithelial cell types and a concurrent expanded expression of the proximal epithelial cell markers CC10 and Foxj1 . Previous study has revealed that the perinatal development of terminal airway branches is arrested in mice lacking elastin ( Eln -/- ) , resulting in dilated distal air sacs that form abnormally large cavities . However , Bmpr1a , p38 , and Myocd are not critical in fetal pulmonary vascular SMC development , and inhibition of these molecules in vivo and in vitro does not have any observable effect on vascular SMCs in fetal lungs . Despite being commonly characterized by the expression of a variety of myogenesis-associated genes , airway and vascular SMCs seem to originate from distinct mesenchymal progenitor populations , and are regulated by distinct molecular mechanisms . Therefore , the decrease in proximal cell types and ectopic expression of distal cell markers ( Sox9 ) in the Bmpr1a CKO lungs may be subsequently caused by abnormal increase of Bmp ligands . Interestingly , elastin expression in the developing lung parenchyma prior to alveologenesis is predominantly localized to the mesenchyme in the developing
[METHODS] ",,905,94,None,"The airways in the lungs are made up of many different types of cells , including muscle cells . These cells are known as mesenchymal cells and are responsible for the development of the lung . However , it is not clear how these cells develop and develop , and how they contribute to the development and development of these cells ? To investigate this question , a group of scientists have developed a mouse model of a disease called congenital pulmonary cysts . The mice were genetically engineered to have a protein called bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 1a ( Bmpr1a ) , which is found in the airways of fetuses and other animals . This protein is known to be involved in the formation of cysts in the lung and is also known to play an important role in the development or development of lungs . Previous studies have shown that the BMP receptor is a key component of the pulmonary fibroblasts that make up the lung's surface , but it has not been studied in detail . Now , Wang et al . have used a genetic mouse model to study the role of BMP in the growth of the mesentchymal airways . In the experiments , the mice were injected with a drug called a gene called BMP4 . It was found that the mice had abnormal growth of elastin fibers in their airways and that this was due to a mutation in one of the genes , BMP1 . Wang "

[ABSTRACT] However , the role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells is not fully understood , as it is difficult to visualize the local lipid domains around EGFR . Here , we visualized both EGFR and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy . Artificial reduction in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF . The EGFR and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains . Anionic lipid molecules , including phosphatidylinositol-4 , 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) , are implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Thus , EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 around EGFR molecules were found to be mutually regulated . The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ , the EGFR effector hydrolyzing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . Inhibition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Together with these observations , our biochemical analyses suggest that the local distribution of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 around EGFR before EGF stimulation not only acts as the substrate of EGFR effectors , including PI3K and PLCγ , after EGF stimulation , but also plays a crucial role in enhancing the dimerization and kinase activation of EGFR immediately after EGF stimulation ( Figure 7E , left ) . Previous electron microscopy-bivariate analyses showed that the nanodomains of inactive HRAS were enriched with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , whereas those of active KRAS4B were enriched with PS due to highly specific RAS-lipid interactions determined by the membrane curvature . Such faint increases were difficult to observe in our SMLM imaging under dense EGFR expression ( Figure 1 ) ; however , SMT analysis detected increases in the singe-spot fluorescence intensities , which is consistent with EGF-induced EGFR clustering . Together with the results of the present study , this suggests that cholesterol- and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2-rich membrane domains exist in the plasma membrane , form higher-order aggregates , and transiently colocalize with EGFR clusters before EGF stimulation . Therefore , the EGFR-EGFR-PLCγ and EGFR-ERBB3-PI3K complexes exist separately in the plasma membrane after EGF stimulation , which is consistent with the results in Figure 6-figure supplement 1E and F. Upon EGF stimulation , EGFR preferentially phosphorylates EGFR rather than ERBB3 . The small aggregation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains in wortmannin-treated cells ( Figure 6-figure supplement 1A ) may indicate newly synthesized or partially degraded PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains at the plasma membrane after EGF stimulation . However , we can not exclude the possibility that the dimer/oligomers in the slow- and fast-mobile fractions were also stabilized by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , which was not detected by the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 probes . In contrast , a decrease in the colocalization rate between EGFR and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 after EGF stimulation was observed in the slow- and fast-mobile fractions but not in the immobile fraction ( Figure 3-figure supplement 1D ) . These findings are consistent with previous in vitro and in silico observations that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 interacts strongly with the arginine residues in the JM-A region of EGFR , stabilizing the active conformation of EGFR . Consistent with this , in our experiment , the expression of DN PLCγ did not induce DAG production ( Figure 6B ) or Thr654 phosphorylation ( Figure 7A and B ) , but increased the Tyr1068 phosphorylation of EGFR ( Figure 7A and B ) . This is supported by our results , which show that both ERBB3 and EGFR are required for EGF-induced AKT phosphorylation ( Figure 6-figure supplement 1C , D ) . SMT analysis revealed that EGFR monomers decreased and dimers increased in the immobile fraction of control CHO-K1 cells after EGF stimulation ( Figure 4A ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains may suppress EGFR signaling in the resting state despite their stabilizing effect on the JM-A dimer of EGFR during its kinase activation . The PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 probes employed in the present study detect PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 near EGFR but they might not bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 associated with EGFR due to steric hindrance . Needham et al. , 2016 and Mudumbi et al. , 2024 reported an increase in the size of single EGFR clusters after EGF stimulation as an indication of clustering using superresolution microscopy . In contrast , synaptojanin expression reduces PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 levels by 45 % , leading to defects
[METHODS] ",,907,94,None,"Cells are made up of many different types of cells , and each cell has a specific type of cell . Each cell contains a receptor called EGFR , which is responsible for regulating the activity of the cell’s immune system . However , it is not clear how the receptor interacts with other molecules in the cell , such as cholesterol , to control its activity . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called super-resolution single-molecule microscopy to study the interaction between the receptor and a protein called PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . The experiments showed that PI and P2 are found in the plasma membrane of cells that have been treated with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) . When EGF is activated , the receptor is able to bind to the PI/P2 nanodomains in the membrane . This is because the lipids that surround the receptor are known as lipid-like molecules . Wang , Zhang , Liu , Yin ed . have now used this technique to show that the peptide-like lipid molecules that surround EGF are also present at the membrane of the cells that are treated with EGF and that they also interact with the receptor . These findings suggest that , in the presence of PI or P2 on the membrane before EGF stimulation , these molecules are more likely to interact with each other . In addition , this suggests that if EGF stimulates the receptor in the same way as the receptor does , then the receptor can be activated by the phosphatidylinositol-4 , 5-bisphosphate ( PI4 ) and PI3K . Further experiments revealed that the concentration of the phospholipid"

[ABSTRACT] The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP , which powers energy-requiring processes , such as macromolecular synthesis , as well as NADH , used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules . Given its unique substrate specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism , the carrier for glycolytic intermediates identified here represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens , which are of great economic importance . Comparative analyses with the phylogenetically related human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier ( SLC25A11 ) and dicarboxylate carrier ( SLC25A10 ) show that the glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate . Stramenopiles form a clade of diverse eukaryotic organisms , including multicellular algae , the fish and plant pathogenic oomycetes , such as the potato blight Phytophthora , and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis . Here , we identify a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocystis that can transport glycolytic intermediates , such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate , across the mitochondrial inner membrane , linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis . In most eukaryotes , glycolysis is a strictly cytosolic metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate , resulting in the production of NADH and ATP ( Adenosine triphosphate ) . Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP , such as complexes III and IV , ATP synthase , and ADP/ATP carriers . In contrast , stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis in which the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Cytosolic ATP can be supplied either through the export of PEP by bGIC-2 , as explained , or via a mitochondrial carrier that shares properties with the mitochondrial Mg-ATP/Pi carrier , which is generally used to equilibrate adenine nucleotide pools between the matrix and cytosol . The plant carriers catalyse the transport of tricarboxylates ( citrate , isocitrate , and aconitate ) in exchange for dicarboxylates ( oxoglutarate , oxaloacetate , malate , maleate , succinate , and malonate ) and are also present in Alveolata , Rhizaria , and Haptophyta , which share a common evolutionary ancestor with stramenopiles . In most other eukaryotes , cytosolic NADH is oxidized by the malate-aspartate shuttle , but this pathway requires an orthologue of the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier , which could not be identified in Blastocystis , even though it might have a mitochondrial glutamate carrier ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1 ) . In its natural environment , Blastocystis likely uses protons as terminal electron acceptors by using pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase , which would result in the production of hydrogen and a range of fermentative products , such as lactate , acetate , and propionate . A mitochondrial phosphate carrier homologue was identified in the phylogenetic analysis of Blastocystis ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1 ) , which is driven by the proton motive force to maintain high concentrations of phosphate in the mitochondrial matrix , which in turn could drive the uptake of glycolytic intermediates . We also characterized the substrate specificity of Blastocystis OGC , which has the same specificity as human OGC ( SLC25A11 ) , and we demonstrated that it is unable to transport glycolytic intermediates and thus could not be the missing transport step in the branched glycolytic pathway . In addition , two NAD+ molecules are reduced to NADH , which can be used by complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and the uptake of ions and molecules into mitochondria , such as phosphate . Additionally , the distantly related citrate carrier , which transports dicarboxylates , tricarboxylates , and PEP , was also lost in Blastocystis , possibly due to an incomplete tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle devoid of citrate synthase , aconitase , isocitrate dehydrogenase , and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase . Through the discovery of this carrier , we have linked the two halves of glycolysis and provided a potential target for specific treatment not only for Blastocystis but also for other stramenopile pathogens that threaten global food security . In contrast to bGIC-1 , bGIC-2 transports several inorganic ions and glycolytic intermediates , including dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ( Figure 6D ) , but not the canonical substrates of Blastocystis OGC , such as malate , maleate , malonate , and succinate . The degradation of one glucose molecule in the cytosol requires one ATP and one pyrophosphate molecule , but will generate four ATP molecules in the mitochondrial matrix , which can be used for ATP-requiring processes , such as protein import , mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription , and mitochondrial protein synthesis . When PEP is exported by bGIC-2 , it could be converted into pyruvate and lactate by cytosolic pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase , respectively , which would lead to the synthesis of ATP and the conversion of NADH to NAD+ in the cytosol . However , as a likely adaptation to the anoxic environment , Blastocystis has lost some of the canonical components of oxidative phosphorylation , including complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain , ATP-synthase and mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers . Blastocystis was used in this study as a stramenopile model organism , as it relies
[METHODS] ",,932,95,None,"Stramenopiles are a group of eukaryotic organisms that live in the gut . The bacteria that cause stramenopile infection are found in many different species , including humans , animals , and plants . Most of these organisms have a single mitochondrial membrane that is made up of two layers of cells , called the cytosol and the mitochondrial inner membrane . This membrane contains the enzymes that convert glucose into pyruvate , which is then converted into ATP . However , it is not clear how the ATP is produced in the mitochondria . To investigate this question , Liu et al . studied the mitochondria of the human protozoan Blastocystis , a bacterium that causes a variety of diseases in humans and other animals .

Liu and Liu found that a protein called ATP can be transported from the mitochondria to the inner membrane of a cell , where it can be used to produce ATP and other molecules . These proteins are also found in the outer layer of the mitochondria and are used to generate ATP from the oxidative energy that is produced by the phosphorylation of the phosphate groups in the atoms . In addition , they are also present in other organisms such as the potato blight Phytophthora and the human intestinal parasite , the potato-blight pathogen Blastophora . Interestingly , this protein was not found in Blasstophora , although it was found in other eucalyptus species . It is thought that ATP"

[ABSTRACT] We propose a new framework for human genetic association studies : at each locus , a deep learning model ( in this study , Sei ) is used to calculate the functional genomic activity score for two haplotypes per individual . Lastly , we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO ) regression to integrate HFS prediction score with SNP-based polygenic risk scores , which showed an improvement of 16 . Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations , corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared with single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) -based analysis . HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait associations and 153 tissue-trait associations with strong biological interpretability , including 'circadian pathway-chronotype ' and 'arachidonic acid-intelligence ' . Applying the HFS framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank , we identified 3619 independent HFS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8 . We concluded that HFS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits . This score , defined as the Haplotype Function Score ( HFS ) , replaces the original genotype in association studies . 8 % in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction . 1-39 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In this study , we designed the new HFS framework for genetic association analysis and demonstrated that it could improve classic SNP-based analysis in terms of causal loci and gene identification , biological interpretation and polygenic prediction . For those false-positive variants caused by LD , they are expected to make little impacts on functional genomics , thus their HFS would be close to reference and would not influence downstream analysis significantly . In summary , our results demonstrate that incorporating HFS to represent genetically determined functional genomic activities in genetic association studies offers robust improvements in both the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits . This limitation is likely due to the models ' inability to account for long-range regulatory patterns , which are crucial for understanding the impact of variants on gene expression and vary across genes . One potential solution is to extend the concept of HFS , applying DL to quantify the genetically determined values of PTMs , protein biochemical properties , and protein and chromosomal structures , potentially employing AlphaFold -derived features . A potential solution could involve developing a new algorithm that bypasses the variant calling stage and directly generates DNA sequences per locus from raw sequencing or SNP array data . In line with these advantages , we showed that HFS-based fine-mapping had high statistical power , and downstream enrichment analysis was capable of revealing biologically interpretable mechanisms . In fact , HFS framework could directly extend to whole-genome sequencing data and capture all mutations as rare as singleton , making one step forward to fill in the 'missing heritability ' . Intriguingly , the majority of Sei 's output is unused in the HFS framework , since Sei predicts over 20 , 000 functional genomic features , while the HFS only represents one of their integrated scores . Therefore , HFS alone can not wholly replace SNP without any loss , as our results demonstrate that the HFS-based prediction model captured approximately 70 % of the variance explainable by the SNP-based prediction model . Intrinsically , HFS captures only the variant effect mediated by functional genomics , while a genetic variant might also influence amino acids , post-transcriptional modifications ( PTMs ) , and 3D chromosomal structures . As a typical example , our findings of enrichment of intelligence-associated loci in arachidonic acid metabolism pathway is in line with the well-known role of polyunsaturated fatty acid in neurodevelopment . Recent studies indicate that DL models , trained on the reference human genome , demonstrate limited accuracy in predicting gene expression levels across different individuals . An example of such data is the EN-TEX dataset , which aligns functional genomic peaks with the specific individuals and haplotypes they correspond to . We suggest that HFS is a promising strategy for future genetic studies , but more progresses in algorithm and computation and data resources are still desired . This approach is far from optimal , as it led to only moderate improvement and did not enhance fine-mapping and biological enrichment analysis . Future development of novel DL models that predict functional genomics in a manner more fitting to the HFS framework could considerably reduce computation costs . Future improvements in DL models ' ability to predict interindividual differences could be achieved by incorporating cross-individual data in the training process . In this study , the transformation phase of the genotype-haplotype sequence for UK Biobank SNP data required hundreds of thousands of CPU core hours . For instance , although sei can not identify the specific gene regulated by a given input sequence , it can predict changes in the sequence 's functional activity . Thus , HFS could capture information from rare variants overlooked by classic association study and improve polygenic prediction , as shown by our result . The challenge of using sequence-based DL models in HFS applications is further compounded by their difficulty in predicting variations between individuals
[METHODS] ",,895,93,None,"The human genome contains a large number of genetic variants , which can affect how many genes are in a gene . These variants can also affect how well a particular gene is expressed , or how well the gene is regulated . This information is then used to predict the genetic basis of a trait , such as how well an individual is able to develop a new disease . However , it is not clear exactly how these variants affect how much genes are involved in the disease , and how they affect the disease itself . In order to understand how genes are affected , researchers need to know how many variants are present in the genome . To do this , they use a method called the Haplotype Function Score ( HFS ) . The HFS score is a measure of how well each gene is affected by a variant . It can be used to identify which genes are responsible for the disease and to predict how well genes are regulated in the body . For example , if a single gene is found in the human genome , the HFS will predict how many mutations are in that gene , but not how many are in the same gene in the individual . Using a technique called least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO ) regression , Wang et al . used a deep learning model to predict which genes were affected by the variants in the genetic background . They found that HFS was more accurate than SNP-based analysis , with a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared to SNP -based analyses .

[ABSTRACT] The current study assessed whether three different types of 3 months mental Training Modules geared towards nurturing ( a ) attention-based mindfulness , ( b ) socio-affective , or ( c ) socio-cognitive skills may impact hippocampal organization by reducing stress . We observed increases in bilateral cornu ammonis volume ( CA1-3 ) following the 3 months compassion-based module targeting socio-affective skills ( Affect module ) , as compared to socio-cognitive skills ( Perspective module ) or a waitlist cohort with no training intervention . We evaluated mental training-induced changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity , by combining longitudinal structural and resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis in 332 healthy adults . Structural changes were paralleled by relative increases in functional connectivity of CA1-3 when fostering socio-affective as compared to socio-cognitive skills . Notably , using a multivariate approach , we found that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels . Overall , we provide a link between a socio-emotional behavioural intervention , changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function , and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults . The hippocampus is a central modulator of the HPA-axis , impacting the regulation of stress on brain structure , function , and behavior . Furthermore , training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output . We related these changes to changes in diurnal and chronic cortisol levels .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Thus , we can not at this point derive a consistent pattern of how mental training influences different indices of cortisol activity , yet we do find a consistent change in CA1-3 following Affect training , and observe domain-general patterns of change associations between CA1-3 and cortisol markers , indicating CA1-3 may play a central role within the context of Affect training and diurnal stress reduction based on univariate analysis . In the current cohort , we could demonstrate widespread patterns of hippocampal functional connectivity to mesiotemporal , lateral temporal , together with anterior as well as posterior midline regions , lateral temporo-parietal , and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices - a pattern in excellent accordance to previous studies probing hippocampal functional connectivity at rest in healthy populations , and outlining 'mesiotemporal ' components of default-mode networks . Future work , studying the hippocampal surface at higher granularity , for example though unfolding the hippocampal sheet , may further help with both alignment and identification of not only subfield-specific change but also alterations as a function of the hippocampal long axis , a key dimension of hippocampal structural and functional variation that was not assessed in the current work . It is of note that non-adherence to saliva sampling in ambulatory settings has been shown to exert a significant impact on the resulting cortisol data and that the present data does not fully conform to the recently provided consensus guidelines on the assessment of the CAR , which were published after the conception of our study . We find that only the 3 months Affect training module cultivating compassion and care , rather than attention-based ( Presence ) or socio-cognitive ( Perspective ) training , related to an increase of hippocampal CA1-3 subfield volume , with corresponding alterations in functional connectivity and a reduction in total diurnal cortisol output . Although we observed that CA1-3 volume was selectively increased by socio-affective mental training at the group level , and that individual differences in CA1-3 volume increase within the Affect module correlated with reduced diurnal cortisol release , the pattern linking bilateral CA1-3 volume increases with reduced diurnal cortisol release was also present when all modules were combined . Next to demonstrating a consistent relationship between total daily cortisol output and hippocampal structure , the absence of univariate findings for cortisol awakening response ( CAR ) , diurnal slope or hair cortisone levels may a divergence in the sensitivity of alternative cortisol-based stress markers to structural neuroimaging markers . Although the univariate examination of changes specific to modules in volume and connections within the Affect Module presents how changes in cortisol align with group-level rises in CA1-3 volume , the multivariate analysis extended this observation through considering individual-level alterations not discernible at the group level through a data-driven method . When comparing the differential efficiency of the 3 months mental Training Modules Presence , Affect , and Perspective against each other and a retest-control group on hippocampal subfield structure , we observed consistent increases in bilateral CA1-3 volume following socio-emotional Affect training relative to socio-cognitive Perspective training and no training in retest controls . Evaluating training-related changes in diurnal cortisol output ( cortisol awakening response , total diurnal output and diurnal slope ) , we observed that bilateral CA1-3 volume increases correlated with decreases in total diurnal cortisol output ( assessed as the area under the curve with respect to ground , AUCg , sampled on 10 occasions over two consecutive days ) . Combined , outcomes of our univariate and multivariate analyses point to an association between change in hippocampal subfields and stress markers , and that these changes , at the level of the individual , ultimately reflect complex interactions within and across hippocampal subfields and may capture different aspects of diurnal stress . While the experimental nature of our

It is also responsible for controlling how much time we spend in the day , and for how long we spend on our daily activities . The brain is made up of a number of different regions , including the central , temporal and spatial regions . These regions are called subfields , which are shaped like a sheet of tissue . This layer of tissue is known as the cortex . However , it is not clear how this layer is formed . To understand how the brain works , researchers have developed a series of mental training modules that focus on improving the structure and function of the hippocampal area . One of these modules , called the Affect module , involves a group of people who are trained to be more compassionate . In this module they are taught how to be kind to one another , how to interact with one another and how to communicate with each other . During the module a person is asked to take part in a conversation about something , such as a story . When the participants are asked to do this , they are shown how their brains work together . For example , when the participants were given a meal , the volunteers were shown how they were able to relax themselves . As a result , a decrease in the amount of cortisol in the body was observed . Another module aimed at improving the size of the brain called the Cornu Ammonis subfield was shown to increase the amount and size of cornu ammonis . Finally , after the module was completed , participants were shown to be less stressed . Overall , this study provides a link between a mental training module and a reduction in cortissol levels"

[ABSTRACT] However , it is unclear what fraction of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect , and whether the loci within an inversion could still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect . This shows that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation , at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion . While a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation , most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific , indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species . We find evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments , which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species . Because segregating inversions suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of LD between locally adapted loci , they are also commonly found to be associated with adaptive divergence . Here , we use genome-wide association studies to explore patterns of local adaptation in three species of sunflower : Helianthus annuus , Helianthus argophyllus , and Helianthus petiolaris , which each harbour a large number of species-specific inversions . Local adaptation commonly involves alleles of large effect , which experience fitness advantages when in positive linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Some of the 'usual suspects ' show up in the set of significantly repeated loci identified by PicMin : in addition to the homologs of the FT ( FLOWERING LOCUS T ) gene reported by Todesco et al. , 2020 , we also found hits for several other genes involved in circadian regulation and flowering time , including PRR3 , TOE1 , and PHYC , which is known to regulate photoperiodic responses in Arabidopsis accessions . This assumes that most loci in the genome are not involved in local adaptation , so that the relatively small proportion that are driving adaptation can therefore be picked out due to their tendency to fall into the tail of the distribution of association statistics in at least one other species ( which would only occur at the rate of random chance under a purely neutral model ) . Taken together , these results suggest that some fraction of the genome contributes to adaptation with low redundancy and high repeatability ( which tends to be enriched within genomic regions where there exist inversions in at least one species ) , while the remainder of the adaptive response is driven by loci with high redundancy and species-specific contributions . Theoretical models of adaptive evolution necessarily involve simplified representations of genetics : population genetic approaches explore cases where strong selection deterministically drives a change in allele frequency at one or a few loci ( usually without epistasis ) , whereas quantitative genetic approaches make the infinitesimal assumption that phenotypic change can be realized through small frequency changes at many loci . Future work could perhaps resolve this question using multi-generational crossing designs to break up the LD that tends to accompany local adaptation , allowing a more accurate parsing of the effect sizes of genomic regions and the contribution by repeated vs. redundant components of adaptive trait variation . This could perhaps be quantified explicitly by decomposing heritabilities for traits driving local adaptation , as has been done for standing variation in humans , but this would require a considerable increase in sample size as methods such as GCTA do not yield accurate estimates at the sample sizes used here . While this approach should be relatively robust for identifying loci with repeated patterns of adaptation , there is no way to formally estimate significance of associations found in only a single species , many of which may be false positives due to covariation of population structure and environment . This also highlights how comparative studies of a species lacking an inversion may help identify which genes are driving adaptation in another species with an inversion , as segregating inversions tend to have extensive LD that prevents identification of any potential targets of natural selection within them . Given the difficulty of rigorously quantifying the contribution of alleles of small effect and loci contributing to local adaptation in only one species , it remains an open question what proportion of adaptive response is governed by loci with dynamical behaviour that follow the infinitesimal assumption . Taken together , this suggests that local adaptation in these species is highly flexible - different species apparently use quite different sets of loci to adapt to the same environment - yet still involves some component that has minimal redundancy , with inversions playing a particularly important role . It should be noted that the reduced importance of soil variables in the SIPEC index might be partly driven by the fact that all traits were measured on above-ground features due to the difficulty of getting non-disruptive phenotypic measurements for roots . While it is difficult to preclude this from our analysis , regions of the genome with signatures of repeated association do not tend to have higher levels of shared standing variation than background regions ( Appendix 1-figure 6 ) , suggesting that
[METHODS] ",,905,94,None,"In many organisms , the genetic material that makes up a genome is made up of a large number of genes . These genes are known as alleles of large effect , which are found in many different species of plants and animals . However , it is not clear how many of these genes are involved in adaptation . One way to find out is to look at the genomes of several different species , and then compare them to each other . This allows researchers to see how many genes are associated with different traits . For example , if one gene is associated with a particular trait , then it can be found in a group of genes that are similar to that of another gene . Then , they can look at how many different genes are linked to that trait . If one gene has a lot of effect on a trait – such as a gene called Helianthus argophyllus – then it is likely that some of the genes that make up the adaptive response are also linked to the same trait — such as the genes in the genes of the same species . It is not known how much of the genetic information in the genome contributes to adaptation , but it is known that some genes are more likely to be involved in local adaptation than others .

[ABSTRACT] We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue , and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility . Epithelial expression variance of gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age , and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells . Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages , whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1 . In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression , we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity . Mammary luminal epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers . Effects from aging in single cells are heterogenous , whereas at the organ- and tissue-levels aging phenotypes tend to appear as stereotypical changes . Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers . A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype . The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages : luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells . We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger < 30 ( y ) ears old and older > 55 y women . We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We also demonstrate how increased molecular noise during aging may lead to significant variances in the transcriptomes between aged individuals and propose that this mechanism could underlie differences in susceptibility to development of breast cancers , particularly luminal breast cancer subtypes . Because cancer susceptibility indicates a state that could be more easily pushed towards cancer initiation , we can consider the variances between aged individuals to occupy multiple metastable states , some of which represent susceptible phenotypes that can be perturbed towards development of specific cancers . Age-dependent directional and variant changes in LEPs even shape the tissue-level expression of predictive biomarkers that classify normal tissue and breast cancer subtypes , illustrating how age-dependent dysregulation in LEPs may play a key role in tissue transformation into frank cancers . Therefore , the degree to which breast-cancer associated genes are variably expressed across the different cell populations of the breast and across different individuals may explain why breast cancers develop in only a subset of women in a subtype-specific manner . We show that increased variances in the transcriptomic profiles of mammary epithelial lineages across individuals is a significant outcome of the aging process and is likely central to our understanding of the increased susceptibility to breast cancers with age . Strikingly , LEPs can integrate age-dependent signals from MEPs and almost exclusively exhibit the stereotyped , directional changes seen in aging epithelia that comprise a prominent signal detected in bulk tissue . We speculate that these variance-driven changes are examples of age-dependent priming events that push epithelial cells towards metastable states susceptible to malignant transformation . Our studies show how directional and variant responses that contribute to aging biology are integrated in breast tissue of older women .

Mammary epithelae are a group of cells that are found in the breast , and they are often referred to as “mammary luminal cells” because they are the cells that make up the breast’s surface .

[ABSTRACT] Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of Thlaspi arvense , a rising crop and model species , and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads , usually discarded , can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions . We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress ( Thlaspi arvense ) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids , mildew , and other microbes . We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations , had significant SNP-based heritability , and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents . Moreover , we found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads , in particular differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure , likely induced by pathogens . Understanding the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance is an important goal in plant science , but it usually requires large and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments . Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load . Here , we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions . Specifically , pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats , presumably less favorable to aphids , showed higher aphid DNA load , i. e. , decreased aphid resistance . With rapidly increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide , this approach should have broad application in fundamental and applied research .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] As we expected the observed climate-associated variation in pest loads to be at least partially explained by variation in chemical defenses , and since in A. thaliana glucosinolates , the main defensive compounds , are known to be geographically structured in response to aphid distributions , we also tested for association of aphid and mildew loads with glucosinolates in our collection . It also provides a proof of principle that exogenous reads from large sequencing efforts , usually discarded if not mapping to the target genome , can be leveraged to extract additional information about important biotic interactions of the target species , including its antagonists and microbiome components . These findings suggest that glucosinolate composition , rather than total amount , is important for aphid defense , and that while benzyl glucosinolate might have a deterrent effect , sinigrin might on the contrary attract M. persicae or act as a stimulant , which would be in accordance with previous observations . For both M. persicae and Erysiphales , the majority of DMRs were hypomethylated in affected samples , which is in accordance with the loss of methylation observed in A. thaliana and T. arvense upon aphid feeding , and in diploid wheat upon powdery mildew infection , but we also detected hypermethylation at several loci . As expected , aphid counts were negatively correlated with temperature of origin ( particularly minimum temperature ) , and positively with temperature variability ( mean diurnal range and temperature annual range ) ( Figure 3A ) , suggesting that plants from colder and more thermally fluctuating climates , which are less favorable to aphids , were less well defended and performed worse in our glasshouse . MLP165 , the closest gene to the most significant variant in the peak , is indirectly involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis in A. thaliana ( The Arabidopsis Information Resource ( TAIR ) , 2000 ) , which might explain why baseline glucosinolate levels were associated with Erysiphales load ( Figure 3B ) . We demonstrated the importance of removing ambiguous reads prior to variant calling , as this prevented calling false positive variants caused by exogenous DNA that also mapped to highly conserved or repetitive sequences in the T. arvense genome . Overall , we found associations between pathogen load and TE methylation that could potentially act both in cis ( e. g. Copia TE methylation in MAPKKK20 promoter ) and in trans , e. g. , through transposon reactivation ( e. g. LINE , Helitron , and Ty3/Gypsi TEs isolated from genes ) . We combined this approach with data from a common environment experiment to show that pest and microbiome load were geographically structured , as expected from locally adapted traits , and associated with both genetic and DNA methylation variants . For Erysiphales load , however , there were several significant associations neighboring genes directly involved in defense , mostly members of the MLP family , clustered in a large peak on the first arm of Scaffold 1 ( Figure 3E ) . In summary , our study offers first insights into the defense mechanisms of T. arvense , including candidate genes and alleles which may be of interest for breeding efforts in this novel biofuel and cover crop . Here , we describe how an unplanned pest infestation in a glasshouse experiment , together with available WGS data , can be used to estimate aphid , mildew , and microbial loads , and thus variation in plant resistance . Since stomatal closure is a known defense mechanism to block pathogen access , it is tempting to conclude that hypomethylation of the MAPKKK20 promoter might induce its overexpression and consequent stomatal closure , thereby

However , plants can also survive in environments where they are exposed to different types of pests , such as aphids and mildew . One way to understand how plants respond to pests is to look at the genomes of the plants they grow in . The genomes that are sequenced in the plant are then compared to those of other plants . This allows researchers to better understand how the plants are able to defend themselves against pests and other microbes . For example , if a plant is growing in an area where it is less likely to be attacked by a pest , it might be more likely to have more pests than it does . To do this , researchers need to know how the plant’s genome is organized , how it is protected from a particular type of pest and how it can be used to protect itself . In this study , the researchers used a technique called whole-genome sequencing ( or X-ray crystallography ) to study the genetics of 207 natural lines of field pennycress , which were grown in varying climates and adapted to the environment .

[ABSTRACT] In six selections with TCMDC-125334 , the most common mechanism of resistance to this compound was copy number variation of the dhodh locus , although we did identify one mutation , DHODH I263S , which conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265 . Finally , we tested whether collateral sensitivity could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of combination treatment by exposing wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously . We focus on one compound , TCMDC-125334 , which was active against all mutant lines tested , including the DHODH C276Y line , which arose in selections with the clinical candidate DSM265 . Drug combinations based on collateral sensitivity , wherein resistance to one drug causes increased sensitivity to the partner drug , have been proposed as an evolutionary strategy to suppress the emergence of resistance in pathogen populations . This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation which were cross-resistant to both compounds and were as fit as the wildtype parent in vitro . Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to malaria control and eradication efforts , necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat this disease . We found that selection of the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334 yielded additional genetic changes in the dhodh locus . We profiled the cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHODH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHODH inhibitors . These double mutant parasites exhibited decreased sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 and were highly resistant to DSM265 . In this study , we explore collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ) . The emergence of these cross-resistant , evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our finding that sequentially treating the DHODH C276Y line with a second inhibitor led to the acquisition of additional genetic changes , rather than reversion back to wildtype , has important implications for treatment strategies to manage resistance . The major take-away of this study is that combination treatment with DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 failed to suppress resistance , and we hypothesize that this is due to the great diversity of evolutionarily competitive dhodh mutations that confer resistance to various inhibitors . We can not quantify the frequency of resistance emergence based on our results , which would be necessary to fully understand the risk of resistance to DSM265 + TCMDC-125334 in combination compared to treating with either compound alone . Similarly , we find that although most of the mutations we originally identified were collaterally sensitive to TCMDC-125334 , repeated treatment with DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 in combination ultimately yielded the cross-resistant variant DHODH V532A . We found that sequentially treating a collaterally sensitive mutant line with TCMDC-125334 selected for parasites with additional genetic changes in dhodh , including the DHODH F227Y mutation , which alone also confers resistance to TCMDC-125334 . It will be important to test potential combination strategies in vivo , as pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may impact how multiple drugs interact with each other , with implications for the emergence of resistance . The main conclusion of our study is that combining two DHODH inhibitors , DSM265 and TCDC-125334 , based on their collateral sensitivity profiles fails to prevent the emergence of resistance in P. falciparum in vitro . Our results demonstrate that this pocket not only accommodates the binding of a variety of chemical structures , but is also very mutationally flexible , highlighting the resistance liability of this enzyme as a drug target . This result is in contrast with our previous work , in which selecting DHODH E182D parasites with the mutant-type inhibitor IDI-6273 caused parasites to revert back to the wildtype amino acid sequence . One implication of these results is that targeting this enzyme with antimalarial drugs has a high risk of resistance emergence and brings into question the usefulness of pursuing further DHODH inhibitors . In the context of collateral sensitivity , the study from Barbosa et al. , 2019 also indicates that re-sensitization to wildtype is favored when there is negative epistasis between resistance mechanisms . Although all previously identified mutations that we tested exhibited sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 , we identified the point mutation DHODH I263S in selection with TCMDC-125334 alone , which was resistant to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265 . Our work has implications for strategies such as drug cycling or the simultaneous use of multiple first-line treatments that aim to delay the emergence of resistance . Interestingly , we also observed that the DHODH E182D parasite had a competitive fitness defect , while we previously showed that the DHODH C276Y is as fit as wildtype in in vitro competitive growth assays . Molecular simulation points to differential binding affinity of TCMDC-125334 to the wildtype and C276Y mutant proteins , consistent with the increased sensitivity of the mutant observed in our study ( Figure 5 ) . Additionally , we have previously conducted allelic replacements with mutations in DHODH which have phenocopied the selected lines , suggesting that these mutations are the primary driver of the observed resistance phenotypes . However , we did find that the DHODH V532A mutation conferring cross-resistance to both compounds emerged from a population of 108 parasites after three treatment cycles . While we identified three point mutations in this study that confer resistance to TCMDC-125334 , the majority of dhodh mutations tested thus far are sensitive to this molecule
[METHODS] ",,937,95,None,"Plasmodium falciparum is a parasite that causes malaria . The parasites infected with this parasite are resistant to the drug DSM265 . However , resistance to the drugs has been linked to a number of other diseases , including cancer , diabetes , and heart disease . In addition , the parasite can also develop resistance to other drugs , such as antibiotics , which are available in the market . This is because resistance to one drug can lead to the development of resistance to another , or even to the emergence of resistance . One way to overcome resistance is to combine two drugs . For example , a drug called TCMDC-125334 can be used to treat malaria , but it is not known how this combination works . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called genetic profiling to study the effects of two drugs on malaria parasite cells . Using a microscope , they found that the mutant parasite had a mutation in the gene for DHODH . These mutations were found in a group of mutant parasitic cells , called the C276Y line , that was resistant to both drugs and was more sensitive to the two drugs than the wildtype parasite . When the mutants were exposed to both compounds , their genetic changes were more likely to be present . Wang also found that combining two drugs with one drug could help to prevent resistance to dhodh . Further experiments showed that the mutations in the C 276Y lines were more common than the mutant lines , suggesting that the combination of drugs could be used as a strategy to control resistance to drugs based on collateral sensitivity .

[ABSTRACT] To address this , we developed a novel compartmental model that tracks sensitive and resistant parasite strains , as well as the host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity . Existing models on resistance evolution lack consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance , possibly due to overlooking the feedback between antigenic diversity , host immunity , and selection for resistance . Our results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency , regardless of resistance cost or efficacy . Though most infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa , resistant strains often emerge in low-transmission regions . Our study underscores the critical role of malaria strain diversity in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution . The establishment and spread of antimalarial drug resistance vary drastically across different biogeographic regions . Post discontinuation of drugs , resistance remains high in low-diversity , low-transmission regions , while it steadily decreases in high-diversity , high-transmission regions . Validation using chloroquine-resistant marker data supports this trend .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] However , in these models , the infectivity of new bites constrained by antigen diversity is not considered such that under high transmission the clinically immune class still receives numerous new infections , and the lowered symptomatic rate does not offset the amount of drug treatment due to new infections , giving rise to the increasing resistance prevalence at the high end of transmission potential . In our model , we argue that despite the MOI within each G class being Poisson distributed , the population-level MOI distribution is over-dispersed as hosts in the G2 class are much less likely to be infected than in G1 or G0 ( Figure 2-figure supplement 2 ) and hosts in drug-treated classes have lower MOI than untreated classes as they harbor mostly resistant parasites only . In addition , an equal cost in mixed- vs. single-genotype infections also produced a lower frequency of resistance at high transmission in the full model , but not in the GI-only model , indicating that within-host competition will exacerbate the disadvantage of resistant parasites under high transmission , but does not generate the negative correlation . In these regions , elimination of falciparum malaria through vector control measures could proceed with little effect on drug resistance levels , whereas continual drug treatment will almost certainly cause fixation or near-fixation of resistance for a prolonged period of time , even after discontinuation of one drug . While past models have examined the frequency of drug resistance as a consequence of transmission intensity and generalized immunity , these models , unlike ours , failed to reproduce the observed patterns of monotonic decreasing trend of resistance frequency with prevalence despite varying resistance costs , access to treatments , or resistance efficacy . Therefore , when the host population suffers a high parasite prevalence , most hosts have experienced many infections and have entered the clinically immune class , where the drastically reduced infectivity coupled with the reduced symptomatic rate result in an overall reduced drug treatment per infection , mitigating the advantage of resistance . In contrast , in high-prevalence regions such as sub-Saharan Africa , measures of prompt switching between first-line drugs and combination therapies will be quite robust against rapid increases and prolonged maintenance of drug resistance . For example , when a fixed fraction of hosts is assumed to be drug-treated upon infection , the frequency of resistance is found to be unrelated to transmission intensity or requires other mechanisms to explain why resistance is prevalent in low-transmission regions . It is also to be noted that the trend found in our model predicts an equilibrium state of resistance frequency under persistent drug usage , which can not be extrapolated to transient dynamics of new drug introduction . Thus , in our model resistant strains reach fixation or near-fixation regardless of the actual transmission potential , and upon removal of the drug pressure , these regions continue to maintain high levels of drug resistance for a prolonged time . The inclusion of strain diversity in the model provides a new mechanistic explanation as to why Southeast Asia has persisting resistance to certain antimalarial drugs , including chloroquine , despite a lower transmission intensity than Africa . In contrast , high-diversity regions ( e. g. , Africa ) should show a wide range of resistance frequency depending on how antigenic diversity is matched with local vectorial capacities and should respond more rapidly to changing drug pressures . Therefore , we focused on empirical comparison to Pfcrt 76T because this mutation is essential for chloroquine resistance and chloroquine has been heavily used as first-line drugs for years in most countries . In contrast , in our model the selective pressure from drug treatment not only depends on the host ratio in the clinically immune class , but also on the infectivity of new bites regulated by specific immune memory . However , we did not find that the higher cost in mixed-genotype infections influenced the qualitative pattern of a negative relationship between transmission intensity ( represented
[METHODS] ",,872,92,None,"Many malaria parasites are transmitted by mosquitoes to humans , and they can cause serious health problems if left untreated . However , the number of infections caused by malaria is still high in sub-Saharan Africa , which is where most of the malaria cases occur . This is because malaria is transmitted to humans by mosquito bites . In some areas , malaria can be transmitted to other people by the mosquito , while in others , it can be spread to other animals . The parasite that causes malaria is known as falciparum . It is a parasite with a unique ability to transmit malaria to other humans . Most malaria infections are caused by the bite of a mosquito . But , in some cases , this parasite is transmitted from one mosquito bite to another . To control malaria , mosquito bite victims must be treated with drugs that are safe and effective for the parasite to transmit . Currently , there are no drugs available to treat malaria . Instead , new drugs are being developed that can treat malaria more effectively . One way to find out why malaria is so resistant is to look at how many mosquito bite types are present in a population . For example , if a person is infected with fewer than one mosquito type , they are more likely to be inflicted with malaria if they are infeasible to get rid of the mosquito bite . Now , Wang et al . have developed a new model that tracks the spread of malaria in different biogeographic regions . These regions are characterized by high levels of resistance , but low levels , even when they are not able to transmit the malaria worm . They show a negative correlation between the frequency of resistance and the frequency , regardless of the cost of the drug ."

[ABSTRACT] A memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile . Here , we leverage a stepwise in vitro differentiation system that captures the early embryonic developmental cascade to investigate the impact of exposure to the most abundant phytocannabinoid , Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ) . We demonstrate that Δ9-THC increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) but not of their primed counterpart . However , while cannabinoid receptors are expressed in the early embryo , the impact of phytocannabinoids exposure on early embryonic processes is lacking . These results represent the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development . Surprisingly , this increased proliferation , dependent on the CB1 receptor binding , is only associated with moderate transcriptomic changes . Instead , Δ9-THC capitalizes on ESCs ' metabolic bivalence by increasing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities . Cannabis , the most consumed illicit psychoactive drug in the world , is increasingly used by pregnant women .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Bioenergetics analyses and metabolite measurements showed that this increased glucose metabolism did not support increased energy production in the mitochondria , but rather , that it led to the accumulation of metabolic intermediates used in anabolic reactions for the synthesis of amino acids , nucleotides , and lipids . Comparing the outputs of the metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses ( i. e. PCA plots and volcano plots ) , the impact of Δ9-THC at these early stages seems to be primarily metabolic , although the moderate effects on the transcriptome appear to support the metabolic outcome as revealed by our integrated analysis ( Figure 5F ) . In particular , exposure to Δ9-THC increased ESC proliferation which was in a similar range to what has been previously reported for human breast carcinoma cell lines ( about 30-50 % between 10 nM and 1 µM of Δ9-THC ) . Using a well-characterized in vitro model of early embryonic differentiation events culminating in the differentiation of PGCLCs , our study is the first to shed light on the impact of Δ9-THC at these stages which unfold during the first trimester in humans . Thus , the metabolic signatures associated with Δ9-THC exposure are reminiscent of those inherently occurring during naïve-to-prime transition , during which increased aerobic glycolytic rates feed anabolic reactions ultimately fueling proliferation . In EpiLCs , the impact of Δ9-THC exposure is not sufficient to override the cellular and metabolic programs of these already highly proliferative cells that are fully reliant on aerobic glycolysis ( Figure 8 ) . We verified this model by testing the requirement of increased glycolysis to support proliferation and indeed observed that ESCs proliferation upon Δ9-THC exposure is abrogated in the presence of the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG . In vitro models for germ cell development offer a unique opportunity for such studies and our work in mouse PGCLCs identifies metabolites as relevant carriers of information across developmental stages . Together , we propose that Δ9-THC exposure elicits a reprogramming of ESCs that ( 1 ) coaxes them to rely more on aerobic glycolysis , ( 2 ) drives anabolic pathways , and therefore ( 3 ) leads to their proliferation . While in vitro gametogenesis , up to the reconstitution of fully functional spermatozoa and oocytes , is a reality in mouse , transposition to humans has been hindered by ethical and technical considerations . During the development of the central nervous system , perinatal Δ9-THC exposure has also been associated with alteration in cell adhesion , with an impact on neuronal interactions and morphology . However , our experiments demonstrated that despite being required for Δ9-THC-induced proliferation in ESCs , CB1 expression did not significantly differ at the surface of ESCs and EpiLCs . Because Δ9-THC is a known perturbator of mitochondrial function as previously described in the central nervous system , we studied the metabolic impact of its exposure in ESCs and EpiLCs . Despite epidemiological evidence of cannabis exposure in parents being associated with adverse effects in the offspring , the molecular mechanisms involved in the inheritance of exposure have not been extensively studied . Functional annotation further indicated that these downregulated genes are related to structural cellular components , to the interaction with the extracellular environment and , specifically , to cell adhesion and junction . Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the metabolic reprogramming induced by Δ9-THC exposure in ESCs was transcriptionally encoded , with increased expression of genes involved in anabolic pathways . In particular , despite proliferation and a higher number of cells , the number of DEGs that were downregulated in PGCLCs deriving from Δ9-THC-exposed ESCs and EpiLCs suggests a general degradation of PGCLCs ' homeostasis . Our work also highlights the importance of the metabolic remodelling induced by Δ9-THC and its potential role as a driver of exposure memory through differentiation stages . Cell-cell adhesion is crucial in PGCs ' formation both in cell culture systems as well as in vivo where it

Wang also found that , in the absence of direct exposure , this increased proliferation was only associated with moderate changes in the transcriptome . Moreover , these changes were not associated with the expression of the CB1 receptor , an important regulator of ESC proliferation . Further experiments showed that exposure to 6-THCD increased the proliferation rate of 10 nm , but not the growth rate of the ESC .

[ABSTRACT] In contrast to the massive variability of gene copies , nucleotide diversity in zebrafish NLR genes is very low : around half of the copies are monomorphic and the remaining ones have very few polymorphisms , likely a signature of purifying selection . By sequencing 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations , we identified a total of 1513 NLRs , many more than the previously known 400 . Copy number variation in large gene families is well characterized for plant resistance genes , but similar studies are rare in animals . Approximately half of those are present in all wild populations , but only 4 % were found in 80 % or more of the individual fish . Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population than laboratory strains . The zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) has hundreds of NLR immune genes , making this species ideal for studying this phenomenon .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Since our targeted sequencing approach does not elucidate the genomic arrangement of the NLR gene copies and many of them do not have recognizable orthologs in the reference genome , we can not draw further conclusions about the role of tandem arrays in their evolutionary trajectory . Since there are many transposable elements on the long arm of chromosome 4 , it would be reasonable to assume that at least some of them have assisted in the local expansion and transfer of NLR exons and genes to chromosomes other than chromosome 4 . It is possible that some of them participate in the formation and activity of inflammasomes , but we only found the N-terminal effector domains ( CARD or PYD ) that are typically involved in this function in a small subset of NLR-C genes . If the diversity of unrelated NLR genes in such distantly related species is driven by common molecular mechanisms , then the same mechanisms might also act on NLRs of other phylogenetic clades and even on unrelated large gene families , such as odorant receptors . In wild zebrafish , we found a set of 880 NLR genes which were detected in at least one individual from three wild populations , but only 58 NLRs were found in the vast majority ( more than 80 % ) of wild individuals . The sheer amount of copy number variation that appears to be present in a single gene family of zebrafish is staggering , with different individuals each having numerous genes that are not present in all others . In the similarly evolving plant NLRs , tandem duplication is thought to be the primary driver of NLR gene expansion , but they are also often associated with transposable elements . In general , the fact that hundreds of NLR gene copies are maintained in zebrafish , together with a signature of purifying selection , suggests that the evolution of these genes is far from neutral . There are at least two mechanisms which could contribute to the extensive copy number variation seen among zebrafish populations : first , it could be attributed to a high degree of haplotypic variation . However , the vast number of NLRs in zebrafish combined with presence/absence variation and high rates of duplication exceeds what has been found in other animals so far . A total of 464 conserved , high-confidence orthogroups were identified in A. thaliana , 106-143 of which were defined as the core NLRome because they were found in a subset comprising at least 80 % of the accessions . One example of the latter is the MHC locus , which harbors varying numbers of gene copies between closely related species of ruminants and has haplotype-specific copies in mice . In this study , we have laid the groundwork for future studies investigating the molecular basis and evolutionary mechanisms contributing to the diversity of large , vertebrate gene families . We postulate that as immune genes , many NLR genes are likely shared between populations because they provide a fitness advantage in the defense against common pathogens . Studies have shown that even mammals have hundreds of genes with diverse molecular functions that are affected by copy number variation , even though it rarely involves full genes . The reduction in copy number variation in the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) locus in a population of greater prairie-chicken was attributed to a recent bottleneck as well . However , the overall number of gene copies as well as the variation in copy numbers within populations and in individual gene repertoires are more extreme in zebrafish than in A. thaliana . 2 genes in clusters on the long arm of chromosome 4 suggests that tandem duplication via unequal crossing-over played the most important role in the expansion . Such segregating haplotype blocks would explain the existence of the core NLRome , but not the frequent presence of genes that occur only in a single individual . Although structural similarities of NLRs in plants
[METHODS] ",,873,92,None,"The zebrafish is a species of fish that lives in the ocean . It has hundreds of immune genes , which are found in many different species , including mammals , birds , and insects . However , it is not clear how many of these genes are present in all species . The majority of the genes in the zoonotic fish are found on the same chromosomes , but some of them are very similar to each other . This suggests that the zebrelles have a large number of genes that are important for the defense against common pathogens . In addition , many of those genes are also found in other animals , such as humans . One of the main reasons for this is that many of the gene copies in the fish are very small , making them difficult to study in animals . To investigate this phenomenon , Wang et al . used a technique called sequencing to find out how many genes were present in a single zebrian . They used 93 zebecules from a variety of wild and laboratory populations . These samples were then compared to the population of 93 wild and lab-bred fish . Using a combination of sequencing techniques and a computer program , the researchers found that there are more than 400 genes in zebers than in humans , a number of which are not found in humans or other mammals .

[ABSTRACT] It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus , and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with less wings . Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one , two or four wings under the same condition . nov. Each ovule of this taxon possesses three integumentary wings evidently extending outwards , folding inwards along abaxial side and enclosing most part of nucellus . Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal . However , the earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian are rarely known about the dispersal syndrome and usually surrounded by a cupule . From Xinhang , Anhui , China , we now report a new taxon of Famennian ovules , Alasemenia tria gen. et sp . The ovules or seeds ( fertilized ovules ) with wings are widespread and especially important for wind dispersal . The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In early seed plants , the fertile branches terminated by cupulate ovules consistently lack leaves and thus the cupules probably serve a nutritive function as in photosynthetic organs ; this function may be transferred to the integuments of acupulate ovules such as Guazia . The earliest ovules in the Famennian of Late Devonian , usually preserved to be unconnected with branches , are mostly devoid of integumentary wings and enclosed in cupules ; they are thus insufficiently known for integument function and wind dispersal . As in Alasemenia ( Figure 5a ) , the integumentary wings of acupulate ovule of Guazia are broad , thin and fold inwards along the abaxial side , but their numbers are four in each ovule and their free portions usually arch centripetally . Alasemenia , Guazia , and Warsteinia suggest that the evolutionarily novel wings , as integument outgrowths and the most important mechanism for seed dispersal by wind , appeared early in the spermatophytes and had been manifested in younger lineages . Supposing the maximum windward area of each wing is Swing and n represents the number of wings revolving on its own axis , we define a function Sθ to represent the area of windward when the angle between airflow and wings is θ . Compared to Warsteinia with short and straight wings and Guazia with long but distally inwards curving wings , Alasemenia with longer and outwards extending wings would efficiently reduce the rate of descent and be more capably moved by wind . Furthermore , the quantitative analysis in mathematics indicates that three-winged ovules such as Alasemenia are more adapted to wind dispersal than four-winged ovules including Warsteinia and Guazia ( see following ) . The Reynolds number ( Re ) is the indicator of patterns in fluid flow situations , and for ovules , the Reynolds numbers are mainly falling in 103-104 , suggesting that the inertia forces are much stronger than viscous forces . In examining samaras , it has been demonstrated that the value of angular velocity is smaller than that of terminal velocity , and the relationship between the samaras ' wing loading and terminal velocity vter is : vter∝wAw where w is the weight of samaras , AW is the surface area of the wing , w/AW is defined as the samaras ' wing loading . Except few taxa including Guazia , Dorinnotheca , Cosmosperma , Elkinsia and Moresnetia , the earliest ovules in the Late Devonian ( Famennian ) have not been preserved to be connected to the branches . Regarding Alasemenia , the nutritive function would also apply to the integuments since the acupulate ovules are terminal on various orders of naked branches and ultimate axes . The integument of Alasemenia is adnate to most part of the nucellus and its three lobes extend long distance above the nucellar tip and then evidently outwards . Ovules of Alasemenia and Guazia terminating long and narrow branches suggest easy abscission of diaspores ( ovules with or without an ultimate axis ) and better preparation for dispersal . However , the tiny asymmetry of ovules will be amplified in the running geometry by centrifugal and aerodynamic loads , result in vibrations and thus significantly reduce the efficiency . 03 % Generally , the above one- to four-winged seeds are quantitatively analysed for their wind dispersal capability and the results are shown in Figure 6 . In the ovules with even number of wings like Guazia and Warsteinia , the center symmetry structure will lead to stronger resonance than the ovules with odd number of wings ( like Alasemenia ) . In this situation , the thrust of airflow can be represented as : F=cρv2S where c is the coefficient , ρ is the density of air , S is the windward face , v is the velocity of relative movement . 66 % S ( θ ) =sin⁡θSwing∈ [ 0 , Swing ] , D ( θ ) =4Swing , As
[METHODS] ",,881,93,None,"Plants have a variety of ovules , which are a group of small seeds that are shaped like a flower .

Researchers have now identified a species of sperm that lacks wings and is more adapted to wind dispersals . One of the most important features of the famennian is that the spermatophytes are able to produce seeds with wings that can be dispersed by the wind , while the other species , such as Warsteinia and Guazia have wings that fold inwards . It is not known whether the ancestors of the famous ovarian samaras had wings or not . Now , Wang et al . have found that the famendnian sarcomas have wings and are more suited to wind-dispersal . These findings suggest that the Famendnians evolved to produce seed ovaries with wings and that they were adapted for wind dispersion . They also show that the three-winged seeds of Alasemmenia are more likely to be dispersing by wind than the four wings of the same species "

[ABSTRACT] Although standard treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have achieved remarkable success in prolonging patient survival , intolerance , relapse , and TKI resistance remain serious issues for patients with Ph+ leukemia . Collectively , these findings represent an alternative to tyrosine kinase activity for the oncoprotein and leukemogenic cells and generate a rationale of targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia . Moreover , in contrast to in vivo ineffectiveness of PROTAC-based degraders , depletion of RAPSYN expression , or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and , in turn , inhibited tumor formation and growth . Here , we report a new leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia , and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL . Furthermore , SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity , promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression . Consequently , neddylated BCR-ABL enhances the stability by competing its c-CBL-mediated degradation . Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) leukemia is a fatal hematological malignancy .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Therefore , rather than suppressing the entire neddylation system to affect a wide range of proteins , targeted inhibition of substrate-specific NEDD8 E3 ligase , such as RAPSYN , might offer a potential therapeutic opportunity for more elegant anticancer intervention with fewer side effects . In summary , our work has uncovered the pivotal role that RAPSYN exerts its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity in neddylating and stabilizing BCR-ABL in the pathogenesis of Ph+ leukemia and thus delineate it as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia . On the other hand , neddylation is a specific PTM that modifies multiple Lys residues in BCR-ABL , shielding this oncoprotein to compete ubiquitination-mediated degradation , which provides a reasonable explanation on the poor in vivo efficacy of PROTAC-based degraders for BCR-ABL . Although recent studies have greatly advanced our understanding of the regulation of BCR-ABL degradation , most reported modulatory proteins are not ideal for translation to clinical settings because of their pivotal roles in sustaining normal hematological functions . Given the fact that the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of TKI resistance and LIC population in patients with Ph+ leukemia , effective degradation of BCR-ABL is an alternative opportunity for the treatment . In addition , given the fact that neddylation and sumoylation have both shown , as also in the present study , to be capable of antagonizing the ubiquitination of their substrates , the potential self-modification of RAPSYN is likely to promote its own stabilization . Previously , the residue Y86 in RAPSYN was identified as a phosphorylation site by muscle-associated receptor tyrosine kinase ( MuSK ) at the neuromuscular junction endplate , which could enhance the ligase activity of RAPSYN by mediating its self-association . Furthermore , our present results showed that knockdown of RAPSYN significantly increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to saracatinib , implying that a combination of RAPSYN inhibition and TKI treatment can effectively control mutations and LIC-derived TKI resistance in Ph+ leukemia . Differently , we found that SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN at Y336 residue located between its CC and RING domains in Ph+ leukemia cells , suggesting that the phosphorylation of RAPSYN might be kinase or tissue specific . However , the neddylation system works in a substrate- and context-dependent manner , which essentially defines its role in tumorigenesis as anti or pro , particularly relying on the substrate specificity of the NEDD8 E3 ligase . In the present study , we unveiled that SRC-mediated RAPSYN phosphorylation could substantially potentiate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity and enhance its protein stability , once again suggesting the hematological specificity . Aside from the occurrence of RAPSYN in patients with Ph+ leukemia , the present study revealed a fascinating finding that BCR-ABL expression levels were correlated with those of RAPSYN , demonstrating the specificity of RAPSYN-mediated neddylation of BCR-ABL . On the other hand , N88 was predicted to be a N-glycosylation site with the highest score among all putative ones in RAPSYN , implicating that N-glycosylation of RAPSYN could be a prerequisite for normal RAPSYN phosphorylation and activation . Neddylation can either facilitate ubiquitination-dependent degradation of its substrates , such as EGFR and c-SRC , or enhance protein stability in the cases of HuR and TGF-β type II receptor . MLN4924 , a NEDD8-activating E1 enzyme inhibitor , has been shown to inhibit the survival of both wild-type ( WT ) and T315I-BCR-ABL leukemia cells as well as LICs . More importantly , our results shed a light on future investigations that may help to extend to other cancer types for broadening our understanding of RAPSYN 's involvement in hematology and oncology . Thus , it is reasonable to expect that the inhibition of RAPSYN expression could lead to cytotoxicity in Ph+ leukemia with high specificity and marginal side effects . This phenotype was found to be linked to the NEDD8 E3 ligase activity of RAPSYN , which mediated BCR-ABL neddylation to enhance its stability

[ABSTRACT] We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8 , PHAb10 , and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition , while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer . Among them , PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr , while the other three were thermosensitive . Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases ( i. e. lysins ) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development . As a proof-of-concept , five peptidoglycan hydrolases from the Acinetobacter baumannii proteome ( PHAb7-PHAb11 ) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template . Herein , we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening . In conclusion , our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs . The discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes . Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Due to their C-terminal antimicrobial peptides P10-CP and P11-CP , PHAb10 and PHAb11 can penetrate the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria in a self-primed manner , allowing them to enter and cleave peptidoglycan bonds , ultimately leading to osmotic lysis of Gram-negative pathogens , while Gram-positive bacteria are killed mainly through the action of the intrinsic antimicrobial peptides . Over billions of years of coevolution , more than 80 % of bacterial genomes have become populated with at least one prophage , also known as molecular imprints , and which can serve as an untapped arsenal for the discovery of phage-related antimicrobial agents . Structure-based homology analysis revealed that PHAb10 and PHAb11 probably belonged to the T4 lysozyme family and possessed the conserved Glu-Asp-Thr catalytic triad shared by traditional phage lysins and bacterial autolysins , namely Glu17 , Asp26 , and Thr32 of PHAb10 , and Glu52 , Asp61 , and Thr67 of PHAb11 . It is known that T4 lysozyme ( T4L ) from T4 phage completely loses its enzymatical activity after treatment at 75°C for 5 min , but somehow , heat-denatured T4L retains its bactericidal activity because of the amphipathic α-helix region at the C-terminus of the enzyme which contains membrane disturbing activity . Considering the fact that lysins from Gram-negative bacteria usually contain antimicrobial peptide-like regions , in the present work , we report a new strategy to mine active bactericidal peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes through lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-priming screening . Here , we found that PHAb10 had unique temperature-dependent folding-refolding thermodynamic , and structural and biochemical analyses further suggested that PHAb10 undergoes a unique dimer-monomer transition mediated by seven pairs of intermolecular interactions to survive thermal treatment . As a proof-of-concept , we successfully discovered the two peptidoglycan hydrolases PHAb10 and PHAb11 from the proteome of A. baumannii using the PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template , highlighting the utility of this strategy in mining antimicrobial agents from bacterial database . Therefore , there is reason to believe that advances in bacterial culturomics , 'rebooting ' phage genomes in more tractable hosts , and computational biology , may help discover otherwise inaccessible prophages from bacterial genome big data . Bacteriophage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases ( i. e. lysins ) have been investigated as promising alternatives to combat resistant bacteria due to their unique mechanism of action , potent bactericidal activity , low risk of drug resistance development . More importantly , our findings implied that big data , such as bacterial genomes and proteomes , human proteomes , and other metagenomic datasets , could in principle become an encrypted power in the fight against antimicrobial resistance . To the best of our knowledge , few proteins have been demonstrated to have reversible folding-refolding thermodynamics at high temperature , but their mechanisms are unclear , such as HPL118 , HPL511 , and HPLP35 . Unlike T4L , whose monomer crystals have been exhaustively studied , PHAb10 or PHAb11 is a homodimer that retain almost 100 % of their bactericidal activity after heat treatment through a unique dimer-monomer transition . Unlike other Gram-negative lysins that act in an outer membrane permeabilizer-dependent manner , PHAb10 and PHAb11 exhibited intrinsic activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens via different mechanisms of action . However , for Gram-negative bacteria , the effects of phage-derived lysins were often hampered by their outer membranes , which requires more strategies to overcome this additional barrier . Notably , heat treatment converts HEWL to a partially unfolded , enzymatically inactive and more hydrophobic dimeric form , which exhibits an enhanced bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria . Although some engineered lysins ( especially Artilysins , Innolysins , and Lysocins ) have shown promising performance , clinically promising lysins capable of destroying Gram-negative bacteria remain inadequately addressed . The uncontrollable spread and emergence of antimicrobial resistance requires the discovery of new antimicrobial agents with different targets or mechanisms of action than traditional antibiotics . For example , gp36C lysin from bacteriophage ϕKMV , a
[METHODS] ",,883,93,None,"Viruses can infect humans and animals , but they can also infect other animals . Bacteria that live in the environment are known as prophages , and they are responsible for destroying many of the bacteria that cause disease . Prophage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases ( lysins ) are a group of enzymes that are thought to be promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics . However , it is not clear how these enzymes can be used to kill bacteria . One of the most important steps in the discovery of antimicrobial drugs is to identify the enzymes in the proteome of bacteria that are active in the presence of the enzyme . This is done by using a technique known as peptide-primed screening . In this method , a protein called PlyF307 is added to a bacterial proteome and then screened for active peptidic hydrolase enzymes from the bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii . The enzymes are then placed in a cell and analyzed for their activity . These enzymes were found to be highly active and resistant to several different bacteria , including Gram-negative bacteria and viruses . It was also found to have high levels of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and to be safe to use in humans . Using a mouse model , the researchers found that a combination of peptidylic acids and a new enzyme called PHAb10 was able to kill Gram-positive bacteria even after being treated at 100°C for 1 hour . Further experiments showed that PH Ab10 had a unique folding-refolding mechanism that allowed it to form a monomer , while the other three were thermosensitive . Furthermore , two of the three enzymes showed potent bactericidal"

[ABSTRACT] These results provide a comprehensive comparison of the two types of pancreatic cancer symptom trajectories , which in combination can leverage the full potential of the health data and ultimately provide a fuller picture for detection of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer . Chaining symptoms together in trajectories identified two groups of patients with lower median survival ( < 90 days ) following the trajectories 'Cough→Jaundice→Intestinal obstruction ' and 'Pain→Jaundice→Abnormal results of function studies ' . To complement and compare the registry diagnosis codes with deeper clinical data , we used a text mining approach to extract symptoms from free text clinical notes in electronic health records . We used both data sources to generate and compare symptom disease trajectories to uncover temporal patterns of symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis for the same patients . We show that the text mining of the clinical notes was able to complement the registry-based symptoms by capturing more symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis . In this retrospective study , we used symptom and disease codes ( ICD-10 ) from the Danish National Patient Registry ( NPR ) encompassing 6 . For example , 'Blood pressure reading without diagnosis ' , 'Abnormalities of heartbeat ' , and 'Intestinal obstruction ' were not found for the registry-based analysis . 9 million patients from 1994 to 2018 , , of whom 23 , 592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer . Better detection of early symptoms and relevant disease correlations could improve pancreatic cancer prognosis . Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancer types with poor treatment options . The Danish cancer registry included 18 , 523 of these patients .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Furthermore , our study reveals a notable increase in the prevalence of early symptoms within EHRs suggesting the possibility of harnessing the complete potential of health data by incorporating multi-modality symptom trajectories derived from both EHRs and registry-based codes . In this type of trajectory study , we can only assess the association between diseases , but actual causal relationships will need to be validated by other types of studies , such as Mendelian randomization using genetics . Future applications could leverage this knowledge and use AI and advanced text mining techniques to build longitudinal multi-modal trajectories for improved symptom extraction and early prediction of pancreatic cancer in the clinics . For example , more than 2000 patients out of 3078 text-mined pancreatic cancer cases had 'Pain ' according to the free text clinical notes but in the registry , it was less than 500 patients out of the 18 , 523 pancreatic cancer cases . This study showed that deep phenotypical information stored in registry data and free text EHRs can be useful for detecting temporal patterns prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis . A limitation of this study is that our data is strictly hospital contacts , which may result in a set of identified symptoms and diagnoses occurring not at the earliest disease stage . For the text-mined symptom trajectories , we could detect more symptoms prior to the cancer diagnosis than in the registry-based trajectories using the NPR , despite the text-mining cohort being much smaller . We furthermore observed that disease trajectories including several cardiovascular diseases show lower survival , and it has been suggested in previous studies that cardiovascular diseases can play a role in pancreatic cancer prognosis . Additionally , cardiovascular diseases have been indicated as a risk factor for certain other cancers , and contrariwise it is also discussed whether cancer should be included in cardiovascular risk prediction tools . This study uncovered statistically significant disease and symptom trajectories prior to pancreatic cancer that may be further assessed as early risk factors for pancreatic cancer for screening purposes . 'Jaundice ' can in some cases be a symptom of a late-stage cancer and thus poor survival , but in other cases contribute as a clearer cancer symptom compared to the other more generic pancreatic cancer symptoms . This could be because patients in the short survival group ( ≤90 days ) have fewer symptoms detected and thus will not show up in the symptom trajectories . Also , information bias may exist in the coding procedure within NPR and it might not always be trivial to code the correct symptom or diagnosis . A direct comparison between the two data sources can be challenging since registry terms are not coded exactly as in the free text clinical notes . This integrated approach provides a comprehensive representation of the symptomatology , enabling a more accurate assessment of disease trajectories and potentially facilitating early detection and intervention . One example is acute abdomen in the symptom block 'Abdominal and pelvic pain ' , which describes a condition with severe abdominal pain that demands immediate medical attention . A clinical note might contain text that the patient was admitted with severe stomach pain but code it as the ICD-10 code 'R10 . In clinical settings , this could ultimately serve as a guide for better screening procedures and improve the lives of pancreatic cancer patients . From our study , we show that the inclusion of symptoms text-mined from clinical notes largely complemented ICD-10-coded symptoms from the patient registry . The sequence of events that leads up till the pancreatic cancer diagnosis supports that symptoms may appear in a messy and complex order . By including data
[METHODS] ",,929,95,None,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world . It is caused by a mutation in a gene called ICD-10 , which can cause the body to produce a protein called the pancreas . This protein is found in the blood and helps to control blood sugar levels . However , it is not known exactly what causes pancreatic tumors , but it is thought that it could be linked to other diseases , such as heart disease , diabetes , and cancer . The Danish National Patient Registry ( NPR ) is a large database of patients with pancreal cancer , including those with a history of a variety of diseases . In 1994 , the NPR included 18 , 523 patients , of whom 23 , 492 were diagnosed with the disease . Symptoms and disease codes are stored in the health records of all patients . These codes can be used to identify symptoms and disease patterns . For example , if a patient had a cough or a heart attack , they would have been diagnosed with 'Jaundice' , or 'Intestinal obstruction' . But if the patient had an abnormal heartbeat , this would have led to a higher risk of developing the disease and a lower survival . To better understand how the disease is linked to the disease itself , NPR researchers used a technique called text mining to extract symptoms from free text clinical notes in electronic health records . By combining the information from the medical records with the data from the registry , researchers were able to identify more symptoms before the disease was diagnosed . Further experiments showed that the text mining technique could help to identify early symptoms before a disease was detected .

[ABSTRACT] Leveraging individualized detection of single events , we first provide a detailed cross-sectional characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles , slow oscillations , and their coupling in children and adolescents aged 5-6 , 8-11 , and 14-18 years , and an adult sample of 20- to 26-year-olds . To corroborate these findings , we linked personalized measures of fast spindle maturity , which indicate the similarity between the prevailing development-specific and adult-like canonical fast spindles , and slow oscillation maturity , which reflects the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance , with individual slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns . While the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in that it was still nested in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range for the majority of children , the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the adult-like canonical fast spindle range in all four age groups-but notably less precise in children . Taken together , our results suggest that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles actuates precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood . Importantly , we found that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups . Critically , based on this , we then investigated how spindle and slow oscillation maturity substantiate age-related differences in their precise orchestration . However , there is little knowledge on how this well-known coalescence between slow oscillations and sleep spindles develops . 5-1 Hz ) up peak is considered an essential feature of adult non-rapid eye movement sleep .

[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Hence , our findings represent a promising starting point for future research addressing the precise relation between age-related changes in brain structure and function , the emergence of adult-like SO-spindle coupling , and cognitive development across childhood and adolescence . While SOs provide optimal time windows for sleep spindles to arise , it is the ability to generate adult-like , canonical fast spindles that determines coupling strength and precision across child and adolescent development . Given the evidence for its generating role , our results implicate the maturation of specific thalamocortical circuits as the cornerstone of adult-like SO-spindle coupling patterns . Overall , our findings describe a unique relation between fast sleep spindle maturity and the pattern of SO-spindle coupling across childhood , adolescence , and young adulthood .
[METHODS] ",,459,65,Low token utilization (459/1024),"The brain is made up of a series of circuits called synapses . These circuits allow the brain to respond to changes in the environment , such as changes in temperature , or changes in light . The synaptic connections between these circuits are known as sleep spindles , and they are thought to be responsible for a variety of brain functions . However , it is not clear how these synaptical connections form . One way to understand this is to look at how the brain develops over time . In the brain , a sleep cycle begins when the brain is awake . This is known as the “sleep spindle” , which is a type of sleep cycle that occurs when the body is awake and active . It is also known as slow oscillations , because the brain has a tendency to slow down during sleep . But it is unclear how this happens . To investigate this , Wang et al . used a technique called MRI to measure the activity of the sleep spindel . MRI scans of the brain of children and adolescents aged 5–6 , 8–11 , 14–18 years , as well as an adult sample of 20–26-year-olds . They found that the sleep cycle was more precise in children than in adults , but slower in adults than in children . When the brain becomes more precise , the sleep cycles become more precise and faster . As a result , these sleep cycles are more accurate and faster than in older adults . Wang also found that fast sleep cycles were more precise than slow sleep cycles in adults and children , suggesting that the ability to generate adult-like sleep cycles is the cornerstone of adult-type sleep cycles .

[ABSTRACT] Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect which genes are being studied , we find that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies . To promote the investigation of understudied genes , we condense our insights into a tool , find my understudied genes ( FMUG ) , that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits . These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput technologies , which routinely identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease . Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results . Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of genes as research targets have been proposed , their explanatory powers have not yet been compared . Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 . We demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging . Conversely , we find that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations . Understudied genes remain abandoned by studies that cite these -omics experiments . FMUG is developed in Flutter and is available for download at fmug . edu as a MacOS/Windows app . amaral . northwestern .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We believe that enabling scientists to consciously engage with bias in research target selection will enable more biomedical researchers to participate in unknomics , to the potential benefit of their own research impact and toward the advancement of our collective understanding of the entire human genome . As our present analysis is correlative , it also is tempting to propose controlled trials where published manuscripts on high-throughput studies randomly report hit genes in the abstract even if not investigated further by the authors . The insight that understudied genes are lost to titles and abstracts of research articles in a leaky pipeline between genome-wide assays and reporting of results , and FMUG , have already been useful in guiding our own unknomics research ( Figure 4B ) . Efforts to address the gaps in detailed knowledge about most genes have crystallized as initiatives promoting the investigation of understudied sets of genes , an approach to gene scholarship recently termed 'unknomics ' . Further , the observed discrepancy between the popularity of hits highlighted by GWAS versus other technologies suggests that some -omics technologies may be more powerful than others for characterizing understudied genes . This possibility merits further research and researchers participating in unknomics should consider the relative strengths of each technology toward providing tractable results for follow-up . This intervention would need to be carefully designed since abstracts are limited in their size .

In this study , researchers used a technique called a “gene-based approach” to identify genes that were not well studied . The approach was based on a method called “find my understudieded genes” , which allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of genes as research targets .

[ABSTRACT] We have established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose , resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) . Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of the ECs in the embryos exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs , proliferating ECs , and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes . Further analysis and experiments validated that reduced foxo1a mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of marcksl1a . Utilizing this model , we observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels , especially intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ) . This study has provided new evidence showing the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms . The excessively branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into tip cells . Nevertheless , the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood . Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides were suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Since excessive angiogenesis is the major pathological feature of DR and nephropathy , our findings are in support of a possible biological mechanism underlying the positive associations between noncaloric monosaccharides and microvascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes , suggesting that the noncaloric monosaccharides might not be suitable for ASB consumption . have observed the hyperbranching of small vessel structures originating from the upper part of ISVs , growing horizontally toward and partially connecting to the neighboring ISVs field , the angiogenic sprouts did not form a more complex structure that was observed in our research . In recent years , positive associations between ASB and cardiovascular disease have been proposed , possibly due to several plausible factors , including the potential impact of ASBs on central nervous system circuits , gut hormone secretion , and gut microbiota . Here , by combining the single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data analysis and experimental validation , we identified the transcription factor Foxo1a , which was significantly downregulated in the embryos treated with high glucose , responsible for the excessive angiogenesis . Taken together , our results suggested that both caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides treatment could lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting the differentiation of quiescent ECs into tip cells through the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway . Surprisingly , no notable abnormalities were observed in the vessels of embryos treated with disaccharides , including lactose , maltose , and sucrose , which is consistent with the previous study stating that intakes of sucrose , lactose , and maltose were not significantly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes . Furthermore , despite the potential conversion of these disaccharides into monosaccharides , the restricted reaction rate may maintain them within a safe concentration range that is not harmful to the vessels in a short period . In this study , we have provided new evidence indicating that the administration of noncaloric monosaccharides leads to significant excessive angiogenesis , suggesting that the excessive angiogenesis may not be only attributed to the caloric properties . Additionally , our result further revealed that Foxo1a exerts its regulatory function during this process by downregulating its target gene marcksl1a , regardless of whether the embryos were treated with D-glucose or L-glucose . For a long time , there has been considerable debate and conflicting opinions regarding how specific sugars affect the development of type 2 diabetes rather than excess calories per se . However , these defects were limited to the disruption of tight junctions and dilation of hyaloid-retinal vessels , without the excessive angiogenesis and vascular blockage observed in PDR and our established model . Based on this model , we observed significant excessive angiogenesis induced by glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides , initiated by activating the quiescent ECs into proliferating tip cells . In this study , we successfully established a new zebrafish model with significant excessive angiogenesis , resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in PDR more closely than previously established models . The findings revealed an increased ratio of tip cells and proliferating ECs , accompanied by the altered expression of various angiogenic genes in the ECs of D-glucose-treated embryos . In conclusion , to investigate the effects of monosaccharides on vascular development , we established a zebrafish model by treating the embryos with high concentrations of monosaccharides . We analyzed single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data of the ECs isolated from D-glucose-treated embryos to gain more insights into it . have described a short-term zebrafish model for diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) induced by high glucose , which exhibited blood vessel defects . This finding implied that the effects induced by monosaccharides can not be attributed to the osmotic pressure of the surrounding medium . The effects of monosaccharides on inducing excessive angiogenesis were then proved to be mediated by the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway . Foxo1 has been validated to be essential for sustaining the quiescence of ECs , with involvement in metabolism regulation . The results have provided novel insights into the roles of noncaloric monosaccharides
[METHODS] ",,882,93,None,"The blood vessels in the body are made up of cells called endothelial cells . These cells are responsible for supplying oxygen and nutrients to the body , and they also help to regulate the flow of blood . However , it is not clear how these cells work . For example , if a person has type 2 diabetes , the blood vessels that carry oxygen to the blood are branched , or if they are enlarged , they may become more vascular . This is because the cells in the endothelium are unable to produce enough oxygen to support the blood vessel . In addition , this can lead to the formation of blood vessels , which can be fatal if left untreated . One of the main causes of diabetes is an excess of sugar in the blood , known as noncaloric monosaccharides . The sugars are found in many foods , including sugar-sweetened beverages , but the effects of these sugars on blood vessels remain poorly understood . To investigate this question , Wei et al . used zebrafish embryos to study the effect of sugar on blood vessel formation in a model of type 2 diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) . Using this model , we identified a protein called marcksl1a that is involved in the process of forming blood vessels by releasing a chemical called a molecule called glucose . When the cells were exposed to high glucose , these cells were able to produce more blood vessels than normal cells , suggesting that the sugars could have a negative effect on blood vascular function . Wei and Wei also found that a gene called foxo1a was downregulated in the embryos exposed to the sugar . Further experiments showed that fox"

[ABSTRACT] Our findings suggest that a shared common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay , together facilitating efficient information organization in WM . Here , participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and later reproduced the full color and location sequences one after another . Daily experiences often involve the processing of multiple sequences , yet storing them challenges the limited capacity of working memory ( WM ) . Second , sequences with consistent trajectories show neural reactivation of common trajectories , and display spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations . First , sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrate improved memory performance and a trajectory correlation between reproduced color and location sequences . To achieve efficient memory storage , relational structures shared by sequences would be leveraged to reorganize and compress information . Crucially , we manipulated the consistency between location and color sequence trajectories . Finally , neural reactivation correlates with WM behavior .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The results also exclude other interpretations , such as motor preparation , eye movements , attentional sampling , sequential rehearsal , etc. , since if that is the case , we would expect a similar neural replay profile for location sequences that are to be serially recalled soon . In the current design , as we specifically manipulate the consistency of spatial trajectory distance between color and location sequences defined in a spatial map , cognitive map might be a more conservative term to frame our findings , although in essence it reflects general schema-based WM reorganization . In this work , we provide behavioral and neural evidence that structure is not only dissociated from content representation , i. e. , factorization coding , but also can be aligned in a spontaneous manner , i. e. , linking structures , which together contribute to efficient representation of memory information . In fact , cognitive map refers to the internal representation of spatial relations in a specific environment , while schematic abstraction denotes a more broad range of circumstances , whereby the gist or structure of multiple environments or episodes can be integrated . The fact that without task requirement , human participants still spontaneously extracted underlying common structure and leveraged it to organize multiple item storage reflects the intelligence of our brain to achieve efficient information coding . Notably , our findings could also be understood in terms of schematic abstraction , which plays pivotal roles in memory formation , such that a congruent schema would facilitate memory retrieval compared to an incongruent condition . We show that color-location trajectory alignment is associated with better memory performance than the misaligned condition , and the memory benefit is attributed to structure-induced constraints on individual items that decrease representational uncertainty . In other words , schema refers to a highly abstract framework of prior knowledge that captures common patterns across related experiences , which does not necessarily occur in a spatial framework as cognitive maps do . Here , we extend the functional role of cognitive map in efficiently organizing information across domains in human WM and reveal compressive encoding and neural replay in facilitating multiple sequence storage . Here , the common structure we manipulated is inspired by the theory of cognitive map , which has argued that reasoning in abstract domains follows similar computational principles as in spatial domains . Not that the trajectory alignment manipulation differs from the Gestalt principles of perceptual organization such as proximity and similarity principles , and it instead reflects a higher-order relationship between maps . Furthermore , color neural replay only appears for the color-location aligned sequence ( AT condition ) but not for the misaligned sequences ( MAT condition ) , implicating that neural replay serves to consolidate sequences that share a common structure . Here , when subjects prepare to recall location sequences ( 'location recall ' ) , neural replay occurs for color sequences but not for location sequences , supporting the spontaneous nature of neural replay , since color features are not task-relevant right now . Meanwhile , previous modeling works also suggest that higher-order structures incorporated in WM would serve as constraints on individual-item representations to reduce representational uncertainty . For example , learning process is accelerated when two different feature maps are aligned , and distance-dependent generalization is observed across two different domains in order to search for correlated rewards . It was first observed in the rodent hippocampus and mainly for spatial navigation , but has recently been found in many higher-level non-spatial tasks in human brains . Here , we investigated whether common structures shared across different feature domains would be spontaneously employed to facilitate memory of multiple sequences and its neural correlates . Finally , our study is also different from recent works on structure learning and generalization , as our task does not involve pre-exposure training or task-related rewards . Therefore , instead of treating individual events as independent information , a more efficient way is to seek the link
[METHODS] ",,871,92,None,"The brain is able to store information in a way that is easy to understand , but it also has the ability to reorganize and compress information . For example , a person can recall a sequence of items with different colors and locations , and then repeat it over and over again . However , it is not clear how this process works . To do this , we need to know how to organize information in the brain , which is a complex process that requires a large number of neurons . In this study , the researchers used a technique called working memory ( WM ) to study how the brain processes information in working memory . The experiments show that WM can be reorganized and compressed by a process called neural replay . This process involves a series of sequences , each of which contains a different color and location . These sequences are stored in the same structure , so that they can be easily recalled . WM is also a form of learning , in which the brain learns to recognize and remember the location of a particular item . Previous work has shown that the brain can reorganise information in this way . Now , Wang et al . have used this technique to study the brain’s ability to store multiple sequences in working memories . They found that the WM process can be improved by reorganising and compressing the information , while the brain also reactivates the trajectories of the sequences that are shared by the same items . Wang also found that a common structure is used to organize the information between different locations . Furthermore , when a group of participants recalls a location , their brain replays the same sequence . Thus , this suggests that the processing of information in human working memory can be more efficient"

[ABSTRACT] We also solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements . The observed unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity of PURA indicated that this protein is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity . In contrast to several other monogenetic disorders , almost all reported mutations in this nucleic acid-binding protein result in the full disease penetrance . It offers an explanation why even conservative mutations across PURA result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome . In this study , we observed that patient mutations across PURA impair its previously reported co-localization with processing bodies . These mutations either destroyed the folding integrity , RNA binding , or dimerization of PURA . Mutations in the human PURA gene cause the neurodevelopmental PURA syndrome .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] To understand how genetic variations causing PUR syndrome affect the subcellular localization of hsPURA , we performed immunofluorescence microscopic analyses in HeLa cells by overexpressing full-length hsPURA as well as disease-causing variants in each of the three PUR repeats , that is K97E , I206F , and F233del . Despite these considerable structural changes , the NMR data also confirmed that the K97E-variant protein remains folded in solution and indicates that PUR domains may be able to partially compensate for mutations by folding promiscuity . Based on the crystal structures of hsPURA III ( Figure 3A ) , we were able to predict folding defects in the C-terminal PUR domain ( hsPUR III ) that are caused by the patient-derived genetic variations F233del and R245P ( Figure 3-figure supplement 4 ) . Our findings suggest that the flexibility and promiscuity of hsPURA domain folding render this protein particularly susceptible to mutations , even when amino-acid substitutions impose only moderate changes to the local charge and stereochemistry . In summary , this study provides the first functional and experimental structural assessment of the effects of PURA syndrome-causing variants on folding , nucleic acid binding , and unwinding , as well as on subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies . We expect that our experimentally determined structures of the human N- and C-terminal PUR domains offer more physiological structural reference points for future assessments of novel hsPURA mutations and their potential pathogenicity in patients . In summary , these findings indicate that RNA binding of hsPURA is important for its co-localization into stress granules and P-bodies , while we have no evidence that phase separation of hsPURA plays a role . Furthermore , after the initial description of R140P to be causative for PURA syndrome , subsequent genomic assessment of a relative of this patient uncovered that this person had the same genetic variation without any clear symptoms . Furthermore , NMR measurements with the 15N- and 1H-labeled N-terminal PUR domain yielded many spectral differences between the wild-type and K97E variants in particular within their β-sheets ( Figure 5F and Figure 5-figure supplement 3A ) . In a recent study , it was shown that a hsPURA knockdown in HeLa and in fibroblast cells resulted in down-regulation of the essential P-body proteins LSM14a and DDX6 and , most likely as a direct consequence , in strongly impaired P-body formation . The interpretation of structural flexibility and folding promiscuity of PUR domains found experimental support from the crystal structure of its K97E variant , whose mutated residue has a solvent-exposed side chain ( Figure 5B-E ) . Instead of hot-spot regions for disease-causing mutations , as reported for other genetic disorders such as neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome , pathogenic variations in PURA syndrome patients are found along the entire protein sequence . Determination of the crystal structure of hsPURA I-II revealed larger flexible regions than the previously reported invertebrate structures , with considerable differences in the four molecules of hsPURA I-II in the asymmetric unit of the crystals ( Figure 4B , Figure 5-figure supplement 2B , C ) . Recently , two publications and one manuscript uploaded to a preprint server resorted to in silico predicted , AI-based structures to model the potential impact of PURA syndrome mutations on the structural integrity of hsPURA . As we did not observe significant changes in the association of patient-related variants of hsPURA to stress granules , it is suggested that this feature may not constitute a major hallmark of the PURA syndrome . In fact , the observed great promiscuity of folding of PUR domains indicates that also moderate surface mutations such as K97E can result in promiscuous folding and the full spectrum of disease symptoms . Our study may serve as proof-of-principle that in vitro and structural studies are suitable tools to classify genetic variants in the hsPURA gene as potentially pathogenic or benign . Instead of assessing the physiologically correct dimer consisting of two PUR repeats , all three studies analyzed in silico-predicted hsPURA half-structure consisting of a single PUR repeat III with incomplete dimerization domain .

For example , processing bodies can be found in the cell’s cytoplasm , where they can be used to make proteins . However , it is not clear how these processing bodies work .

[ABSTRACT] Sweating could be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads , and this possibility is supported by the finding that wild-type mice climbed up a slippery slope more easily than TRPV4-deficient mice . Collectively , TRPV4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1 , and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4/ANO 1 complex would be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration . Reports indicate that an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 ( ANO1 ) could be widely involved in water efflux of exocrine glands , suggesting that the interaction could play a role in perspiration . Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type , but not in TRPV4-deficient mice and was inhibited by menthol both in wild-type and TRPM8KO mice . Furthermore , TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis ( AIGA ) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA . In secretory cells of sweat glands present in mouse foot pads , TRPV4 clearly colocalized with cytokeratin 8 , ANO1 , and aquaporin-5 ( AQP5 ) . Mouse sweat glands showed TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases that were inhibited by menthol . The basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We reported that several TRP channels , including TRPV1 , TRPV3 , TRPV4 , and TRPA1 , can form a complex with the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel , ANO1 , and activate ANO1 via Ca2+ entering cells through TRP channels Interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 causes Cl- efflux , followed by water efflux , suggesting that the complex could be involved in exocrine gland functions including secretion of cerebrospinal fluid , saliva , and tears . Ca2+ entering cells through TRP channels is known to be involved in various Ca2+-mediated events , particularly in non-excitable cells , whereas cation influx-induced depolarization is important for excitation of primary sensory neurons through activation of voltage-gated Na+ channels . Problems with exocrine gland function in patients with Sjögren 's syndrome as well as the low TRPV4 expression levels in patients with AIGA suggest that TRPV4 could be a key molecule involved in these diseases and that novel treatment strategies could target TRPV4 and/or ANO1 . Patients with hypohidrosis have difficulty regulating body temperature in response to high temperatures and can experience dizziness , muscle cramps , weakness , high fever , or nausea that is typically not serious . Notably , the TRPV4 , ANO1 , and AQP5 complex is confined to acinar cells in secretory sweat glands , whereas TRPV4 is also expressed at other sites in skin tissues ( Figure 1 ) . Furthermore , some patients with collagen diseases like Sjögren 's syndrome , an autoimmune exocrinopathy , suffer from hypohidrosis as well as dry mouth and dry eye that is not easily treated . This interaction could expand the importance of TRP channels in physiological functions , and complexes between TRP channels and Ca2+-activated proteins would be novel targets for drug development . Development of chemicals targeting TRPV4 , ANO1 , or the complex could be a new therapeutic strategy for these conditions , for which there are currently no effective treatments . There are two recent reports showing that TRPV4 was not critical in regulating sweating in human subjects , which is in contradiction to our mouse and human data . However , sweat glands themselves could sense local heating and cause sweating through warmth-sensitive TRPV4 channel activation that we clarified in this study . However , the finding that menthol inhibits both TRPV4 and ANO1 suggests that transient reduction in sweating by inhibiting TRPV4 and ANO1 also contributes to the cool sensation . We demonstrated that the TRPV4-ANO1 interaction is also involved in water efflux associated with the exocrine function during sweating in this study . The parameters that they examined are different from ours , and the authors examined human healthy volunteers while we used the sample of patients with AIGA . It is generally believed that signals in the brain activate sympathetic nerves that cause perspiration by releasing Ach at the sympathetic postganglionic fibers . However , patients with hypohidrosis sometimes have heatstroke , which is the most serious complication ; the incidence of heatstroke has recently increased with global warming . This local temperature sensation by TRPV4 could also be true for saliva and tear secretion that involves TRPV4/ANO1 interaction . The application of menthol to the skin produces a cool , comfortable sensation that is generally thought to result from the activation of the menthol receptor TRPM8 . On the other hand , patients with hyperhidrosis can sweat enough to soak their clothing or have sweat drip off their hands . Many TRP channels have high Ca2+ permeability , suggesting that Ca2+ entering cells through TRP channels in turn activates more Ca2+-activated proteins , including other Ca2+-activated ion channels such as Ca2+-activated K+ channels . We currently have no idea how to explain the apparently different conclusion regarding the involvement of TRPV4 . This result could indicate a specific function for the complex in water efflux occurring in exocrine glands . Hyperhidrosis can occur as a primary
[METHODS] ",,893,93,None,"During a hot day , the body is able to regulate temperature by regulating the amount of water in the blood . This process is called perspiration , and it is important to keep the body warm , but it is also important to maintain a balance between the body temperature and the temperature of the environment . The body temperature can be controlled by a number of factors , including the temperature at which it is exposed to the outside world . For example , if the temperature is too high , it can cause the body to sweat more . However , this is not always the case in people with hypohidrosis , which is a condition in which the body does not regulate the temperature . A protein called TRPV4 , known as ANO1 , has been shown to be involved in the regulation of sweating in humans . It is thought that the protein is involved in regulating sweating by interacting with a protein called anoctamin 1 . In humans , however , there is no evidence that the proteins are involved in this process .

[ABSTRACT] As neighbouring folds are gradually merged , the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory , that also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species . We observe a more than fourfold increase in effect size ( from two standard deviations to eight standard deviations ) at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses . Our results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of df = 2 . To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding , we show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology . We show that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes . Our new understanding may , therefore , generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future . Importantly , this new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale . The cerebral cortex displays a bewildering diversity of shapes and sizes across and within species . Despite this diversity , we present a universal multi-scale description of primate cortices . 5 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Compared to previous literature , we can summarise our main contribution and advance as follows : ( i ) We are showing for the first time that representative primate species follow the exact same fractal scaling - as opposed to previous work showing that they have a similar fractal dimension , i. e. , slope , but not necessarily the same offset , as previous methods had no consistent way of comparing offsets . This way of understanding has also been vividly illustrated by using the analogy of forming paper balls with papers of varying thickness in Mota and Herculano-Houzel , 2014 : comparing two paper balls of the same size ( Ae ) will show that the one that uses thicker paper ( T ) will be smoother , have larger folds and a smaller total surface area ( At ) , in comparison with the one using thinner paper . The observation that with increasing voxel sizes , the coarse-grained cortices tend to be smoother and thicker is particularly interesting : the scaling law in Equation 3 can be understood as thicker cortices ( T ) form larger folds ( or are smoother i. e. with less surface area At ) when brain size is kept constant ( Ae ) . As a practical additional outcome of our study , we could show that our novel method of deriving multiscale metrics can differentiate subtle morphological changes much better ( four times the effect size ) than the metrics we have been using so far at a single native scale . There are two aspects of this universality : first that for each and every cortex the value of Kremains the same for all scales as one removes substructures smaller than a varying length scale ( or equivalently , that the fractal dimension is almost exactly 2 . From an application perspective , our final result illustrates clearly that the surface area difference between older and younger subjects at the 'native ' scale ( i. e. original free surfer surfaces ) is negligible ( effect size smaller than two standard deviations ) . Ultimately , we hope this new framework for expressing and analysing cortical morphology , besides revealing a hitherto hidden regularity of nature , can become a powerful tool to characterise and compare cortices of different species and individuals , across development and ageing , and across health and disease . The simulated cortices would only be 'valid ' in terms of the dual universality , if it also produces the same morphological trajectories ( Note , we do not suggest to directly compare coarse-grained brain surfaces with actual biological brain surfaces . For example , any models that explicitly simulate a cortical surface as an output could be directly coarse-grained with our method and the morphological trajectories can be compared with those of actual humans and primate cortices . In the future , this approach can also be extended to cortical development and to various degenerative and congenital neuropathic conditions , especially if combined with a regionalised versions of this method applied to specific cortical regions or local patches . In the same vein of speculation , the scale-dependence of K shown in this work might , therefore , be related to different types of white matter that span different length scales , such as superficial vs. deep white matter , or U-fibres vs. major tracts . Our work does not explain any of these observations , nor are the coarse-grained versions of human brains is supposed to exactly resemble the location/pattern/features of gyri and sulci of other primates . This moves beyond our previous work where we only showed the scaling law across and within species , but all on one ( native ) scale with comparable effect sizes for classification applications . Indeed , our previously proposed model for cortical gyrification is very simple , assuming only a self-avoiding cortex of finite thickness experiencing pressures (
[METHODS] ",,886,93,None,"A large part of our brain is made up of a series of structures called cortices . These structures are made of many different shapes and sizes , but they are not all the same size . For example , some of the corticels in the brain of mammals have a shape called a voxel , while others are made from a sheet of paper . This makes it difficult to study the shape of the brain , as it is difficult to measure how much space is in the cortex . However , it is possible to measure the size of the cortex by measuring the surface area of each of the two layers of paper that surrounds the cortex: this is known as the ‘shape’ . In the brains of mammals , the cortical surface of the cerebellum is very similar to that of the rest of the body , and it is often thought that the shape is the same across species . But it is not clear how this is , or why , because the brain has a variety of shapes . To answer this question , Wang et al . used a technique called multiscale morphometry to investigate how the shape and size of cortebral cells change over time . The experiments showed that the cortex of 11 primate species , including humans , have the same shape as those of other mammalian species and that these cortibral shapes are similar to those found in other mammals . Using this method , they found that all cortite shapes are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a dimension of 2 . 5 . 6 . 7 . 8 . 9 . 10 . 11 primates , such as humans and monkeys , are able to form a similar shape"

[ABSTRACT] Further , siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells , establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα . Additionally , we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells , identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα . RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells , including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31 . Taken together , we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC . Through Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA , we predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics . The canonical NF-κB transcription factor RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocardinoma ( PDAC ) tumours . In this study , we characterised previously unexplored endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines through live single-cell imaging . Our observations revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid , sustained , and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] To identify potential regulatory loops involving RELA in PDAC , we used RNA-seq analysis with MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells treated with varying TNFα doses +/-IκB-SR. We identified 254 genes significantly regulated by TNFα , which may be viewed as candidates for targeting NF-κB signalling or output in PDAC . However , contrary to our expectations based on the findings by Hoffmann et al. , we did not observe RELA oscillations with NFKBIB or NFKBIE depletion in MIA PaCa2 or PANC1 cells , suggesting that the lack of RELA oscillations in these cell lines may be due to enhanced positive feedback and/or insufficient NFKBIA expression . We used Bayesian modelling as an unbiased and high dimensional approach to determine whether descriptors of cell shape and the cytoskeleton correlate with the observed heterogeneity in RELA localisation , having previously used Bayesian modelling to show that RELA localisation in breast cells is strongly dependent on neighbour contact , cell area , and protrusiveness in the presence and absence of TNFα . Our results also demonstrate that TNFα upregulates RNA expression of the kinase-encoding gene NUAK2 ( SNARK ) , while NUAK2 expression is abrogated in the presence of IκB-SR. Our identification of a feedback loop between RELA nuclear translocation and NUAK2 expression is analogous to prior findings that NUAK2 increases the activity of the mechanosensitive transcriptional coactivator YAP through stimulation of actin polymerisation and myosin activity . In contrast , RELA translocation responses to TNFα were identified in HeLa cells by Ankers et al. , 2016 as dependent on the cell cycle phase at the time of TNFα addition in a study using double thymidine block to synchronise cells , or Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator ( FUCCI ) labelling to infer cell cycle phase . This is in line with a recent study that endogenously fluorescently labelled RelA and c-Rel in double knockin mice and used fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy to probe for binding/dimerisation in primary ear fibroblasts to quantify the abundance of RelA : c-Rel heterodimers pre- and post-TNFα . The high sensitivity of PDAC cells to TNFα and lack of oscillations suggest that PDAC cells may suppress negative feedback imposed by IκBα , as Hoffmann et al. , 2002 demonstrated that oscillations in NF-κB DNA binding are due to negative feedback with IκBα , which is encoded by a gene ( NFKBIA ) upregulated by NF-κB factors . CDC42 is involved in the formation of premigratory filopodia in PDAC cells and promotes invasiveness , while RAC1 expression is required for the development of PDAC tumours , in addition to the formation of the ADM and PanIN precursors in KRASG12D mouse models , indicating that RAC1 may play a role in actin remodelling during PDAC initiation . From a therapeutic perspective , NUAK2 may be a promising target to follow-up for potential use in PDAC therapy as kinases contain an ATP-binding cleft that is a druggable pocket and can contain additional druggable sites distal to the ATP or substrate binding pockets conferring inhibitor specificity . Since Bayesian modelling relies on heterogeneity in measurements to make predictions , we used a dataset with five PDAC cell lines with high intra- and inter-line variability in RELA , as well as distinct cell shape and cytoskeleton features between the cell lines . Conflicting reports of whether TNFα-induced RELA translocation is cell cycle regulated may be due to cancer cell type-specific deregulation of cell cycle proteins or RELA may not physically interact with E2F1 in PDAC cells in general or specifically in unsynchronised cells . We independently ran Bayesian modelling with a dataset of cells with perturbation of the cytoskeleton using small molecules , based on the seminal study by Sachs et al. , 2005 that used Bayesian inference to derive cell signalling networks . Moreover , ARHGAP31 is not previously associated with pancreatic cancer , but has well-studied roles in actin modulation , since ARHGAP31 is the human orthologue for the mouse protein
[METHODS] ",,893,93,None,"During the course of a cell’s life cycle , the cell must respond to a variety of stresses , including stress . The immune system is able to respond to these stresses by releasing a protein called NF-B . This protein is known as RELA , which is a key regulator of the immune response . However , it is not known how RELA is activated in cells , and how it is regulated in cancer cells . To investigate this question , Xu et al . used a technique called Bayesian analysis to study the activity of the NFB protein RELA in pancreatic ductal adenocardinoma ( PDAC ) . Using this technique , they found that RELA was upregulated in PDAC cells when TNF was added to the cell , but not in the absence of it . In contrast , in the presence of the protein , Rela was downregulated in cells that had been treated with a different dose of TNF . These cells were also treated with different doses of the same protein . When the cells were treated with the same dose of the drug , RELA could be upregulated , or it could be downregulated . For example , when the cell was treated with an additional dose of NF-1 , cells were more sensitive to the effects of the new drug compared to cells that were not treated with TNF-1 . Further experiments revealed that the reactivation of RELA by TNF may be a result of the interaction between the protein and the F-actin network . Therefore , these findings suggest that the effect of T-NF on RELA may be dependent on how the cell responds to the new TNF"

[ABSTRACT] Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system , where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) inputs regulate muscle activity , we found that daf-18/PTEN mutations impact GABAergic ( but not cholinergic ) neurodevelopment and function . We found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity , therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants . Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog ( PTEN ) , the main negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway , are strongly associated with ASD . Our study provides valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs . Disruptions in the GABAergic system , which alter this equilibrium , are a common feature in various types of neurological disorders , including autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) . The defects observed in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development . However , it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling . A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition ( E/I ) is essential for proper brain function . Ketogenic diets ( KGDs ) have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances . However , the mechanisms underlying their action remain largely elusive . This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] However , since the DD commissures are defective already at the very early L1 stage ( prior to rewiring ) and similar defects are observed in VD neurons , which are born post-embryonically between late L1 and L2 stages and do not undergo this remodeling , we can infer that the deficits caused by daf-18/PTEN deficiency affect the development of the entire GABAergic system , independently of the synaptic rearrangement of DD neurons . Our results suggest that the improvement is not due to prevention in DDs because the defects are present in newly hatched larvae regardless of the presence or absence of βHB , and DD post-embryonic growth does not add new errors . Our pharmacological experiments showed that mutants associated with an exacerbation of the PI3K pathway , which typically inhibits the nuclear translocation and activity of the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO , lead to E/I imbalances that manifest as hypersensitivity to cholinergic drugs . Although ketone bodies were historically viewed as simple carriers of energy to peripheral tissues during prolonged fasting or exercise , our findings confirm more recent reports showing that βHB also possesses a variety of important signaling functions . Interestingly , mutations in eel-1 , the C. elegans ortholog of HUWE1 , or in subunits of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex , lead to developmental and functional alterations in GABAergic neurons but not in cholinergic neurons , despite their expression in both neuronal types . Our results demonstrate that reduced DAF-18/PTEN activity in C. elegans generates guidance defects , abnormal branching , incomplete commissural outgrowth , and deficient function of inhibitory GABAergic neurons , without affecting the excitatory cholinergic neurons . Multiple reports , from C. elegans to mammals , suggest that there is a sensitive period , typically early in development , where pharmacological or genetic interventions are more effective in ameliorating the consequences of neurodevelopmental defects . These low activity levels of the Insulin/Akt/PI3K pathway would allow for a high level of DAF-16/FOXO activity , which , according to our results , appears to be key for the proper development of GABAergic neurons . In adults , the DD commissure morphology is maintained , but the synaptic output shifts to dorsal muscles , and input is provided by VA and VB cholinergic motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord . Our results lead to the intriguing idea that dietary interventions that increase DAF-16/FOXO activity , such as βHB supplementation , could constitute a potential therapeutic strategy for these pathologies . Further investigations are needed to elucidate the underlying fundamental mechanisms regarding the ameliorating effects of βHB supplementation on deficits in GABAergic neurodevelopment associated with mutations in daf-18/PTEN . In newly hatched L1 larvae , each DD motor neuron innervates ventral muscles and extends a commissure to the DNC to receive synaptic inputs from cholinergic DA and DB neurons . This observation opens the possibility that one of the mechanisms by which daf-18/PTEN mutants have defects in GABAergic neurodevelopment involves integrin expression and/or function . Although understanding the mechanism behind βHB 's action will require further studies , our results demonstrate that this ketone body positively modulates DAF-16/FOXO during neuronal development . However , our results suggest that , in the C. elegans neuromuscular system , decreased activity of DAF-18/PTEN affects GABAergic development due to a downregulation of DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor activity . This observation can be explained by a critical period during neurodevelopment when the Insulin/Akt/PI3K pathway must be maintained at very low activity ( or even deactivated ) . Our results show that βHB can ameliorate the phenotypic defects of daf-18/PTEN mutants only when exposure occurs during an early critical period . Our rescue experiments strongly suggest that the PI3K/Akt/DAF-16 pathway modulates the development of GABAergic motor neurons by acting autonomously in these cells . We demonstrate here that dietary supplementation of the

When a neuron receives a signal , it is able to communicate with the rest of the body . However , when a nerve cell receives an electrical signal from another neuron , the signal is unable to be transmitted . This can lead to a disorder called autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . ASD is caused by a mutation in a gene called Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog ( PTEN ) that affects the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate ( PI3K ) pathway . In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , a protein called DAF-16/FOXO is involved in the development of the nervous system .

[ABSTRACT] Innate immune responses triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 , while host factors including proinflammatory cytokines are critical for viral containment . Mechanistically , IL-1β activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway , which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions , thus prevents syncytia formation . Together , by revealing the function and underlying mechanism of IL-1β on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion , our study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection . By utilizing quantitative and qualitative models , we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells . Through cytokine screening , we identified that interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , a key mediator of inflammation , inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains . Notably , in vivo infection experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In our study , MyD88 or IRAK4 deficiency abolished the inhibitory effect of IL-1β on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion , suggesting that these innate immune molecules are critical to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection , and this may be another mechanism accounting for the disease of those patients . Moreover , lipid nanoparticle in mRNA vaccine and penton base in adenovirus vaccine can both activate innate immune cells to amplify the protective effect of vaccines , which may also be attributed to IL-1β-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion on top of adaptive immune responses induced by the vaccines . As RhoA is ubiquitously expressed by all cell types , it is currently unclear whether IL-1-mediated RhoA activation is specific toward viral infection-associated cytoskeleton modification , or may regulate other RhoA-related processes , which is a limitation of the current work and remains to be investigated in future . In summary , this study demonstrated the function and mechanism of IL-1β in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia formation , and highlighted the function of innate immune factors including cytokines against coronaviruses transmission , thus provide potential therapeutic targets for viral control . According to our finding that both IL-1β and IL-1α are able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion , inhibition of IL-1 signaling may have abolished the antiviral function of IL-1 , thus failing to restrict virus-induced syncytia formation and transmission . Intriguingly , although anakinra , a recombinant human IL-1RA , improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality in severe COVID-19 patients , it did not reduce mortality in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients , and even increased the probability of serious adverse events . It was found that these patients ' susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed to impaired type I IFN production , which do not sense the virus correctly in the absence of MyD88 or IRAK4 . Mechanistically , IL-1β activates and enriches RhoA to the cell-cell junction between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells via the IL-1R-mediated signal to initiate actin bundle formation , preventing cell-cell fusion and viral spreading ( Figure 7-figure supplement 3 ) . Notably , IL-1β plays a key role in triggering vaccine-induced innate immunity , suggesting that innate immune responses play important roles in the antiviral defense by enhancing the protective efficacy of vaccines . Of note , cell-cell fusion is not limited to the process of viral infection , both normal and cancerous cells can utilize this physiological process in tissue regeneration or tumor evolution . Moreover , MyD88 signaling was essential for BCG-induced innate and type 1 helper T cell ( TH1 cell ) responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 , which is consistent with our fundings . In turn , activated RhoA/ROCK signaling inhibits virus-induced cell-cell fusion , so it can be targeted for future therapeutic development to control viral transmission . In addition , vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) has been reported to confer nonspecific protection against heterologous pathogens , including protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and mice . Elevated IL-1β levels in severe COVID-19 patients is central to innate immune response as it induces the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines . Cell-cell fusion is mediated by actin cytoskeletal rearrangements , the dissolution of F-actin focus is essential for cell-cell fusion ; in contrast , syncytia formation can not proceed if disassembly of actin filaments or bundles is prevented . Our current work revealed that inhibition of RhoA/ROCK signaling promoted virus-induced cell-cell fusion , possibly due to the virus hijacking of such biological process . We uncovered that preventing actin bundles dissolution inhibited virus-induced cell-cell fusion , and IL-1β-induced RhoA/ROCK signal promotes actin bundle formation at cell-cell junctions . With another note , IL-1 blockade significantly decreased the neutralizing activity of serous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in severe COVID-19 patients . With another note , patients with inherited MyD88 or IRAK4 deficiency have been reported to be selectively vulnerable to COVID-19 pneumonia . Of note , several therapeutic strategies have employed the inhibition of IL-1 signal in an attempt to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection . For example , myoblast fusion is the key process
[METHODS] ",,875,92,None,"The immune system protects the body from viruses and other pathogens , but it also protects against the spread of the virus . Infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory syndrome ( COVID-19 ) , a disease caused by a viral infection . The virus can infect many different types of cells , including the lungs , liver , kidneys and the heart . However , it is not clear how the virus can be transmitted to other parts of the body , such as the brain , heart , and liver .

[ABSTRACT] Taken together , we demonstrate that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state . To investigate the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity , we quantified the effects of nutritional and internal state changes on IPCs using electrophysiological recordings . Accordingly , activating IPCs had a small , satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity , whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity . This was reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect , where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application . Functional connectivity experiments demonstrated that these DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity , while other DH44Ns inhibit them . Refeeding flies with glucose or fructose , two nutritive sugars , significantly increased IPC activity , whereas non-nutritive sugars had no effect . Hence , populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis . Contrary to IPCs , Diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis ( DH44PINs ) responded to glucose perfusion . Drosophila insulin-producing cells ( IPCs ) are functional analogues of mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin directly into circulation . In contrast to feeding , glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity . We found that the nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity . IPC activity decreased with increasing periods of starvation . Insulin plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our experimental techniques limit our ability to capture these fast initial dynamics , since the preparation for intracellular recordings requires tens of minutes , so that we typically recorded IPC activity at least 20 min after the last food ingestion . Another reason why we performed experiments under light conditions and not in the dark is that switching from dark to light leads to a startle response in optogenetic activation experiments when the red LED is switched on , which masks behavioural responses induced by neuronal activation . However , the observation that IPC activity in flies refed with SD remained comparable to that of starved flies suggests that starvation had a long-lasting effect on IPC activity , which could specifically be restored by feeding nutritive sugars ( glucose and fructose ) . Increased insulin sensitivity has been reported in multiple mammalian studies which used a starvation-refeeding paradigm to study effects of dietary restriction on insulin release , and our results indicate that this could be similar in flies . First , although an incretin effect has not been reported in flies before , recent studies provided evidence of incretin-like hormones such as the midgut-derived neuropeptide F in flies , suggesting that a similar signaling pathway could underlie the incretin effect across species . Our in vivo recordings revealed that IPCs do not sense glucose cell-autonomously , and neither do neurons in the CNS that are directly connected to IPCs - otherwise , we would have expected an increase in IPC activity during glucose perfusion . We suspect the optogenetic effect of background light was small , though , because in genotypes that had very strong and acute effects on locomotion under red light the baseline locomotor activity under background light conditions was in the range of controls ( Figures 2I-K-4I-K ) . DILP6 mRNA in the fat body is upregulated during starvation , which has been shown to decrease systemic insulin signaling by the suppression of insulin release from IPCs , potentially contributing to mechanisms regulating insulin sensitivity in flies . This difference in insulin release is partially driven by incretin hormones from the gut , for example , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) , which are released after the ingestion of food . Contrary to DH44Ns outside the PI , activation of the glucose-sensing DH44PINs did not drive proboscis extension , suggesting that DH44PINs are not involved in feeding initiation , but primarily function in post-feeding regulation of metabolic homeostasis . Hence , our findings not only contribute to the increasing body of research on insulin signaling , but also pave the way for future research analyzing the intricacies of Drosophila neuroendocrine networks governing nutrient sensing and behavior . This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating an accumulation of DILPs and a reduction of dilp transcript levels in IPCs of adult and larval fly brains under starvation and underlines that electrophysiological IPC activity and DILP release are correlated . We speculate a similar dynamic could be present in flies , but with our approach , we capture the steady-state reached tens of minutes after food ingestion rather than a potential initial peak . However , the fact that we observed strong responses of IPCs to glucose intake but not the ingestion of regular food during refeeding suggests this is not the core mechanism underlying the incretin-like effect we observed . These parallels suggest that the regulation of insulin signaling in response to nutrient availability is an evolutionarily conserved strategy , underscoring its fundamental role in survival and metabolic homeostasis across species . We observed that IPC activity increased over a timescale of hours , which is longer compared to the fast insulin response in mammals , where insulin typically peaks within an hour of feeding . This is
[METHODS] ",,908,94,None,"In the body , cells called insulin-producing cells ( IPCs ) produce insulin , which is released into the bloodstream . The cells are able to sense and respond to changes in the environment , such as changes in their diet , and they can also detect changes in other cells in the body that affect their activity . However , it is not clear how these cells work together to maintain a healthy balance . In the fruit fly Drosophila , IPC activity is regulated by a network of neurons called the pars intercerebralis ( DH44PIN ) . These neurons are found in the brains of many different animals , including humans , mice and rats . They are also known to be involved in regulating the activity of other neurons in the nervous system , but it is unclear how these neurons work together . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called electrophysiological recordings to record the activities of the IPC neurons in fruit flies . This revealed that IPC activation was a small , satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior , while activation of a diuretic hormone 44-expressing neuron in the paras intercerebrali ( dh44pINs for short ) increased the levels of insulin in IPC cells . Similarly , activating the dhe44pins increased the activity in the fly’s brains , suggesting that this is the case in other animals . Wang enlisted the help of scientists to study the effects of dietary changes on IPC function . For example , the experiments showed that if the nutritive state was high , an IPC would release more insulin . But if it was low ,"

[ABSTRACT] We engineered an iPS cell line to express the large fragment of the split mNeonGreen protein ( mNG21-10 ) and showed that it enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the short fragment ( mNG211 ) . Using split mNeonGreen for large-scale endogenous tagging in human iPSCs would open the door to studying protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types . We also demonstrate that neural network-based image restoration enables live imaging studies of highly dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSCs . However , generating human cell lines carrying endogenous tags is difficult due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair . Recently , an engineered split mNeonGreen protein was used to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in HEK293 cells . This work represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells . Endogenous tags have become invaluable tools to visualize and study native proteins in live cells .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Unwanted editing outcomes are ignored when looking at pooled populations , and we recommend isolating and screening clonal cell lines to perform quantitative studies of desired cellular processes , as they provide a more reliable readout of protein expression , where variations in signal between cells within a population represent true cell-to-cell variability . Self-complementing split fluorescent proteins have been used for efficient endogenous tagging , and this approach was recently used for the construction of the first library of endogenous tags in HEK293 cells , with 1310 proteins tagged in mixed populations enriched by FACS . We also created a macro for image-based colony screening in 96-well plates ( Figure 3-figure supplement 1B-G ) , and used multiplexed Nanopore sequencing for high-throughput screening of selected colonies , as many amplicons can be sequenced simultaneously . We used CARE , a content-aware image restoration neural network developed by Weigert et al. , 2018 , where training datasets are created with matched images obtained using low- and high-exposures ( Figure 4 ) . Since many labs have access to spinning disk confocal or epifluorescence widefield microscopes , image restoration methods provide a way to obtain high-quality images of iPSCs without compromising on temporal resolution . We optimized a protocol for efficient single-cell recovery of 201B7 iPSCs after FACS , with up to 80 % of wells in a 96-well plate showing clonal growth after 10 days ( Figure 3A and Figure 3-figure supplement 1A ) . We also found that low endogenous expression levels can limit the detection of tagged proteins by flow cytometry , similar to previous studies , requiring microscopy with highly sensitive cameras or detectors . In addition , timelapse imaging often involves the use of over-expressing transgenes or dyes , which generate higher fluorescent signal intensity and enable the use of optical settings with lower laser power and exposure time . Importantly , the stability of fluorescence levels in endogenously tagged cell lines and the absence of localization artifacts compared to over-expressed transgenes makes this system attractive for quantitative measurements in live cells . Anillin is recruited to a narrow band at the equatorial cortex ~4 min after anaphase onset , while RhoA is also enriched but only after ~6 min and is more broadly distributed in iPSCs , while in HeLa cells they are both enriched after ~6 min and have the same breadth . With this network , cells can be imaged over extended periods of time with high temporal resolution using low exposure settings , and image files can be restored to generate high-quality movies ( Figure 4 and Figure 4-videos 1-6 ) . Cells with mutated mNG211 tags can be eliminated by screening single-cell clones based on genotype , using single-cell isolation and image-based colony screening in 96-well plates , combined with multiplexed genotyping of clones by Nanopore sequencing . Altogether , this work provides the basis for a high-quality endogenous tag library in human iPSCs , which will be used to study protein function in human stem cells and across human cell types in vitro . In this study , we generated a fully validated human iPS cell line expressing mNG21-10 for efficient endogenous tagging with mNG211 in human stem cells capable of differentiating into any cell type . Given the predicted diversity in mechanisms controlling cellular processes across cell types , there is a need to also generate endogenous tags in stem cells that can be differentiated into multiple cell types . Compared to lentiviral delivery , this design minimizes the risk of mNG21-10 silencing and provides a high and consistent expression of mNG21-10 across all cells in the population , even over time and during differentiation . Further , we observed different levels of fluorescence across a range of protein expression levels ( Figure 2-figure supplement 1A-T ) , showing that mNG21-10/mNG211 complementation is comparable to full-length fluorescent proteins . Active RhoA is also required for the cortical recruitment of anillin , yet the localization of anillin in iPSCs is more narrow compared to the other human cell lines
[METHODS] ",,871,92,None,"Cells in the human body are made up of a large number of different types of cells . Each type of cell contains a specific type of protein , which is known as a protein tag . This tag can be used to identify proteins that are present in the cell , or to track the activity of specific proteins . However , it is not clear how this tags work , and how they work . In humans , a gene called mNeonGreen has been used to create a small protein tag that can be tagged in a cell . The tag is made from a molecule called split fluorescent protein ( mNG21-10 ) . Using this protein to create the tag , researchers have now developed a new method for tagging proteins in human stem cells , using a technique called neural network imaging . To do this , the researchers used a computer program called CARE to restore the image of the tag in the cells of the human stem cell line . These images were then used to study how the tags work in different cells and how the cells respond to different conditions . They also showed that the tags can be removed from the cells by a neural network . Now , Liu et al . have used iPSCs to generate a library of endogenous tags in human cells containing a short fragment of the protein . It was found that this protein could be used for a wide range of experiments , including studies of how the proteins in the stem cells interact with each other .

[ABSTRACT] This technique is expected to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population 's role in neuronal circuit function , while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss . This electrolytic lesioning method avoids disruptive procedures , provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury , and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning . Performance of this novel lesioning technique was validated using histology from ex vivo and in vivo testing , current and voltage traces from the device , and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning . Here , we present and test a platform for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted , intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology . This technique can be used in many areas of cortex , in several species , and theoretically with any multielectrode probe . The low-cost , external lesioning device can also easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup . A custom-built current source provides stable current and allows for controlled , repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals . They stand to provide additional insight if integrated with multielectrode techniques common in systems neuroscience . Lesion studies have historically been instrumental for establishing causal connections between brain and behavior .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] One recent study , , developed an inactivation method that is effectively combined with stable electrophysiology by creating photothrombotic lesions through a chronic cranial window integrated with an electrocorticography ( ECoG ) array , which may be appropriate for applications where local field potential ( LFP ) recording is sufficient . Therefore , we have triangulated evidence from three distinct sources that indicate the electrolytic lesioning device reliably delivered current that caused tissue damage and neuron death ( termination ) : ex vivo and in vivo histology ( Figures 2 and 3 ) , lesion device readouts ( Figure 6 ) , and relative changes in the turnover rate of recorded neurons in vivo ( Figure 7C and D , case 1 ) . However , typical current values for microstimulation are around three times smaller than for lesioning , pulse durations are on the order of tens of microseconds , and the pulses are charged balanced so they by design do not lead to cell death or materially affect the electrodes . In this manuscript we demonstrate electrolytic lesioning spanning two multielectrode probes across rabbits , pigs , sheep , and rhesus macaques , and our same device could be easily used with other smaller species , like rats , in which multielectrode probes have been successfully implanted . In both techniques , the location of the lesion is tied to the location of the electrophysiology ( for Khateeb et al. , wherever the cranial window and ECoG array are ; for this technique , wherever the multielectrode probe has been implanted ) , which ensures that the electrophysiology will include recordings from the perilesional area . For example , while Khateeb et al. , notes that the approach could be adapted for use in smaller organisms , no modification is needed for use in other species with this work 's approach-so long as a multielectrode probe is implantable . In this manuscript , we have shown that the amount and duration of direct current are significant determinants of lesion size and shape , while with photothrombotic lesions , light intensity and aperture diameter are the signiﬁcantly relevant parameters . The main requirements for use are that the probe has two electrodes that can directly ( via whatever necessary adapters ) connect to the lesioning device , such that arbitrary current can be passed into them as the anode and cathode . One potential advantage of photothrombotic approaches is the use of optical tools to monitor anatomical and physiological changes after lesioning through the cranial window , though the research utility of this monitoring remains to be demonstrated . Although a different op amp could easily be used to accommodate a higher electrode impedance , it is unlikely that this would be necessary , since most electrodes have impedances between 100 kΩ to 1 MΩ . The PA97 op-amp used in this lesioning device has a slew rate of 8V/μs , and can support AC frequencies in the tens to hundreds of kHz range for the lesioning voltages seen here . It is evident in our recordings that many of the array 's electrodes are recording smaller inseparable waveforms ( hash ) corresponding to many different neurons located between between 50 μm and 140 μm from the electrode tip before the lesion . Selection of the electrical current pattern , amplitude , and duration , as well as the specific lesion electrodes ' shape and location , offers many different combinations for complementary investigations into the causal role of cortical activity . This was likely the case for the first lesion in Monkey U ( Figure 7A , top ) and lesion six ( Monkey H ; Figure 7A bottom ) , where the average waveforms on the two lesion electrodes themselves appear similar with only slight differences in amplitude . For example , we demonstrated use
[METHODS] ",,902,94,None,"Lesions in the brain can be caused by a variety of factors , including changes in the size of the brain , the number of neurons in a particular area , and the size and shape of the damage . The brain is made up of many different types of cells , which are able to communicate with each other . In some cases , a lesion can be triggered by electrical impulses , such as electrical currents . However , it is not clear how these signals are transmitted . For example , in animals , when a neuron is injured , an electrical current can be transmitted to the brain via a small electrical circuit , called a cranial window . This is where the electrical current passes through the brain and causes the brain to become damaged . It is important to understand how the brain works , because it can be difficult to determine how the disease affects the brain or how it affects other parts of the body . To do this , researchers need to record the activity of a specific type of neuron in order to determine whether the injury is caused by an electrical impulse or by another neuron . One way to do this is to insert a probe into the brain’s brain . If the probe is implanted into the skull of an animal , this can be used to record electrical activity from the brain of that animal . Using this technique , Khateeb et al . have now developed a new method that can be applied to a wide range of animals . These animals have a large number of brain cells that are connected to the electrodes on the brain that are attached to the probe . They are then recorded using electrodes that are embedded in the skin , but the probes can be easily removed from the skin by removing them from the electrode . Kh"

[ABSTRACT] Here , we use an assay for the detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ) . As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts , we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops . Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of imidacloprid , thiamethoxam , clothianidin , or sulfoxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude , even when these solutions contained lethal doses . Studies of bee detection of neonicotinoids have reported contradictory evidence about whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and hence avoid them . These data provide strong evidence that bumblebees can not detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts . Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation . One of the largest risks bees face is poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides . Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops , but their populations are at risk when pesticides are used .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Although we were able to measure small but significant reduction in the responses of both labial palp and galeal neurons caused by the high concentrations ( 100 µM ) of IMD , SFX , and TMX , this effect was not sufficient for the clustering algorithm to form classes of distinct stimuli for the OSR-pesticide mixtures . While it is possible that the sensilla on the antennae or tarsi could detect TMX , it seems unlikely given that honeybees have limited bitter detection in these locations , only observed when the sensilla are contacted with concentrations of compounds like QUI that are > 1 mM . The labial palps in other insects such as locusts are used to detect both phagostimulants and deterrant compounds , so we might have rationally expected to observe labial palp GRNs that spike in response to QUI and cholinergic pesticides , but we did not . Although Arce et al. , 2018 switched the feeders between training and testing phases , this may not have been sufficient to rule out the possibility that bees could learn the location of the food within a single feeding bout . For this reason , we were mainly testing for the reduction of GRN spiking caused by the suppression of sugar-sensing GRNs , as all of the 'bitter ' compounds we tested were presented to the sensilla in OSR nectar ( a mixture of primarily fructose and glucose ) . This conclusion is consistent with the expectation that a preference resulting from post-ingestive reinforcement caused by amplification of the brain 's response to sugars would be expected to develop following long-term , repeated exposure to a pharmacological compound . Similarly , in our previous work , we found that individual bees developed a preference for solutions containing TMX if they were confined to feed on a choice between sucrose and sucrose laced with pesticide over longer time period . The field-relevant concentrations of the pesticides we tested are between 3-6 orders of magnitude lower in concentration ; such dilute concentrations of a bitter compound present in a highly concentrated sugar solution would be difficult for most organisms to detect . We concluded that the preference was caused by the pharmacological action of TMX on cholinergic circuits involved in encoding reward in the insect brain , as we found no electrophysiological evidence to support that bees could taste neonicotinoids . This could indicate that that small differences detected at the sensory periphery do not translate into a sufficient signal across the whole population of gustatory neurons to produce an aversion to foods containing potential toxins . Different solutions were used because it was not possible to record from neurons with such a concentrated sugar solution , and in behavioural experiments , most bumblebees do not find 10 % OSR sufficiently phagostimulatory to feed . Compounds reach the hemolymph of honeybees within 30 s of ingestion , and quinine causes malaise-like symptoms , so it is feasible that the bumblebees in our behavioural assay factored in post-ingestive feedback while consuming 0 . This supports the idea that encoding of gustatory stimuli is accomplished by the whole population of GRNs on a given body part ( e. g. the proboscis ) as was observed in multichannel recordings from the adult hawkmoth maxillary nerve . We expect that if taste was the mechanism for the preference , the bees would have shown a preference for the TMX solution within the first foraging bout , similar to the time frame of our behavioural assay in this study ( 2 min ) . Importantly , our new data were able to confirm that field-relevant concentrations of pesticides did not significantly alter the pattern or rate of spiking of galeal or labial palp GRNs towards a nectar solution . Thus , activity across the mouthparts GRN population that includes temporal input over time is likely to

The experiments showed that bee salivary glands detect pesticidal compounds in the solution . However , the bee was unable to detect these compounds in other parts of the body , such as the antennae , tarsi , or salivary cells . These findings suggest that the aversion of bee to the pesticide may be due to the fact that the insect's mouthpart can only detect these chemicals if it is in the same solution as the insect . Arce and Arce have now tested whether bee larvae can detect the concentrations of pesticide in the honeybee's saliva . In the experiments , each bee ate a small amount of the pesticide , which was a mixture of sugars and fructose and a compound called imidacloprid . When the insect was exposed to a high concentration of the insecticide , it ate more of it . This suggests that the insects are at a higher risk of poisoning if they are exposed to more than one pesticide ."

[ABSTRACT] Meta-analysis of 6322 NHPs from 148 sites reveals that prevalence is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia , with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo . These findings address critical gaps in understanding regional P. knowlesi epidemiology and indicate that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk . By assembling remote sensing data and fitting statistical models to prevalence at multiple spatial scales , we identify novel relationships between P. knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation . This suggests that higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity , which would begin to explain observed geographic variation in parasite burden . Non-human primates ( NHPs ) host Plasmodium knowlesi , a zoonotic malaria of public health concern and the main barrier to malaria elimination in Southeast Asia . Zoonotic disease dynamics in wildlife hosts are rarely quantified at macroecological scales due to the lack of systematic surveys . Here , we systematically assemble reports of NHP P. knowlesi and investigate geographic determinants of prevalence in reservoir species . We find that regions exhibiting higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots . In wildlife and humans , parasite transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation . Understanding of regional P. knowlesi infection dynamics in wildlife is limited .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This study also demonstrates the utility of systematic meta-analysis tools and remote-sensing datasets in the investigation of macroecological disease trends , in conjunction with methods to standardise a spatially heterogeneous dataset and data-driven selection of spatial scales . Prevalence of P. knowlesi in macaques is likely to be a crucial determinant of human infection risk , and more representative estimates of P. knowlesi prevalence derived here can better inform regional transmission risk models . Given the clear intersection between human epidemiology and wildlife ecology , it is essential that infection dynamics within wildlife reservoirs are considered in future public health interventions . Strong links have been identified between land use and land cover change and ecosystem perturbation that favours the transmission of vector-borne diseases . While the full complexity is not captured by the covariates used , it is clear that P. knowlesi infection in NHPs is not restricted to densely forested areas . Notwithstanding limitations , this study highlights the marked spatial heterogeneity and role of landscape complexity in driving P. knowlesi infection rates in NHPs . Gaps identified in data reporting should inform more systematic and localised primatological surveys to disentangle precise mechanisms . Findings provide evidence that P. knowlesi in primate hosts is partly driven by landscape modification across Southeast Asia . This study also characterises landscape risk factors for heightened prevalence of P. knowlesi in NHPs .

[ABSTRACT] To elucidate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events , we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae . Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana , associated with Pinopsida ( conifer ) host plants , with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches . Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined , evolving new trophic interactions , including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms . Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana 's breakup , surviving on distant , disjunct landmasses . Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia ( Australian region ) and Proterhinus ( Hawaiian Islands ) have relatively recent origins . The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This is particularly noticeable even within some belid genera , whose larvae have been found developing in similar tissues ( under bark and in branches ) of different plant families , both between congeneric species ( e. g. Sphinctobelus ) and in single species ( e. g. Isacantha , Rhicnobelus ) ; however , there are some cases known in Belidae where the use of plant organs is apparently plastic and opportunistic ( e. g. Apagobelus brevirostris ( Lea ) reared from both stems and cones of Araucaria ; Zimmerman , 1994 ) . Even though our reconstruction provides support for their ancestral hosts most likely being the Pinopsida , which is in accordance with our clade age estimates , angiosperm hosts can not be completely ruled out , considering that crown angiosperms are now thought to have originated earlier than Belidae , in the interval between the late Permian and the latest Jurassic ( 256-149 Ma ) . The type of plant organ used for larval development shows few shifts from the ancestral state ( branches ) : in Belinae to ovulate and/or pollen cones ( or 'female and/or male strobili ' ) of Pinopsida ( arguably a shift ; possibly just opportunistic development alongside that in twigs and branches ) in some Agnesiotidini and Pachyurini , in Oxycoryninae to ovulate cones of Pinopsida in Oxycraspedus , fleshy flowers/fruits of parasitic angiosperms in Oxycorynina and pollen cones of cycads in Allocorynina . Possible host shifts to ferns in the Paleogene in the Neotropical genera Trichophthalmus and Homalocerus must be viewed with great reservation , as all host records of these genera are only based on the collection of adults , without any evidence of adult feeding , oviposition or larval development . It is plausible , then , that the ancestors of the remaining oxycorynine tribes/subtribes were originally associated with these conifers before their decline by the Eocene and that these oxycorynine lineages adapted to this decrease in conifer availability by host-shifting to various distantly related taxa of Angiospermae and Cycadopsida . With 159 species described from the Hawaiian Islands , Proterhinus is another example of the spectacular radiation of Hawaiian insects , along with , e. g. , the nearly 1000 species of Drosophilidae ( Diptera ) , more than 400 species of Hyposmocoma ( Lepidoptera : Cosmopterigidae ) , over 110 species of Plagithmysus ( Coleoptera : Cerambycidae ) and more than 190 species of Nesophrosyne ( Hemiptera : Cicadellidae ) . Its current hosts , Araucariaceae , were widely distributed in Mesozoic times , and when the oxycorynines diverged by the Lower Cretaceous according to our dated phylogeny estimate , Araucaria still constituted an abundant and widely distributed host for beetles . The Aglycyderini evidently shifted onto angiosperms as well , but their pattern of host associations is complex and indeterminate as the larvae of most species develop in dead bark and twig tissues of a variety of plants . The history of the other two South American genera , Homalocerus and Trichophthalmus , could potentially also be elucidated through the vicariance process ( though we can not rule out the possibility of dispersal to South America ) . Such host 'jumps ' are typical for endemic Hawaiian phytophagous insects , e. g. , Carposina ( Lepidoptera : Carposinidae ) and Nesosydne ( Hemiptera : Delphacidae ) , but some lineages have high host plant specificity e. g. , Philodoria ( Lepidoptera , Gracillariidae ) and Nesophrosyne ( Hemiptera : Cicadellidae ) . Little is known about the host plants of Proterhinus , but what is known suggests that host plant ranges ( e. g. in P. deceptor Perkins , P. obscurus Sharp and P. vestitus Sharp ) are remarkably broader than in other species of Belidae . The placements of Trichophthalmus and Homalocerus are likely to be artifacts because they result from sparse and non-overlapping data ( four Sanger and 13 anchored-hybrid-enrichment loci , respectively ) . The common ancestor of Rhinotia might have colonized Acacia in the early
[METHODS] ",,873,92,None,"Insects have evolved to live in a variety of environments , including forests , grasslands , trees and shrubs . They are also known as phytophagous weevils , and they have been found in many parts of the world . The beetle family Belidae is a subfamily of bees that includes the genus Rhinotia , which is found in Australia and the Hawaiian Islands . It was first described in the 18th century , but it was not until the 19th century that it was formally recognized . In the 1880s a group of belids called the crown group , or crown-group , was discovered in the Australian region of Australia , where it was found . This group was known to have evolved from a single species of plant , called Pinopsida ( conifer ) , to a more distantly related species called Cycadopsis . However , it is not clear how this group evolved . To investigate this question , Weevil et al . used a combination of molecular and fossil data to build a time tree for the beetings of the Belids family . These data were then combined with information from fossils to create a timeline of the evolution of the kingdom . Using these data , we found that the crown groups of belies evolved to be more closely related to the plants that they grew on .

[ABSTRACT] Our methods shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology . Here , we leverage published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas , each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions . Using spatial metrics of evolution , we find that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume instead of at the surface . In growing cell populations such as tumours , mutations can serve as markers that allow tracking the past evolution from current samples . The genomic analyses of bulk samples and samples from multiple regions have shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on tumours . We determine how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth . However , little is known empirically on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Future techniques to sequence resected tumours at higher spatial and genomic resolution than currently possible will allow to trace key later-stage evolutionary changes like angiogenesis , effects of the tumour microenvironment , or the development of genetic instability . Mutations might thus be present at low frequency in a particular sample , because the cells carrying it migrated from afar , rather than because the mutation either arose late during the growth of the tumour or was under negative selection . Instead , in its early stage , the tumour was balanced precariously between continued growth to macroscopic size and shrinkage : A small increase in the rate of cell death , or a small decrease in the growth rate would have caused the small net growth rate to become negative , possibly even leading to the extinction of the tumour . We found that this effect can be highly advantageous when assessing the mutations in a tumour from a limited number of samples : cells carrying a particular mutation can migrate into a spatial region that is later sampled . Hence , cells that were initially adjacent to each other and share a mutation can get pushed apart during the course of tumour growth and end up with a large distance between them . We find the same level of dispersal of mutations in off-lattice simulations of growing tissues , where it is due to cells pushing each other out of the way as a part of the growth process . We are not the first to link spatial tumour sampling with evolution : on a larger spatial scale , phylogenetic comparison of samples from primary and metastatic tumours has elucidated the dynamics of metastasis . In this data , the dominant mutational signature in early mutations is associated with an exogenous mutagen ( aristolochic acid ) found in herbal traditional Chinese medicine and thought to cause liver cancer . We have found mutations in the tumour that are widely dispersed throughout the tumour ; as a result they can have low frequencies in one particular sample but high frequencies in other parts of the tumour . In the data set of Li et al. , 2022 , the same signature is dominant both in the early and late mutations , compatible with a continuous dose of the mutagen . Based on the high-resolution data of Ling et al. , 2015 , we found a drastic difference between the mutational signature of early and late mutations . Analyses of multiple samples from the same tumour have established intra-tumour heterogeneity and found neutral evolution in many cases , as well as instances of selection . Increasing the genomic and spatial resolution will allow to identify mutations of lower frequency and thus characterize the in-vivo evolution beyond the early stages . We have used genetic data taken from hepatocellular tumours at high spatial resolution to analyse the early evolution of a tumour in vivo . The high spatial resolution also allows to track changes in the mutational processes over evolutionary time far more easily than in bulk data . We found that the tumour evolved under uniform volume growth ; there was no evidence of spatial constraints leading to radially outward growth . Also , the spatial and genomic resolution of any data set imposes limits on how late stage events can be observed . Here , we have used the spatial information contained in data based on hundreds of samples from single tumours . For instance , tumours that are not encapsulated might have a more heterogeneous environment , and evolve under surface growth . The rate of cell death being comparable to that of cell division implies that the tumour grew much more slowly than suggested by the rate of cell division . Our results are based on three well-encapsulated hepatocellular tumours , resected and sampled in two and three dimensions . We estimate that the data analysed here capture the evolutionary dynamics up to 80 , 000 cells . This signature is absent in late mutations , compatible with a discontinued

[ABSTRACT] Furthermore , we demonstrated that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway , regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form . In summary , these findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor . Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor CcTRPM regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis by impacting cuticle content and thickness . In this study , we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis . Firstly , we identified CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β as two typical subunits of Bursicon in C. chinensis , which were regulated by low temperature ( 10 °C ) and CcTRPM . Finally , we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R , contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis . Subsequently , CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness . Cacopsylla chinensis exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism , specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form , which have distinct morphological phenotypes . Bursicon , also known as the tanning hormone , is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle . Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity . However , the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In C. chinensis , cuticle pigment absorbance and cuticle thickness , both have an increasing trend over time under 10 °C conditions , and showed very high correlation with the nymph phenotype of cuticle tanning during the transition from summer-form to winter-form . Future research will focus on : ( 1 ) studying the combined effect of Bursicon with other neuro-hormones on the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis , ( 2 ) identifying the down-stream signaling of Bursicon in mediating this phenomenon through multi-omics and RNAi approaches . Moreover , the presence of both thin and thick chitin layers observed in the dsEGFP treatment of Figure 2D could potentially be ascribed to the chitin content in the insect midgut or fat body as previously discussed . Further results from RNAi-mediated knockdown of CcBurs-α , CcBurs-β , or both showed that Bursicon prominently regulates the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis by affecting cuticle pigment content , cuticle chitin content , and cuticle thickness ( Figure 2C-I ) . In our study , nymphal cuticles exhibited normal differentiation patterns , characterized by a thin epicuticle and comparable widths of the endocuticle and exocuticle following dsEGFP treatment , as illustrated in Figures 2F and 4F . Temporal expression patterns showed that CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β have very similar gradually increasing expression trends and higher expression in winter-form than summer-form ( Figure 1-figure supplement 3C-D ) , indicating that Bursicon may play a significant role in winter-form . In conclusion , our study uncovered a novel role of Bursicon and its receptor in regulating the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis , in addition to their known functions in cuticle-hardening of nymphs and wing expansion of adults . It is notable that during the process of cuticle staining , the chitin located in the midgut and fat body of C. chinensis may exhibit green fluorescence , leading to the appearance of a thin chitin layer . For example , miR-133 controls behavioral aggregation by targeting the dopamine synthesis gene in Locusts , and miR-9b targets insulin receptors to mediate dimorphism and wing development in aphids . As the transition of C. chinensis from summer-form to winter-form is regulated by a low temperature of 10 °C and CcTRPM , we next determined the effect of 10 °C treatment and CcTRPM RNAi on the expression of CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β . By comparing its expression profiles with those in other insects , we can conclude that the spatio-temporal expression of the Bursicon receptor is related to the specificity of insect species . Knockdown of CcBurs-α , CcBurs-β , or both obviously decreased the expression of CcBurs-R , while feeding the heterodimer protein of α+β fully rescued CcBurs-R expression after knockdown of CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β together , which further confirmed the relationship between subunits and the receptor ( Figure 3D-F ) . When nymphs were treated with agomir-6012 , they exhibited lower cuticle pigment content , reduced cuticle chitin content , and thinner cuticle thickness compared to the agomir-NC control under 10 °C condition . Notably , the elimination of CcBurs-R in C. chinensis obviously affected cuticle pigment content , cuticle chitin content , and cuticle thickness , leading to the failure of the transition from summer-form to winter-form ( Figure 4B-H ) . The significant decreased in CcTre1 and CcCHS1 expression after agomir-6012 treatment suggested that miR-6012 also functions as the upstream regulator of chitin biosynthesis signaling . The transcript levels of both subunits were higher in the head and cuticle of winter-form compared to summer-form , implying a potential role of Bursicon in seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis . Then , CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β form a heterodimeric neuropeptide that acts on its receptor CcBurs-R to mediate the transition from summer-form

[ABSTRACT] Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin , an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo , in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat , resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability . Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 ( H3-K27M ) is a driver mutation in DMGs , reshaping the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis . Finally , in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination . Moreover , transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR . Diffuse midline gliomas ( DMGs ) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments . In search of effective treatment , we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) and MYC in these tumors . H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways , as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway . These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While PIN1 is not overexpressed in DMG tumors , we show that Sulfopin , although not inhibiting MYC directly , downregulates MYC target genes in patient-derived DMG cells and affects cell survival in an H3-K27M-dependent manner . While treating cells with Vorinostat alone increased H3K27ac levels , as expected , the combined treatment attenuated the accumulation of this mark on promoters and enhancers of prominent oncogenes , resulting in their decreased expression . The high levels of H3K27ac in H3-K27M cells was also linked to activation of super-enhancers , which regulate the expression of oncogenes and genes that are associated with an undifferentiated state . However , emerging resistance to HDACi in glioma cells , as well as limited therapeutic benefits of HDACi treatment as a sole agent , highlight the necessity to discover additional therapy modalities that could prolong survival and relieve symptoms . Despite decades of efforts to improve treatment for children diagnosed with H3-K27M-mutant DMGs , the standard of care remains solely radiation , with no significant improvement in overall survival . This Sulfopin-mediated attenuation could potentially result from downregulation of MYC targets , as it was recently shown that MYC overexpression results in H3K27ac gain on super-enhancers . We showed that combining Sulfopin treatment with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat reduced cell viability by 80 % in several tumor-derived DMG lines originating from different patients . However , H3-K27M cells do not show an increase in interferon stimulated genes ( ISGs ) , preassembly due to high levels of MYC , which is potent antagonist of interferon responses . In H3-K27M-mutant DMGs , as well as in many other malignancies , high MYC activity is correlated with poor prognosis and therefore considered as an attractive therapeutic target . Thus , dual targeting of both HDAC and MYC pathways has the potential of inducing robust expression of ISGs , thus promoting tumor cell death mediated by viral mimicry . This is perhaps due to the relatively large tumors already formed at the onset of treatment , leading to rapid deterioration of mice in all experimental groups . High-throughput drug screens in patient-derived cells identified HDAC inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy , and ongoing clinical trials revealed preliminary evidence of clinical benefit . Among the loci that accumulate this modification are repetitive elements and endogenous retroviruses , resulting in their aberrant expression , potentially inducing innate immune responses . The combined treatment with Sulfopin and Vorinostat led to robust inhibition of several target proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway , likely via alternative pathways . Specifically , AKT gain or PTEN loss is detected in approximately 70 % of DMG tumors , and a recent study showed high expression of mTOR in DMGs . One potential candidate is the mTOR-dependent cell growth through MYC regulation , which may be impaired by Sulfopin treatment , inhibiting MYC transcriptional activity . These results are in line with the contribution of MYC signaling to H3-K27M-driven tumorigenesis , underscoring the therapeutic potential of Sulfopin for these aggressive brain tumors . Of note , drug agents targeting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 were shown to be highly effective in DMG cells as well as in murine models . Our findings emphasize epigenetic dependencies of H3-K27M-driven gliomas and highlight the therapeutic potential of combined treatments for this aggressive malignancy . Here , we show that H3-K27M cells are vulnerable to transcriptional disruption mediated by the combined treatment with Sulfopin and Vorinostat . Attempts to restrict mTOR signaling using first-generation mTOR inhibitors primarily inhibited mTORC1 , which often caused upregulation of mTORC2 . HDAC inhibition , in combination with the novel MYC inhibitor , inhibited oncogenic transcriptional signatures and reduced tumor growth in vivo . Moreover , as a transcription factor , MYC lacks traditionally druggable binding pockets , hindering the development of direct small molecule binders . In summary , we propose a novel therapeutic strategy targeting epigenetic and transcriptional pathways in H3-K27M-mutant DMG
[METHODS] ",,888,93,None,"The brain is made up of many different types of cells , including neurons , nerve cells and glial cells . These cells are called midline gliomas , and they are often caused by a mutation in one of these genes . This mutation is known as H3-K27M , which is found on histones . It is thought that this mutation is responsible for the formation of these tumors , but it is not known how this mutation affects the development of the tumors in the brain . To find out more about how this gene is affected , Weidman et al . used a technique called X-ray crystallography to study the effects of a drug called Sulfopin on the growth of DMG tumors from mice . The experiments showed that SulFopin inhibited the activity of two genes , HDAC and MYC , that are involved in the development and progression of the disease . However , the results of the experiments were not well understood . Instead , we used xenografts that were grown in a laboratory to study how the drug was able to reduce the growth and development of these cancers in mice , compared to the normal cells that had been treated with the same drug . In the experiments , mice that were treated with a combination of drugs , such as PIN1 and HDAC , were less likely to develop the tumor . Moreover , these mice were more likely to die from the disease than normal cells if the drug had been used alone . Further experiments revealed that the combination of the two drugs reduced the growth rate of the DMGs in patients with the mutation . Overall , this study highlights the potential of this drug combination as a promising treatment for DMG"

[ABSTRACT] For a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens , the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood by P. leucopus , Mus musculus , and Rattus norvegicus and adjusted for white cell concentrations . The white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus , a long-lived rodent , is a key reservoir in North America for agents of several zoonoses , including Lyme disease , babesiosis , anaplasmosis , and a viral encephalitis . LPS-treated P. leucopus , in contrast to mice and rats , also displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes . Deermice were distinguished from the mice and rats by LPS response profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages . The phenomenon was associated with comparatively reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors in the deermice . The results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and perhaps other animal reservoirs for agents of human disease . While persistently infected , this deermouse is without apparent disability or diminished fitness . These characteristics of P. leucopus were also noted in a Borrelia hermsii infection model .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The combination of these two signaling events , that is one through surface TLR4 by LPS itself and another through intracellular PPR ( s ) by to-be-defined ERV products , manifested in mice and rats as a response profile that had features of both a response to a virus with type 1 interferon and ISGs and a response to a bacterial PAMP like LPS with acute phase reactants such as calprotectin and serum amyloid . While deermice may not be in the same longevity league as the naked mole-rat ( Heterocephalus glaber ) , which can live for over 30 years Oka et al. , 2023 , some features of naked mole-rat immunology are intriguingly similar to what we have observed for P. leucopus . Since humans are transmission dead-ends for B. burgdorferi and many other zoonotic agents in their life cycles , it is not surprising that human infections are generally more debilitating if not fatal than what adapted natural hosts experience . P. maniculatus has been successfully infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the respiratory route , but the infected animals displayed only mild pathology , manifested little if any disability , and recovered within a few days Fagre et al. , 2021 ; Griffin et al. , 2021 . The localized or systemic presence of the microbe is a necessary condition for Lyme disease , but the majority of the symptoms and signs are attributable to inflammation elicited by the organism 's presence and not from virulence properties per se or the hijacking of host cells . A paradoxical enlistment of antiviral defenses , including type 1 and type 2 interferons , for an infection with an extracellular bacterium , like B. burgdorferi , may bring about more harm than benefit , especially if the resultant inflammation persists after antibiotic therapy . While a strength of the study was use of an outbred population of M. musculus to approximate the genetic diversity of the P. leucopus in the study , this meant that some genes of potential relevance might have gone undetected , that is from type II error . While the rodents in these experiments were housed in the same facility and ate the same diet , we can not exclude inherent differences in gastrointestinal microbiota between species and individual outbred animals as co-variables for the experimental outcomes . These include macrophages and blood myeloid cells with low to absent transcription of Nos2 or production of nitric oxide in response to LPS , even in the presence of added interferon-gamma Gorshkova et al. , 2023 . Although Nos2 gene knockouts in M. musculus had lower LPS-induced mortality than their wild-type counterparts , the mutants were more susceptible to the protozoan Leishmania major and the facultative intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes . For some traits , especially ones that are complex or under balancing selection , even sample sizes of 10 in each group may not have provided sufficient power for discrimination between deermice and mice . Our studies of P. leucopus began with a natural population and documented a > 80 % prevalence of infection and high incidence of re-infections by B. burgdorferi in the area 's white-footed deermouse , the most abundant mammal there . In selective cases we could point to supporting evidence in the literature on M. musculus and the phenotypes of relevant gene knockouts , but there are no such resources for Peromyscus as yet . Both tolerance of and resistance to the tickborne encephalitis flavivirus Powassan virus by P. leucopus were demonstrated in an experimental model in which mice , by contrast , were severely affected Mlera et al. , 2017 . The presence of these protozoa affects innate and adaptive immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract , but it is not clear whether there are systemic consequences of colonization by this flagellate . Like P. leucopus and in distinction to M. musculus , naked mole-rats showed an increase in the proportion of neutrophils
[METHODS] ",,894,93,None,"Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria called Peromyscus leucopus , which is found in many parts of the world . The disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of a white-footed deermouse , a species of rodent that can live for up to 30 years .

To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) to study the immune responses of the white footed Deermococcus leucopus . In the experiments , the mice and rats were treated with LPS and showed that the mice had less immune responses than the rats . This was due to a decrease in the levels of the antiviral molecules in the blood of the deermice compared to mice or rats , suggesting that this is a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and perhaps other animals . Wang also found that mice and mice were more likely to be infected with B . burgdorferi , another bacteria that causes Lyme Disease . These findings suggest that LPS may be an important tool for understanding how the immune system responds to infections in humans , but that it may also be used in other animals that have been exposed to other pathogens such as viruses ."

[ABSTRACT] These results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals . Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7 . These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate . In humans , CASP3 and CASP7 recognize the same consensus motif DxxD , which is present in gasdermin E ( GSDME ) . In this study , we identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7 . Caspase ( CASP ) is a family of proteases involved in cleavage and activation of gasdermin , the executor of pyroptosis . This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate ( except mammalian ) CASP7 . In mammals , the key residue is conserved in non-primates ( e. g. , mouse ) but not in primates . However , human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7 . p10 contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination . The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear . However , mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Since , unlike non-mammalian vertebrates , mammals possess multiple pyroptotic GSDM members ( GSDMA , B , C , D , and E ) , the functional divergence of CASP7 from CASP3 may have occurred as a result of specific and non-redundant regulation of programmed cell death mediated by different executor molecules . In this study , we found that different from human GSDME , a pufferfish GSDME belonging to the teleost GSDMEa lineage was specifically cleaved by both CASP3 and CASP7 at the site of DAVD to liberate the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment . Different from GSDMD , we found that for TrGSDME , mutation of either the P4 ( D255 ) or P1 ( D258 ) residue of the consensus motif 255DAVD258 made it resistant to CASP3/7 , implying a lack of DAVD-independent cleavage mechanism . In tongue sole ( Cynoglossus semilaevis ) , GSDMEb is preferably cleaved by CASP1 to trigger pyroptosis ; in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) , GSDMEb is activated by caspy2 ( CASP5 homolog ) through the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 ( NLRP3 ) inflammasome signaling pathway . These results indicate that the CT domain , which is well accepted to exert an inhibitory effect on the pore-forming NT domain , is the target of HsCASP7 discrimination , and hence determines the cleavability of GSDME by HsCASP7 . Recently , Wang and Liu studied the molecular mechanism of human GSDMD recognition by CASP1/4 and showed that GSDMD-CT interacted with CASP1/4 exosites through binding to a hydrophobic pocket , which enhanced the recognition by CASP1/4 and contributed to tetrapeptide sequence-independent cleavage of GSDMD . The complicated scenario of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis signaling in fish is likely due to the reason that , unlike mammals that have multiple GSDM members to induce pyroptosis under different conditions , fish have only GSDME to induce pyroptotic cell death . Comparative study on the functions of GSDMEa and GSDMEb is scarce , and it remains to be explored whether clear physiological roles are played by these two orthologs in fish . However , in our study , we found that these two motifs are conserved in human and pufferfish CASP7 , and they had no apparent effect on the substrate discrimination of HsCASP7 . By a series of residue swapping and mutation analyses , we discovered that the residue in the position of 245 ( in TrCASP7 ) or 234 ( in HsCASP7 ) of the p10 subunit was the key that determined CASP7 cleavage of HsGSDME . NT/CT domain swapping between HsGSDME and TrGSDME showed that chimeric GSDMEs containing the TrGSDME-CT domain were cleaved by human as well as pufferfish CASP7 regardless of the source of the NT , whereas chimeric GSDMEs containing the HsGSDME-CT domain were resistant to HsCASP7 . One of the physiological consequences is that CASP7 frees itself from the GSDME-mediated pathway and thus is able to be engaged in other cellular processes . In contrast , this Asn residue was changed to Ser in the CASP7 of mammals , especially primates , resulting in divergence of CASP7 from CASP3 in substrate recognition and cleavage . It is intriguing that , although HsCASP3 and 7 were indistinguishable in proteolysis toward the consensus tetrapeptide , they differed remarkably in the cleavage of HsGSDME and TrGSDME . These results suggest that , compared to GSDMD , GSDME has a distinct enzyme-substrate engagement mode that , as demonstrated in the present study , involves GSDME-CT . The swapping of p20 between HsCASP7 and TrCASP7 revealed that the two catalytic motifs in p20 , that is , SHG and QACRG , were not involved in HsCASP7 discrimination on GSDME . Similarly , human CASP7 and GSDME may also have undergone independent evolution , which leads to the disengagement of GSDME from the substrate relationship with CASP7 . Another physiological consequence is that GSDME activation

To investigate this question , Wang et al . used pufferfish , a species of fish , to study the role of CASP in the regulation of gasodermin E . The experiments showed that the CASP1/4 protein , known as CASP5 , was cleavesd by both puffers and humans . This was the first time that the two proteins were able to separate the residues that are present in the same residue . Wang , Liu ed . also found that the p10 subunit of the protein that controls the cleatability of the peptide , called p11 , is also involved in the recognition of a specific residue in the protein . These results suggest that the differences between the two groups of proteins may have been caused by mutations in the phosphate kinase ."

[ABSTRACT] We found that : ( i ) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional , reflecting robust inter-individual variability ; ( ii ) ketamine 's data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin ( SST ) and parvalbumin ( PVALB ) cortical gene expression patterns in humans , while the mean effect did not ; and ( iii ) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine , which were resolvable at the single-subject level . We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity and related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets . However , inter-individual variability in response to ketamine is still not well understood and it is unclear how ketamine 's molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects . These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine . They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry .

[DISCUSSION] A third possibility is that the multiple bi-directional PCs may be driven by ketamine 's numerous microcircuit level targets , as ketamine effects : ( i ) SST interneurons , which in turn disinhibit glutamatergic pyramidal distal dendrites and PVALB interneurons ; ( ii ) PVALB interneurons , which disinhibit the soma of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons ; ( iii ) VIP neurons , which may reduce distal dendrite inhibition but disinhibit SST activity ; and ( iv ) chandelier cells , which permit the back-propagation of action potentials from the axon to the soma Anderson et al. , 2020 . Furthermore , we demonstrated that neuro-behavioral PC1 captured individual variation in how SST and PVALB interneurons may be differentially impacted by ketamine : we found an association between participants ' neuro-behavioral PC1 scores and whether their Δ GBC maps positively correlated with SST cortical gene expression maps and negatively correlated with PVALB cortical gene expression maps ( seen in 58 % of participants ) , or whether they showed the reverse pattern ( seen in 12 % of participants ) ( Figure 6H ) . We address this knowledge gap by : ( i ) showing there is robust inter-individual variability in both the behavioral and neural response to ketamine that requires a multi-dimensional analytic approach ; and ( ii ) providing a multi-dimensional framework with which to connect across ketamine 's behavioral , neural and molecular effects that is resolvable at the single subject level . Meanwhile , the bi-drectional nature of the principal components may relate to individual differences in a number of factors including use-dependent excitation of NMDA networks , genetic variation in NMDA receptor subunits , and sleep profiles MacDonald et al. , 1987 ; Xu and Lipsky , 2015 ; De Vry and Jentzsch , 2003 ; Duncan et al. , 2013 . In addition , ketamine 's multi-dimensional neural effects may be due to complementary inhibitory and excitatory dimensions which are not present to the same extent with psilocybin and LSD : both psilocybin and LSD are excitatory while ketamine results in increased excitation indirectly as a consequence of the inhibition of interneurons . A larger sample size would also allow us to investigate alternative models for ketamine 's molecular mechanisms in addition to the indirect hypothesis , such as how ketamine 's effects may differ based on NMAR subtypes or excitatory vs. inhibitory synapses . For example , following ketamine high positive PC1 Δ GBC loaders exhibit increased GBC in association networks such as the default mode network and decreased GBC in sensory cortices such as the secondary visual network ( i. e. subject 28 in Figure 6-figure supplement 3H ) , while high negative PC1 Δ GBC loaders show the reverse pattern ( i. e. subject 32 in Figure 6-figure supplement 4B ) . Interpreting this finding is of particular interest given that ketamine is a molecule that acts at the same target in every human brain , antagonising the NMDA receptor , which should intuitively result in a single uni-directional principal component ( PC ) . Overall , this is an important intuition , as the identification of the targets responsible for the different behavioral effects of ketamine seen in specific individuals is critical for the development of novel pharmaco-therapies that may lack the side effects of ketamine or reduce the abuse potential . Furthermore , given the differences in effective dimensionality we see across different drugs , an important future direction will

Ketamine , a drug that has been used to treat depression for decades , has been shown to have a number of side effects , including severe headaches . However , it is still unclear how ketamine affects the brain , and how it affects other parts of the body , such as the heart , stomach , liver , or kidney . It is also unclear how different types of brain cells work together to control how much a person suffers from a particular disease . The brain is made up of neurons called neurons , which are connected to each other by a network of neurons . These neurons communicate with each other in a way that allows them to sense each other’s movements and reactions . This information is then relayed to other neurons in the brain to help them to respond to the medication . Researchers have been trying to understand how the effects of this drug affect the brain and how they affect the body’s ability to respond . Now , Wang et al . have used a new technique called MRI to study the brain’s response to a combination of drugs . In the experiments , participants were given a dose of the drug and were given an injection . They were asked to identify the brain regions that were affected by the drug in their brains , as well as the genes that regulate the activity of the brain cells involved in the reaction . Using this technique , the researchers found that the brains of the participants had different levels of activity compared to those of the controls .

[ABSTRACT] We find that large population sizes and small differences in the replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species ( 'genes ' ) , while the error threshold problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification . Stochastic parabolic growth could thus have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes . In addition , sequence properties ( GC content ) and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants , suggesting that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation . Here , we test the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under the constraints of constant total population size and chemostat conditions . The RNA world hypothesis proposes that during the early evolution of life , primordial genomes of the first self-propagating evolutionary units existed in the form of RNA-like polymers . Autonomous , non-enzymatic , and sustained replication of such information carriers presents a problem , because product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication speed . Kinetics of growth is then parabolic with the benefit of entailing competitive coexistence , thereby maintaining diversity .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Such studies may help gain a deeper insight into the question whether the emergence of an effective strand separation mechanism , or other conditions implying kinetic constants that shift the dynamics toward exponential amplification , allowed for a still sub-exponential diversity-maintaining mechanism during later phases of chemical evolution and thus a gradual evolutionary transition from non-enzymatic replication to ribozyme-aided amplification . As we have demonstrated , template-directed , non-enzymatic replication of oligomer modules leading to parabolic growth profiles is an effective genetic information maintaining mechanism which may thus have constituted an indispensable bridge from the very first abiotic synthetic pathways for RNA to a ribozyme-dominated stage of the RNA world . Although short oligonucleotides like those we have investigated in the present study are not characteristically prone to intramolecular 2D folding and therefore typically bear with limited catalytic activities , miniribozymes with surprisingly short sequence lengths can still catalyze a wide variety of chemical reactions . Referring to the chemostat model , we propose that a periodically changing environment with alternating resource abundance and shortage can drive , and in the distant past could have driven , an efficient evolutionary exploration-exploitation algorithm . Moreover , this view does not exclude the possibility of the existence of a pre-RNA world , in which genetic information resided in polymer structures similar to RNA , such as peptide or tetrose nucleic acids . Considering that we applied a rather broad approach to replicator representation we believe that the results of the present model are general enough for being naturally applicable to pre-RNA systems as well . Therefore , catalytic aid and/or metabolic cooperation among independently replicating sequences can considerably broaden the parameter space in which we reported competitive coexistence of different replicator variants . It is , however , noteworthy that besides the 'information first ' view of the RNA world hypothesis , there are other concepts as to how life arose ; e. g. , the 'metabolism first ' or autotrophic origins view . 5 < p < 1 interval are expected to show that an increase in the kinetic growth order decreases the scope of competitive coexistence and drives the system more toward the Darwinian regime . The demonstrated diversity-maintaining mechanism of finite parabolic populations can be used as a plug-in model to investigate the coevolution of naked and encapsulated molecular replicators . If diversity decreases too fast under selection , this can lead to premature convergence , resulting in a population getting stuck at a local adaptive peak . We call attention to the fact that parabolic growth is an organic form of diversity maintenance . In order to avoid premature convergence , various diversity-maintaining mechanisms have been introduced . The two key components of evolutionary algorithms are exploration and exploitation . In this study we considered kinetic constants that correspond to the p≈0 . Further investigations into the 0 . 5 growth order .
[METHODS] ",,732,85,None,"RNA is a type of protein that can be used to make proteins . It is made up of a series of strands of DNA , each of which contains a single molecule called RNA .

However , it is not clear how these RNA-like polymers evolved , or how they evolved .

[ABSTRACT] Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites , and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1 . Here , we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 ( TRMT1 ) , a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs . These findings provide evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection . The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells . Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications , consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5 . Nonstructural protein 5 ( Nsp5 ) is the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication . Compared to wild-type human cells , TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The packaging of specific tRNAs in viral particles could augment viral translation in the subsequent round of infection , thereby enhancing infectivity and perhaps facilitating the species jump of SARS-CoV-2 towards hosts with incompatible codon bias . Our findings suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 might self-limit its replication by altering the host translation machinery through TRMT1 degradation and reduced levels of m2 , 2G-modified tRNAs . This perturbation of the tRNA pool may further inhibit host translation that is already targeted by Nsp1 blockade of mRNA entry on 40 S ribosomes . The observation that expression of the non-cleavable TRMT1-Q530N variant enhances viral replication and infectivity supports the hypothesis that TRMT1 could facilitate tRNA uptake into viral particles . The inhibition of host translation may be beneficial to certain viruses that can locally maintain a tRNA pool optimized for viral translation . Another possibility is that Nsp5-TRMT1 interaction facilitates the packaging of specific tRNAs into viral particles as suggested previously .

The virus can also infect other animals , such as humans , animals and plants . However , the virus cannot replicate in the host , so the virus must be able to replicate in other cells . To do this , a protein called nonstructural protein 5 ( Nsp5 ) binds to the viral protein and cleaves it into a small protein called tRNA methyltransferase 1 ( TRMT1 ) that is needed for the virus to replicate . This protein is essential for the replication of the virus , and it has been suggested that Nspp5 could be involved in this process . Now , Liu et al . have found that the protein , known as Nsq5 , can cleave the protein of TRMT-1 . Using a technique called X-ray crystallography , they show that the proteins of the protein are cleaked at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of the proteins .

[ABSTRACT] One hypothesis posits that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence , or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host . The existence of microbes whose life cycle does not require a host and are not normally pathogenic , yet are well-suited to host exploitation , is an evolutionary puzzle . Along with plastic adherence , two multicellular phenotypes- biofilm formation and flor formation- increased ; another phenotype , pseudohyphal growth , responded to the nutrient limitation . To experimentally test the idea of 'accidental virulence ' , replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evolved to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations . Our results support the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic , 'accidental ' pathogens . Wax moth larvae injected with evolved hyper-multicellular strains were significantly more likely to die than those injected with evolved non-multicellular strains . Many disease-causing microbes are not obligate pathogens ; rather , they are environmental microbes taking advantage of an ecological opportunity . Hence , selection on plastic adherence incidentally led to the evolution of enhanced multicellularity and increased virulence . Thus , experimental selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent , hyper-multicellular strains . An example of such a trait is surface adherence .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Warmer water temperatures and climate disruptions have been linked to the incidence of illness caused by the marine bacterium Vibrio vulnificus , and an increase in global temperature has been hypothesized to be related to the simultaneous emergence of C. auris infections on multiple continents . Furthermore , in its long evolutionary history , S. cerevisiae has evolved the genetic capability to express multiple different multicellular phenotypes , most of which are induced in nutrient limiting conditions ; the experiment presented here was performed in such conditions ( glucose limited medium ) . Clinically relevant strains of Escherichia coli can use microplastics in the environment as a reservoir and can even become more virulent after recovery from the 'plastisphere ' , and it has been shown that plastics in the environment may harbor other pathogenic taxa . Previous research on a panel of environmental isolates found no correlation between the phenotypes assayed here , and in a tractable lab strain capable of aggregative behaviors , each phenotype was associated with its own set of genes . As humans continue to generate novel ecological niches at an unprecedented rate by encroaching on more habitats , using plastics unreservedly , and especially , as the global climate changes , the potential for unintended selection grows . In the case of the filamentous phenotypes assayed here , a genetic background that contains variants in the main signaling pathways may lead to a correlation of the phenotypes , while variants expressed later in the development of the phenotype , that are specific to a single trait , may not lead to such a correlation . Furthermore , nutrient limiting conditions may have affected PSH in our experiment , but it was not the main driver of the other multicellular phenotypes ; rather , it was adherence selection that led to the evolution of hyper-multicellularity . In 2022 , the World Health Organization issued its first-ever report prioritizing 19 fungal pathogens for research and public health awareness ; of these , 11 are known to live in the environment ( i. e. soil , wood , etc . Regardless of the specific trait causing increased virulence , the experiment demonstrated that selection for a dual-use trait in an environment that is entirely devoid of host organisms can still inadvertently lead to virulence and pathogenicity . Our results demonstrate that selection on one yeast trait can generate a correlated response in other traits- a common feature of organismal evolution - but here , the correlated traits may have included those associated with virulence . Despite the phenotypes being induced by different nutrient signals , there are numerous conserved signaling pathways contributing to filamentous , multicellular growth of all forms ( e. g. cAMP-PKA , TOR , filamentous MAPK , Rim101 ) . However , harsh environmental conditions can also favor traits that favor the collective , or multicellular phenotypes , so it is perhaps not surprising that other forms of multicellularity increased throughout this experiment . In this experiment , favoring the ability to adhere to plastic , a surface that is common in industrial , medical , and domestic settings , led to a suite of aggregative phenotypes and increased virulence . The effect of the different types of genetic variants suggests that some strains and genetic backgrounds are more likely to evolve virulence from selection in the open environment . More generally , the narrowing of the gap between mammalian body temperatures and the ambient environment may create opportunities for fungi to exploit new host niches . Thus , as new selective pressures act on populations with existing abundant genetic variation , there is the opportunity to coincidentally select a new generation of accidental pathogens . Future research will investigate the sorting of the genetic variation , as well as the new mutations , that led to the observed phenotypic evolution in these

[ABSTRACT] Here , we exploit the accuracy of our residue-resolution coarse-grained model , Mpipi , to quantify the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins ( hnRNPA1 , TDP43 , FUS , EWSR1 , RBM14 , and TIA1 ) . These rules are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend across the entire family tested , suggesting that scaling laws can be used as tools to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates . Proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains ( PLDs ) are common drivers of the formation of biomolecular condensates and are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations . Our simulations reveal the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations . Our work offers a quantitative lens into how the emergent behavior of PLD solutions vary in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This relationship implies that each mutation of Arg to Lys exerts a substantially more destabilizing effect than mutations of Arg to other uncharged , non-aromatic residues , consistent with experimental evidence and highlighting the significant , modulatory role Lys plays in the phase behavior of PLDs . The scaling law for such aromatic deletions ( 56K/L ) predicts that the destabilizing effect of replacing an aromatic with a non-aromatic residue is linearly amplified by the number of such mutations and screened by the square root of the length of the protein ( L ) , indicating a disruption in the percolated network of interactions sustaining the condensate . In this study , we exploit the accuracy and efficiency of our protein model , Mpipi , to compute and analyze the temperature-vs-density phase diagrams of a large set of PLDs-140 variants of the PLDs of proteins hnRNPA1 , TDP43 , FUS , EWSR1 , RBM14 , and TIA1 . While it may seem counterintuitive for Arg deletions to have a lesser effect in the critical parameters of longer PLDs than their aromatic counterparts , an explanation lies in the type of systems in question , which are particularly rich in aromatic residues . For instance , modern residue-resolution protein coarse-grained models can now be used to quantify the modulation of protein phase behavior as a result of amino acid sequence mutations of their native proteins with near-quantitative agreement with experiments . This code not only allows for testing the effects of composition bias on PLD phase separation but also serves as a predictive tool , allowing for a better selection of mutations to achieve desired changes in different condensates . Collectively , our set of phase diagrams reveals conserved scaling laws that quantitatively predict the change in the critical solution temperatures of single-component PLD solutions as a function of the number and type of amino acid mutations of the PLDs . In other words , longer PLDs are higher valency molecules than their shorter counterparts and can , thus , form a densely connected condensed-liquid network , even when a few of their aromatic stickers have been deleted . This law is also inversely length-dependent , indicating that mutations on these amino acids affect interaction networks and that Asn to Gln mutations result in an increased propensity of the system to phase separate . This indicates that for long PLDs , the destabilizing effects due to Arg deletions are diminished when compared to aromatic deletions , while in shorter PLDs this trend is reversed with each Arg deletion exerting a more significant destabilizing effect than the aromatic deletions . The scaling law for Arg deletions ( 640K/L ) predicts that the destabilizing effect of an Arg mutation to an uncharged , non-aromatic residue is inversely proportional to the length of the protein ( L ) , as well as linear with respect to the number of mutations . To facilitate the interpretation of the scaling laws derived in our study , we have organized the data in Table 1 , which illustrates the effect of single point mutations on the critical solution temperatures of the family of PLDs , as a function of the PLD length . This study is focused on PLDs , but we hypothesize similar scaling behavior in other IDPs , with the laws having a dependence on the protein length that reflects the nature of the underlying interaction networks of the system . Such laws are cumulative , meaning that the effects of successive mutations can be predicted by the addition of the appropriate laws , as long as the resulting mutation keeps within PLD composition and patterning biases . These deficiencies imply that the model might not accurately predict the effects of mutations in particular sequences , such as sequences high in proline or aliphatic residues , where the interaction landscape is temperature sensitive . Concretely , mutations of Arg residues to Lys result in an overall decrease in the critical temperature of phase separation , twofold in comparison
[METHODS] ",,875,92,None,"Proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains ( PLDs ) are known to be important for the formation of molecules called condenses . These molecules are made up of a series of amino acids that are arranged in a complex network . Each of these amino acids can change the shape of the condensate , which can lead to changes in the stability of the protein . However , it is not clear how these changes affect the stability and stability of these proteins . To answer this question , Wang et al . used a computational model to study how the stability or stability of PLD proteins change over time . The model was then used to predict the temperature of the solution of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins , including proteins hnRNPA1 , TDP43 , FUS , EWSR1 and TIA1 . This revealed that mutations in the amino acid sequences of the proteins affected the stability , but not the temperature , of the final solution . Wang also found that the number of amino acid mutations , as well as the type of mutation , could affect how the protein behaves in response to the change in the temperature or temperature . In addition , the model predicted that if a protein had more than 140 amino acids in its residue , its stability would be more stable . Furthermore , if there were more amino acid substitutions in its amino acid residues than if it had been deleted , this would cause the protein to lose its stability .

[ABSTRACT] We here propose an approach that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) and combines it with the Fisher kernel , which can be used to predict individual traits . One reason why these dynamic patterns are not usually considered is that they have to be described by complex , high-dimensional models ; and it is unclear how best to use these models for prediction . Our approach leverages information about an individual 's time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalised medicine . This is commonly done using either structural aspects , such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness , or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time . But these approaches are missing a central aspect of brain function : the unique ways in which an individual 's brain activity unfolds over time . We compare the Fisher kernel to other prediction methods , both time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models . Predicting an individual 's cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience . We show here , in fMRI data , that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach is accurate and reliable . The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner , thereby preserving the structure of the underlying model .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The fMRI dataset we used is a large sample taken from a healthy , young population , and it remains to be shown how the exhibited performance generalises to other datasets , for example other modalities such as EEG/MEG , clinical data , older populations , different data quality , or smaller sample sizes both in terms of the number of participants and the scanning duration . Here , improving the description of individual variability in brain measures may have potential benefits for a variety of clinical goals , for example to diagnose or predict individual patients ' outcomes , find biomarkers , or to deepen our understanding of changes in the brain related to treatment responses like drugs or non-pharmacological therapies . Our proposed approach provides one avenue of addressing this by leveraging individual patterns of time-varying amplitude and FC , as one of many possible descriptions of brain dynamics , and it can be flexibly modified or extended to include , for example information about temporally recurring frequency patterns . Additionally , we only tested our approach for the prediction of a specific set of demographic items and cognitive scores ; it may be interesting to test the framework also on clinical variables , such as the presence of a disease or the response to pharmacological treatment . We here showed that taking the structure of the underlying model or predictors into account , and thoroughly assessing not only accuracy but also errors and robustness , we can reliably use information from brain dynamics to predict individual traits . While we here tested robustness in terms of susceptibility to changes in CV folds , it remains to be shown to what extent model performance is sensitive to the random initialisation of the HMM , which affects the parameter estimation . The linear Fisher kernel had an overall higher prediction accuracy than all other time-varying methods and several time-averaged methods , though most comparisons were not statistically significant given the narrow margin for improvements . As we demonstrated in this work , there can be extreme errors and large variation in some predictive models , and these issues are not resolved by estimating model performance in a standard cross-validated fashion . However , since the Fisher kernel defines individuals in reference to the group-level model , we showed in simulations that separating training and test subjects prior to fitting the HMM may result in biased kernels that overestimate dissimilarity of the test subjects . We here aimed to show the potential of the HMM-Fisher kernel approach to leverage information from patterns of brain dynamics to predict individual traits in an example fMRI dataset as well as simulated data . While directly combining the features from each modality can be problematic , modality-specific kernels , such as the Fisher kernel for time-varying amplitude and/or FC , can be easily combined using approaches such as stacking or Multi Kernel Learning . While this could be a disadvantage if a trait was more closely related to how an individual transitions between brain states , we found that this was not the case in any of the traits we tested here . This is an important consideration as it may affect studies with small sample sizes and with heterogeneous training and test sets ( e. g. where a researcher may want to fit a model to healthy controls and subsequently test it on patients ) . Like in the time-varying methods , working in Riemannian space also improved prediction for the time-averaged methods , indicating that respecting the geometry of the space that the predictors lie on is an important factor for predictive modelling in neuroscience . We compared the Fisher kernel to kernels which ignore the structure of the brain dynamics model ( 'naïve ' kernels ) , to a previously used method based on Kullback-Leibler
[METHODS] ",,905,94,None,"The brain is made up of many different parts , including the brain’s structure , the brain's connectivity , and the ability of the brain to respond to changes in the environment . The brain also has a number of different types of connections , such as how the brain works , how it interacts with other parts of the body , or how it moves around . However , it is not clear how these connections are described . For example , a person’s brain activity can vary over time , but it is difficult to predict how much each individual’s activity changes over the course of a lifetime . One way to describe this is to use a mathematical model called the Hidden Markov model . This model describes how an individual’d brain activity changes in time . It is often used to predict the brain activity of people , for example if they have been diagnosed with a disease . But it is unclear how best to use this model to predict individual traits .

[ABSTRACT] While it has been recently shown that perturbations in cellular homeostasis including lysosomal damage can increase LRRK2 activity and localization to lysosomes , the molecular mechanisms by which LRRK2 activity is regulated have remained poorly defined . Together , these data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12 , in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants , facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrate ( s ) at the lysosome . Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes , we demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes and leads to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation . PD-linked variants , including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N , lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10 . We performed a targeted siRNA screen to identify regulators of LRRK2 activity and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates , Rab10 . Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) variants associated with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and Crohn 's disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] LRRK2 activation in the face of minor or acute lysosomal insults likely plays a beneficial role in maintaining lysosomal function , while chronic LRRK2 activation triggered by genetic variants with increased kinase activity or low-level lysosomal damage over time may ultimately impair the ability to effectively respond to membrane stress and maintain the balance between lysosomal repair and destruction . We can not rule out the possibility that additional mechanisms beyond increased proximity between LRRK2 and its Rab substrates may contribute to Rab10 phosphorylation following lysosomal damage , as the magnitude of change in Rab10 phosphorylation induced by LLOMe treatment was greater than the extent of LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes . Additional studies suggested that LRRK2 hyperactivation triggers mechanisms aimed at clearing cargo from damaged lysosomes that have lost their proteolytic capacity , either through direct exocytosis of lysosomes or through a novel sorting process termed LYTL ( lysosomal tubulation/sorting driven by LRRK2 ) in which tubules bud off from lysosomes following membrane rupture . Our results suggest that these variants may also promote LRRK2 activation by increasing Rab12-mediated LRRK2 localization to lysosomes , implying this may represent a general mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is increased by various genetic variants and environmental stressors associated with PD . Additional studies are warranted to determine how lysosomal membrane rupture triggers Rab12 recruitment , to identify other regulatory processes that may contribute to Rab phosphorylation upon lysosomal damage , and to better define how broadly such mechanisms are employed to drive LRRK2 activation in PD . Increased LRRK2 kinase activity is observed with pathogenic PD-linked variants and in sporadic PD patients , but many questions remain regarding the mechanisms by which LRRK2 activation is regulated basally and in response to endolysosomal stress associated with disease . While the purpose of LRRK2 recruitment and activation on lysosomes is poorly defined , several hypotheses have been proposed suggesting that LRRK2 activity may be upregulated as a compensatory response to restore lysosomal homeostasis following damage . As our work focused on the role of Rab12 in A549 cells , it will also be important to understand whether Rab12 similarly regulates LRRK2 activation and localization to damaged lysosomes in other cell types . Macrophages from PD patients carrying pathogenic LRRK2 variants were shown to accumulate more damaged lysosomes compared to samples from healthy controls , suggesting that mechanisms that respond to and repair lysosomal membrane rupture may be perturbed in PD . Previous studies suggested that another LRRK2 substrate , Rab29 , can regulate LRRK2 's kinase activity and showed that exogenously expressed Rab29 is capable of activating LRRK2 at the trans-Golgi or at additional membranes when artificially anchored there . Previous work supports a model in which LRRK2 activity controls the decision to repair minor damage to lysosomal membranes through an ESCRT-mediated process or to target damaged lysosomes for degradation via lysophagy . We propose a model in which Rab12 recruits LRRK2 to the lysosome and enhances its activity on lysosomal membranes by increasing LRRK2 's local concentration near Rab10 and potentially other Rab substrates ( Figure 4E ) . A deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which LRRK2 responds to lysosomal damage and how these contribute to PD pathogenesis is critical in guiding new potential therapeutic strategies targeting LRRK2 for the treatment of PD . Here , we used endogenous expression conditions to demonstrate that Rab12 , but not Rab29 , regulates LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and that Rab12 regulates the localization and activation of LRRK2 on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress . A recent CRISPR-based genome-wide screen for modifiers of Rab10 phosphorylation also identified RAB12 as a top hit , providing additional validation that Rab12 is a key regulator of LRRK2 activation . The PD-linked pathogenic LRRK2 variant R1441G , which lies outside of LRRK2 's kinase domain , and the VPS35 D620N variant have been shown in previous studies and confirmed here to increase LRRK2 activity . Our findings provide key insight
[METHODS] ",,888,93,None,"Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is caused by mutations in the gene for Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) , which is involved in repairing damaged lysosomes . The mutations cause the cell to lose its ability to properly repair damaged cells . However , it is not clear how LLRK2 is regulated . In PD patients , the protein called Rab10 is phosphorylated , a protein that is found in the cytoplasm of the cell . It is also known to play a role in the repair of damaged cells by releasing a chemical called leucine into the cell’s membrane . This reaction is known as LYTL , and it is thought that this reaction is triggered by a mutation in the protein , Rab12 , that causes the protein to bind to Rab10 . Previous studies have shown that Rab12 is a key regulator of LRRk2 activity , but it was not clear whether it is also involved in other diseases . Now , Liu et al . have used a technique called RNA sequencing to identify the genes that regulate Rab12 in PD and Crohn's disease patients . To do this , they used RNA molecules that were extracted from the cells of patients with PD or Crohn’s Disease . These proteins were then analyzed to determine whether Rab12 was involved in the process of lysolination . Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods , these experiments showed that Rab-12 is recruited to damaged LYSOsomes and increases the levels of Rab10 in the cells , leading to a higher level of Rab11 . Further experiments revealed that the protein Rab12 plays a critical role in lysomal repair"

[ABSTRACT] In this study , we addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment , the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 sensor , an automated image analysis pipeline , and a custom machine learning algorithm . This method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1 , which have unique cell cycle characteristics , and we tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells . Our cell cycle analysis system , which is also compatible with adherent cells , is fully automated and freely available , providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions . This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive , automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells . While current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells , non-adherent cells remain challenging . Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research . This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The described work allows researchers in the field to analyze thousands of ( non- ) adherent cells per each experimental condition by using the image and data analysis pipelines to automatically perform image processing , cell tracking , filtering of incorrect tracks , and cell cycle phases identification and characterization . These range from creating custom supports to confine cell movement within a restricted region enabling extended imaging periods of up to 40 hr , to partially immobilizing cells using substances like gelatin or low-melting-point agarose . The capability to track non-adherent cells for up to 72 hr ( almost equivalent to three complete cell cycles in NB4 cells ) was achieved by employing SBS-coated glass in combination with the addition of MC to the culture medium . The seeding protocol could also certainly be extended to other types of live-cell imaging experiments , especially when the fluorescence intensity can be monitored for shorter durations , thereby circumventing the need for the addition of MC . In the last few years , efforts have been made to simplify the cell cycle assessment relying on FUCCI technology , resulting in the development and public availability of software tools and ImageJ plugins . This entire analysis process took approximately 2 hr of human involvement , for a total execution time that ranges from 12 to 48 hr , depending on dataset size , that is commissioned to a machine ( Figure 5 ) . However , all these methods require human intervention at different points in the analysis workflow , such as the initial selection of cells for analysis or the manual correction of inaccurate tracks during the analysis . In conclusion , we confirm the efficiency of the optimized conditions in immobilizing the non-adherent cells for long time periods , without affecting their predicted response upon different environmental circumstances . This not only streamlines the cell cycle analysis of cells expressing the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 indicator , but also makes it accessible to researchers with basic programming knowledge . This is based on the principle that cell adhesion on SBS is facilitated by the nanostructure 's ability to engage with integrins , which are widely expressed in diverse cell types . In this report , we describe a complete protocol for the cell cycle analysis of adherent and non-adherent cells expressing the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 technology in a fully automated manner . Moreover , the set-up pipeline makes possible the quantification of potentially thousands of cells in an automated fashion relying on the crucial contribution of a machine learning algorithm . As a second quality check step , we decided to treat the relatively fast-cycling NB4 cells with suboptimal concentrations of three different CDK inhibitors . We successfully emphasized alterations of few hours in the duration of cell cycle phases when NB4 cells were subjected to exceedingly low concentrations of inhibitors . MC was necessary to limit the movement of single cells or cell clusters after more than 24 hr of observation ( Videos 1 and 5 ) . It should be taken into consideration that the manual correction of incorrect tracks takes approximately 2 hr per field of view ( FOV ) . It was applied to the analysis of the cell cycle phases of two different AML cell lines , NB4 and Kasumi-1 , which have different durations . Not only the suggested protocol makes these experiments doable , but also the experimental set-up can be scaled up according to the experimental needs . Hence , in the reported experiments of this study , the analysis of a single well would take about 40-50 hr of manual work . We deduce that this seeding protocol has the potential to be effectively employed with various non-adherent cell types . Moreover , the image and data analysis pipelines can be easily applied to adherent cells , as shown in Figure 3-figure supplement 1 . The presented image and data analysis workflows rely on two different software
[METHODS] ",,883,93,None,"The cell cycle is a complex process that involves the movement of cells from one cell to the next . This process is known as the cell cycle , or cell division . Cells that are adherent to one another are called non-adherent cells . However , it is not clear how these cells are related to each other . To understand how cells behave , researchers need to understand how the cells move . One way to do this is to use fluorescent markers to measure the length of the cell’s cycle . These markers can be used to measure how long the cells are moving , and they can also help scientists to identify the cells that are not adhesing to each others . In addition , fluorescent markers can also be used in cancer research , where they can help to identify cancer cells that do not have adhesion . Now , Wang et al . have developed a new method that allows researchers to analyze thousands of non-attached cells in a single day . The method uses a special surface that allows the cells to be attached to the surface , which is made of a material called SBS . It is then used to track the cells’ movements , as well as to determine how long it takes them to complete the cycle of cell division in non-accidental cells , such as those that are infected with cancer . Using this method , Zhang eT . found that the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 sensor can be applied to hundreds of cells in different conditions . For example , if the cells were exposed to a high concentration of CDK inhibitors , the cells would be able to move for up to 72 hours . Furthermore , when the cells had been exposed to the inhibitors for more than 24 hours , they would be more likely to move"

[ABSTRACT] Using brain imaging data from 16 primate species , we measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions , the frontal pole ( FP ) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , respectively , involved in metacognition and working memory , and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables . The size of these prefrontal regions , as well as the whole brain , was best explained by three variables : body mass , daily traveled distance ( an index of ecological constraints ) , and population density ( an index of social constraints ) . Thus , our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates . The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates . Interestingly , FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume , in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions . Recent comparative studies provided conflicting results regarding the contribution of social vs ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition . Here , we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology . The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains both a fascinating and a controversial issue .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Interestingly , the whole brain volume ( which is strongly correlated with both FP and DLPFC ) seems to show an intermediate tendency : even if the effect of population density appears smaller than that of daily traveled distance ( beta weight is one order of magnitude smaller ) , it is clearly significant , and the 'leave-one-out ' procedure indicated that it was only slightly less reliable than daily traveled distance , with a significant decrease in model fit quality for four vs one combination of species . In other words , the error with which these variables were estimated at the level of individual species was small enough to allow us to study the relation of interest across species , and from that perspective , there is no reason to exclude any species from that analysis and our sample appears reliable enough to characterize the relation between neuroanatomical features and socio-ecological variables across primates . Indeed , we acknowledge that since the definition of the regions of interest we used is based on gyri and sulci , it was therefore impossible to include lissencephalic primates in our sample , even if previous laboratory studies in marmosets could identify DLPFC and FP using both cytoarchitectonic and functional criteria . Thus , even if we make no strong claim regarding the specific boundaries of FP and DLPFC , the anatomo-functional difference between these regions , as characterized in a few species used in laboratory experiments , is reliable enough to be captured by the variability in socio-ecological variables in a larger set of primates . Of course , we would need to provide a clearer model regarding how facing socio-ecological challenges can rely upon specific and dynamic cognitive operations , but we believe that this is a critical first step that helps building a common theoretical framework to cross boundaries across behavioral ecology and cognitive neurosciences . But the contribution of the FP to metacognition and of the DLPFC to working memory is so strong and reliable in humans and laboratory primates that it seems reasonable to assume that , given the relative level of conservation of prefrontal cortex anatomical organization across primates , FP and DLPFC should also play a key role in metacognition and working memory in other primate species . At first sight , the very strong correlation between the volume of the whole brain and that of both FP and DLPFC implies that the specificity of the influence of socio-ecological factors on these prefrontal regions should be limited , and indeed , the variability of all three measures ( FP , DLPFC , and whole brain ) is predicted by the same model , i. e. , the same combination of socio-ecological variables . Thus , we acknowledge that intra-specific variability could introduce noise in the inter-specific relation between brain measures and socio-ecological variables , but the fact that clear relations could be established with our sample indicates that this source of intra-specific variability was limited enough relative to the inter-species relation between neuroanatomical measures and socio-ecological variables . In summary , even if we acknowledge that relative measures provide an index of the specificity of the relation between socio-ecological variables and regional brain volumes , we find relative measures much more difficult to interpret and we chose to use absolute measures of cerebral volumes to stay away from these considerations . Using that tool , we explored the relation between neuro-cognitive entities ( e. g. FP/metacognition vs DLPFC/working memory ) and socio-ecological variables , based on the assumption that the more a given cognitive function would be required to face a given socio-ecological challenge , the bigger the corresponding brain region would be . Critically , again , social and ecological functions are tightly intermingled in primates ' natural environment and more specific studies would be needed to

These regions are involved in a number of different processes , including thinking , thinking and working memory . However , it is not clear how these regions are related to each other . For example , some of these regions may be involved in learning , while others may be associated with working memory or metacognition . In this study , researchers used brain imaging data from 16 primate species to study the size of two regions of the brain . The frontal Pole and the Dorsotrop are two regions in the brain that are important for working memory in primates . Both regions have a similar size , but differ in how they work together . This suggests that both regions play a key role in working memory and metacerebral memory , and that they also play an important role in foraging . It is also possible that these regions might be involved more in social interactions , such as when people interact with each other than in other animals . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a combination of brain imaging and behavioral neuroscience to measure the size and shape of the two regions . They found that the frontant pole and Dorrosop are important in both working memory as well as metaceretics , which is important for foraging in humans . Wang also showed that the size differences between these regions could be explained by three factors: body mass , daily traveled distance and population density .

[ABSTRACT] After extensively validating the automated measurements , we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis . Collectively , the outcomes of this study offer insight into a fundamentally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it . Electron microscopy ( EM ) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question , but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process . Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils , but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils ( i. e. myofibril hypertrophy ) and/or the number of myofibrils ( i. e. myofibrillogenesis ) is not known . Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast , and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number . An increase in mechanical loading , such as that which occurs during resistance exercise , induces radial growth of muscle fibers ( i. e. an increase in cross-sectional area ) . To overcome this , we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope ( fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution [ FIM-ID ] ) .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] With the use of FIM-ID , the pursuit of such studies would be a feasible endeavor and the resulting data would not only help to resolve whether myofibril hypertrophy contributes to the radial growth response , but it would also provide insight into whether myofibril hypertrophy precedes the onset of myofibrillogenesis as predicted by the myofibril splitting model . With the development of our method , we were able to gain insight into whether the radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis . Importantly , these pipelines were developed in a free open-source program ( CellProfiler ) , and our manuscript includes copies of the pipelines along with instructions and test images so that prospective users can easily employ them ( see Source code 1 ) . As illustrated throughout the study , the images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast , and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines that can perform automated measurements of myofibril size and myofibril number . Studies aimed at testing the validity of these models should lead to important advancements in the field , and with the advent of FIM-ID , such studies can now be performed in a time- and cost-effective manner . This is important because , according to Goldspink 's model of myofibril splitting , myofibril hypertrophy would only be detected during the early stages of the radial growth response ( i. e. before the induction of myofibril splitting which would lead to a reduction in the CSA of the involved myofibrils ) . Moreover , the bulk of the FIM-ID workflow utilizes common lab instruments , and essentially anyone who has access to a standard cryostat and a fluorescent microscope with a motorized Z-stage can perform it . Thus , to further address the role of myofibril hypertrophy , future studies should obtain data from muscles that are going through various stages of the radial growth response ( i. e. a time course ) . However , a significant increase in myofibril CSA ( i. e. myofibril hypertrophy ) was not consistently observed ( Figures 5-6 ) , and no significant correlation between the magnitude of the radial growth of the fibers and myofibril hypertrophy was detected in any of the fiber types that we examined ( Figure 5-figure supplement 1 , Figure 6-figure supplement 1 ) . Fortunately , deconvolution modules have become a commonly available add-on for commercial imaging platforms , and when not available , there are several open-source deconvolution algorithms that users could deploy . The mechanisms via which an increase in mechanical loading induces myofibrillogenesis are not known , but the groundwork for two different models has already been established . In our opinion , the concepts of myofibril splitting and de novo myofibrillogenesis are very intriguing , and we consider both models to be worthy of further investigation . These points , when coupled with the other data presented in Figures 5 and 6 , indicate that radial growth of the muscle fibers was largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis . Specifically , with de novo myofibrillogenesis , it is thought that new myofibrils are derived from nascent proteins and that these nascent proteins are assembled into new myofibrils via a three-step sequence of events . At face value , these results could be viewed as evidence that myofibril hypertrophy does not play a major role in the radial growth response . As mentioned several times , one possibility is that the induction of myofibrillogenesis is mediated by hypertrophy and subsequent splitting of the pre-existing myofibrils ( i. e. the myofibril splitting model ) . In contrast to the induction of myofibril hypertrophy , all the fiber types in this study that showed significant radial growth also showed a

One model showed that the muscles were growing faster , while the other showed that they were growing slower .

[ABSTRACT] These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased the release probability , which are gain-of-function features not found in Syt1 knockout ( KO ) neurons ; normalized mEPSC release rates were higher ( potency D166Y > V48F ) than in the Syt1 KO . The V48F and D166Y mutants ( with potency D166Y > V48F ) led to reduced readily releasable pool ( RRP ) size , due to increased spontaneous ( miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Current , mEPSC ) release and decreased priming rates . In contrast , the I67N mutant decreased mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes due to an increase in the height of the energy barrier for fusion , whereas the RRP size was unaffected . All three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and when expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons . We studied three mutations in SNAP25 that cause epileptic encephalopathy : V48F , and D166Y in the synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 ) -binding interface , and I67N , which destabilizes the SNARE complex . These mutations ( potency D166Y > V48F ) increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs , resulting in unregulated membrane fusion . Overall , pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion . This could be partly compensated by positive charges lowering the energy barrier . SNAP25 is one of three neuronal SNAREs driving synaptic vesicle exocytosis .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This can be explained by the different function of SNAP25 domains during fusion , where V48 and D166 help set up an arrested primed vesicle state by interacting with Syt1 , whereas I67 participates in the final conformational change , the 'stroke ' that leads to assembly of the C-terminal end of the complex and the linker domain . When combining the I67N with the 4K mutation , which introduces six extra positive fixed charges , we could place our data within the framework of our model for electrostatic triggering and show that the effect of charge per se is approximately the same in the I67N mutant as in the WT . Similarly , we recently showed by cryo-electron tomography that the 4K mutation , which increased the mEPSC frequency to ~30 Hz and had a reduced RRP caused a loss of synaptic vesicles tethered to the membrane with three tethers , which is the structural correlate of the RRP . However , when normalized to the RRP size , mEPSC frequencies were much higher in the V48F and the D166Y than in the Syt1 KO ( Figure 6D ) , and dual sucrose applications indicated a decrease in the amplitude of the sucrose-probed apparent energy barrier and increased release probability , features not found in the Syt1 KO . Work with single-molecular optical tweezers showed that the I67N mutation destabilizes the overall SNARE C-terminal and linker domain , which are supposed to deliver the power stroke for membrane fusion , by 14 kBT , which is substantially more . Using Arrhenius ' equation to convert fusion , priming and depriming rates to their respective energy barrier heights ( see Materials and methods for the assumptions behind this procedure ) , we can derive the energy landscape for fusion of the three mutants ( Figure 13A-D ) . This shows the multiple changes in the V48F and D166Y , which affect at least two different barriers ( priming and fusion , Figure 13A , B ) , leading to a complex phenotype , whereas for I67N the fusion barrier is primarily ( or solely ) affected ( Figure 13D ) . The D166Y and V48F mutations lead to increases in spontaneous release , and more asynchronous eEPSCs , consistent with their localization in the primary SNARE : Syt1 interface , and the demonstrated impaired Syt1 binding ( Figure 8B , C ) , see also Alten et al. , 2021 . Rescue of spontaneous release was completed by adding six positive charges , which is consistent with the idea that the assembly of the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex , which is compromised by I67N , works against the electrostatic energy barrier , which is affected by the SNARE surface charge . The fact that a similar effect on spontaneous fusion was seen in the assay with preformed t-SNAREs in the presence of complexin indicates that there is an assembly step , even in that assay , which can be sped up by the mutations . Nevertheless , the calculation of electrostatic ( Coulomb ) and van der Waals ( Lennard-Jonson , LJ ) interactions for residues 48-52 ( Figure 9-figure supplement 2D ) and residues 162-166 ( Figure 9-figure supplement 2E ) shows that for D166Y the interaction energy is substantially more negative . 75 M sucrose released an RRP of similar size in WT , I67N , and I67N + WT co-expressing cells , showing that the vesicle priming reaction is intact , but the vesicles face a larger fusion barrier ( Figure 11 ) . However , note that the AlphaFold prediction used as a starting point for these simulations is identical to the structure of SNAP25 in the assembled SNARE complex , whereas unassembled SNAP25 is likely less structured or unstructured .

[ABSTRACT] This affects men and women , and is robust to age , number of research outputs , and bibliometric measures where such data are available . We use data from 30 countries and find that the more women in a discipline , the lower quality the research in that discipline is evaluated to be and the lower the funding success rate is . Our work builds on others ' findings that women 's work is valued less , regardless of who performs that work .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] However , we do see that across all disciplines women have lower scores than men and this is more pronounced in female-dominated disciplines which is suggestive of gender bias but far from conclusive due to the many factors at play . But when we include discipline gender bias ( Figure 2C ) the picture is less clear suggesting that if we compare a man and a woman with the same number of outputs the person in the minority gender is likely to have a higher score . For research funding datasets ( ARC , CIHR , EIGE ) , quotas or pre-allocation of funds towards certain types of research ( e. g. public health funding increasing during the Covid pandemic ) could explain some of our findings . Although empirics are limited it has been seen that unconscious biases can affect common academic metrics and practices such as h-index , citation , authorship , and peer review , as well as hiring and progression . If local policy prioritises funding to Engineering and Physical Science , this could result in higher funding success rates in these areas ; although it could also result in these areas having more researchers and the success rate being unaffected . Research varies widely across disciplines from the quantitative 'hard sciences ' to the qualitative 'soft sciences ' but to categorise the efforts of whole disciplines as lower quality rather than different is an extreme step . For example , if the PBRF was dominated by individual bias this would manifest itself in Education having lower average scores than Physics but a woman in Education would have the same score as a woman in Physics on average . This could be due to cultural norms in these disciplines being driven by women who overall have fewer outputs ; or it could be that women are attracted to disciplines with lower publication norms . If these discipline-specific perceptions spill over into evaluations of research and funding applications , it could produce a gender-based discipline bias very similar to our findings . One possible explanation of our findings is simply that reviewers ( of research portfolios in NZ , and of research proposals in Australia , Canada , and the EU and UK ) are biased against women . But it is possible that the finding that research in female-dominated disciplines is evaluated as less good than research in male-dominated disciplines is an outcome of feminisation over time . Future research could include modelling of various 'levers of change ' that might serve to diminish , correct , or compensate for the gendered patterns observed . Our findings suggest that what is perceived as women 's research is valued less , whether it is a man or a woman doing the research and whether or not overt bias is to blame . Such a gendered pattern of pre-allocation suggests it would be more of a different mechanism for our findings , rather than an explanation of them . It is a possibility that discipline choice , as opposed to job choice , is at play here , where women choose to work in disciplines where research is seen as less good . Further , the bibliometric subnational dataset suggests that a man and a woman with the same number of outputs ( the best bibliometric predictor of score ) have the same expected score ( Figure 2B ) . Perceptions of excellence can correspond with an underrepresentation of women in certain disciplines , resulting in a higher perceived genius status for that discipline . To explore whether as a discipline feminised the evaluation of research quality in that discipline also changed , we would need extensive longitudinal data . This explanation also raises the question of why disciplines perceived as lower quality are more likely to be female-dominated . A simple explanation for our findings is that evaluations of research are biased but not against individuals as considered above earlier . We present two separate findings : gender balance of the discipline is strongly related to research quality evaluations and to funding success . Here , applications are scored independently and there are no pre-allocation decisions to value or fund one discipline over another . The PBRF datasets offer the most granular data and hence

These cells are made of molecules called proteins , which can be used to produce new proteins . However , these molecules are not all made of the same molecules , but rather are made from different parts of the body . This makes it difficult for scientists to study the differences between the different parts . For example , some scientists think that the work they do in a particular discipline is better than the work that is done in other disciplines . But this is not the case . In some studies , researchers have been able to find that women are more likely to be involved in research than men . One way to find out is to look at the number of people involved in the research . Many studies have shown that women have a higher rate of success in research compared to men , because they have less time to complete their work . Now , Liu et al . have used data from 30 countries to investigate this question . The results show that the more women are involved , the lower the quality of the research in that discipline is evaluated and the higher the funding success rate is . It is not clear how this bias affects women , or how it affects other disciplines such as engineering , physical science , mathematics , medicine , etc . . Further experiments are needed to investigate whether this bias is a result of feminisation . If this happens , it could lead to a reduction in the success rate of research in other areas ."

[ABSTRACT] By engineering the crRNA : tracrRNA interaction , we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions , as well as the chemically induced dimerization of protein domains , can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells . Additionally , we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors , potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit . Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits , whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA . Here , we demonstrate a strategy termed 'P3 editing ' , which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA . Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing , facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells . One of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs . Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits , processing information in a predictable manner within living cells . However , programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We have explored how modifying the crRNA and petracrRNA pair sequences can tune the efficiency-vs-specificity tradeoff , but alternative avenues to improvement ( e. g. better docking of RNA aptamers such as MS2 , BoxB , or PP7 by testing more linker sequences that place crRNA and petracrRNA for duplex formation ) may be more fruitful in terms of achieving high efficiency and specificity at once ( e. g. > 50 % editing in the setting of a specific protein-protein interaction , and < 1 % editing without it ) . Although various sensors of RNA or protein production have been developed , the readout is almost always in the form of luminescence or fluorescence , because microscopy- or flow-sorting-based detection methods are common modes of detection with high sensitivity , possibly overcoming low conversion efficiency by sensors as long as they have high specificity . In our view , there are four outstanding challenges for P3 editing to be broadly useful : evaluating additional cellular contexts , the method 's efficiency and specificity , understanding the limit of detectable protein-protein interactions , and the development of sensors compatible with multiplex P3 editing within the same cell . Because the input of P3 editing is at the protein level , one could also chain different sensors with protein outputs upstream , although the conversion efficiency and specificity may be compounded and result in higher noise in capturing signals through more relays . For example , one could imagine developing a P3 editing strategy to construct a sensor specific to a cell state and combine it with other molecular signal or lineage recording methods to reconstruct the past history of each cell . This affords the potential to recover measurements from much larger numbers of cells than would be possible with microscopy or flow , and moreover to co-assay other classes of information about each cell . Here , we demonstrated that specific RNA-RNA ( e. g. annealing of two sequences within crRNA and petracerRNA ) , RNA-protein ( e. g. MS2 : MCP and BoxB : LambdaN interactions ) , and protein-protein ( epitope : antibody or chemically induced dimerization ) interactions can be used to control genome editing . The protein-level input also circumvents a key shortcoming of existing signal-specific molecular recording systems , such as DOMINO , CAMERA , and ENGRAM , which are limited to recording signal-driven transcription of the gRNA and/or the genome editor . More orthogonal protein-RNA pairs need to be identified e. g. using a massively parallel platform and/or computational prediction to allow for large numbers of P3 sensors for different protein-protein interactions to be deployed within the same cell . Outputting molecular sensors to genome editing events may facilitate the design of such control structures , particularly as the range of cellular activities that can be programmed by genome editing is rapidly expanding . Assuming the genome editing complex formation is reversible , improving P3 editing efficiency may be able to capture different strengths of protein-protein interactions , although some interactions may be too transient to promote functional gRNA formation . Finally , the sensor elements in the P3 editing strategy are focused on engineering each CRISPR-gRNA while leaving the gene editor ( i. e. prime editor and base editor ) unaltered , potentially facilitating multiplex genome editing within the same cell . Overcoming these four challenges is necessary for P3 editing to be broadly useful for gating genome editing on physiological levels of specific protein-protein interactions in a multiplex fashion . On a related point , strategies such as DNA Typewriter can facilitate the time-resolved recording of the output of multiple sensors to a common location ( s ) in the genome . Second , both the efficiency and specificity of the P3 editing need to be improved before it can be used as a selective editing tool in model systems . First , we have thus
[METHODS] ",,893,93,None,"Cells are made up of many different types of cells , each of which has a specific set of genes . Each of these genes is expressed in a particular cell , and the genes that are expressed in each cell are regulated by a protein called CRISPR . The CRISR protein is a gene that is encoded by RNA molecules , which are then translated into proteins . This process is called genome editing . In humans , genome editing is used to control the expression of a target gene . However , it is not clear how this process is controlled . To address this question , Wang et al . have developed a strategy called ‘P3 editing’ , a technique that uses a combination of proteins and proteins to control genome editing in cells .

[ABSTRACT] Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) are potent activators of KCNQ1 channels and activate IKs channels by binding to two different sites , one in the voltage sensor domain - which shifts the voltage dependence to more negative voltages - and the other in the pore domain - which increases the maximal conductance of the channels ( Gmax ) . In addition , it is unclear why IKs channels have a very small single-channel conductance and a low open probability or whether PUFAs affect any of these properties of IKs channels . Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable , contributing to the low open probability , and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state . Mutations in IKs cause long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) , a syndrome with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG , which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death . One potential therapeutical intervention for LQTS is based on targeting IKs channels to restore channel function and/or the physiological QT interval . In cardiomyocytes , the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current ( IKs ) , pivotal during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential . However , the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the Gmax of the IKs channels is still poorly understood .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Note also the currents from KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels display little external K+ dependence ( a small inhibition in addition to what is expected from changes in driving force ) and that KCNQ1 channels are more strongly inhibited by high extracellular K+ concentrations in contrast to other Kv channels , such as Shaker K+ channels , which are inactivated more in low K+ . This difference in the stability of the aromatic cuff between Shaker and KCNQ1 might explain why the effect of PUFA on Gmax is large for KCNQ1 but not seen in Shaker even if the residues involved in the Gmax effect are conserved between these two channels . We hypothesize that those hydrogen bonds between W304-D317 and W305-Y315 and the proline interactions are likely absent in the non-conductive conformation of KCNQ1 , thereby generating the high number of empty sweeps in control conditions . We have here shown that the interaction at Site II also involves another residue , the aspartic acid 301 , as mutagenesis analysis revealed that the effect of Lin-Glycine on Gmax was abolished when the residue was substituted with a glutamic acid . However , we think it is the resting state of the VSD , and not the low K+ , that caused the non-conductive selectivity filter in the KCNQ1 structure because a KCNQ1 structure with VSD activated in the low K+ solution had a selectivity filter that was nearly identical to the KCNQ1 structure in high K+ with VSD activated ( except for fewer K+ ions in the filter in low K+ solutions ) . We here show that mutations of residues involved in these hydrogen bonds in the selectivity filter greatly reduce or abolish the Gmax effect of Lin-Glycine , as if Lin-Glycine increases the Gmax by stabilizing a conductive state of the selectivity filter through these hydrogen bonds . The mechanism of the voltage shift effects at Site I , where the PUFA head group electrostatically interacts with positively charged S4 residues and thereby facilitates channel activation , has been investigated in previous studies . To gain further insight into the molecular interactions that could underline the Gmax effect by PUFA binding to Site II , we used the latest KCNQ1 structure with the S4 segment in the resting state . Our studies suggest that the mechanism of PUFAs to increase KCNQ1/KCNE1 maximum conductance relies on the ability of PUFAs to favor the conductive conformation of the selectivity filter : PUFAs promote interactions between residues in the selectivity filter that stabilize the channel pore . Those residues delimit a small crevice that seems to change in size in different structures with S4 activated or resting ( Figure 3D-F ) and seem to affect PUFA 's ability to increase Gmax . In contrast , in KCNQ1 the proline is positioned a little further outward and away from the two tryptophan residues , thus generating a looser arrangement of the aromatic ring cuff ( Figure 4-figure supplement 3B ) . We have previously proposed models in which the effect of PUFAs on IKs channels involve the binding of PUFAs to two independent sites : one at the voltage sensor ( Site I ) and one at the pore domain ( Site II ) . We tested the hypothesis that the effect of Lin-Glycine involved conformational changes in the selectivity filter following PUFA binding to two residues K326 and D301 at the pore domain . We hypothesize that the binding of Lin-Glycine to K326 and D301 at Site II biases the transition toward the conductive conformation , thereby increasing the number of non-empty sweeps and increasing Gmax . The decrease in the latency to first opening is most likely due to the binding of Lin-Glycine to Site I at the VSD and related to the shift in voltage dependence caused by Lin-Glycine ( Figure 2-figure supplement 1
[METHODS] ",,907,94,None,"When a cell receives electrical signals from the outside world , it activates a series of channels called IKs . These channels control the flow of electrical signals to other cells in the body , and they are responsible for controlling the heartbeat . However , the mechanism by which these channels are activated is not well understood . The IK channels are a group of proteins that are involved in the repolarization of the heart . This process is known as the slow delayed-rectifier current ( IK ) , which is a type of electrical signal that is produced by the heart muscle . In the heart muscles , IK is activated by a small group of molecules called polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) that have been shown to be involved in this process . One of these molecules , a protein called KCNE1 , is involved in regulating the IK channel activity . It is thought that PUBAs are involved with this process and that they can activate the IQ channels , but it is not clear how these molecules work . To address this question , Weidman et al . used a technique called X-ray crystallography to study the effects of PUCAs on the IKK channels . Using this technique , we found that a PUMA protein called Lin-Glycine binds to two different sites in the KCNQ1 complex , one in the voltage sensor domain and the other at the pore domain . Both sites are located in the same region of the channel , where the voltage dependence shifts to more negative voltages , while the other site is located in an open-conductive state . Our results suggest that the PUNAs are important for this process to work , as they are"

[ABSTRACT] Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate phosphatase ( PDXP ) , an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate ( PLP ) , the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6 , may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies . Still , the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood , and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well . We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors . Using a combination of small-molecule screening , protein crystallography , and biolayer interferometry , we discover , visualize , and analyze 7 , 8-dihydroxyflavone ( 7 , 8-DHF ) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor . Our discovery of 7 , 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7 , 8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain . Of note , 7 , 8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models , although its mechanism of action is actively debated . Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades . 7 , 8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency . However , pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking . In mouse hippocampal neurons , 7 , 8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner . These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our observation that the expression of PDXP is substantially upregulated in hippocampi of middle-aged mice suggests that a therapeutic vitamin B6 supplementation alone may not suffice to elevate intracellular PLP levels under conditions where the PLP-degrading phosphatase is hyperactive . The identification of 7 , 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor reported here indicates that this flavone may modulate vitamin B6-dependent processes and suggests that PDXP could be explored as a pharmacological entry point into brain disorders . We also present three high-resolution 7 , 8-DHF/PDXP co-crystal structures that will facilitate the design of more potent , efficacious , and selective PDXP inhibitors in the future . Although PLP deficiency is thought to contribute to the respective human conditions , PLP-dependent processes have not yet been considered in the context of 7 , 8-DHF-induced effects . Using quantitative and direct assays to measure TrkB dimerization and activation , TrkB downstream signaling pathways , TrkB-dependent gene expression and cytoprotection , 7 , 8-DHF and other reported small-molecule TrkB agonists failed to activate TrkB in cells . Overall , it appears that the mechanism of action of 7 , 8-DHF is incompletely understood , but 7 , 8-DHF targets other than TrkB so far have remained elusive . Here , we identify 7 , 8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor that increases PLP levels in hippocampal neurons , validating PDXP as a druggable target to control intracellular PLP levels in the brain . Interestingly , numerous in vivo studies have reported the effectiveness of 7 , 8-DHF in brain disorder models , including rodent models of Alzheimer 's disease , depression , schizophrenia , epilepsy , and autism . An electrophysiological study in acute hippocampal slice preparations demonstrated that 7 , 8-DHF potentiates hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synaptic transmission in a TrkB receptor‐independent manner . Such molecules might improve the control of intracellular PLP levels and help to elucidate a possible contribution of PLP to the pathophysiology of brain disorders . Therapeutics that target BDNF/TrkB signaling are thus of interest as disease-modifying agents in several brain disorders . Since BDNF does not cross the blood-brain barrier , attempts have been made to develop small-molecule BDNF mimetics . PLP deficiency has been associated with human brain disorders for decades , yet causal links remain unclear . BDNF , a high-affinity TrkB ligand , is an important neuropeptide for nervous system function and pathology . Consensus is emerging that BDNF plays a key role in the treatment response to neuropsychiatric drugs . Aside from vitamin B6 administration , pharmacological strategies to elevate intracellular PLP levels are lacking . 7 , 8-DHF was initially discovered as a small-molecule TrkB agonist with BDNF-mimetic activity . Nevertheless , the on-target selectivity and efficacy of these compounds is actively debated . The discovery of 7 , 8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor was unexpected . Several candidates have been reported , including 7 , 8-DHF .

[ABSTRACT] We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4 , which possess mirror-symmetric orientation , is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins ( CWN-1 , CWN-2 , and EGL-20 ) with distinct functions . The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells ( DTCs ) , which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors ( SGPs ; Z1 and Z4 ) . In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1 , DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side . These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ . Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration . In lin-17 mutants , CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4 , while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4 , respectively . Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 ( RNAi ) animals producing ectopic DTCs . Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration . In contrast , EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4 . However , the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We have shown that Z1-derived DTC can migrate posteriorly in cki-1 ( RNAi ) as well as lin-17 ; egl-20 cwn-2 animals , indicating that ectopically positioned DTCs can mis-migrate passing through germ cells irrespective of mutations in Wnt signaling genes . We have previously shown that the polarity of seam cells ( V1-V5 ) is redundantly regulated by cwn-1 , cwn-2 , and egl-20 , indicating that all three of these Wnts induce the same polarity orientation ( HL for high-low POP-1 concentration ) . In seam cells , Wnt receptors including LIN-17/Fzd and MOM-5/Fzd appear to have Wnt-independent functions for cell polarization , as seam cells are still mostly polarized in the quintuple Wnt mutants , while they are strongly unpolarized in the triple receptor mutants ( lin-17 mom-5 cam-1/Ror ) . In Drosophila , Fz/Fzd has been primarily considered to function Wnt-independently to coordinate PCP between neighboring cells , though Fz function can still be regulated by Wnt , as PCP orientation can be directed by ectopically expressed Wnt proteins . Consequently , the regulation of SGP polarity by Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in ensuring normal DTC migration and mirror-symmetric organogenesis by positioning DTCs at the distal edge of the gonad . A similar antagonistic relationship between cwn-1 and egl-20 was reported for later DTC migration when DTCs turn to migrate centrally on the dorsal side ( phase III ) . Since these cells have asymmetry in terms of their contacts with germ cells on their proximal sides and those with the basement membrane on their distal sides , CWN-2 may permissively facilitate this asymmetry to control POP-1 localization . The results strongly suggest that DTCs at ectopic positions can self-migrate to the distal ends of the gonad , regardless of the pushing forces by germ cell proliferation . We have shown that lin-17/Fzd functions in a Wnt-independent manner to control SGP polarity , since the missing DTC phenotype of lin-17 ; cwn-2 and lin-17 mom-5 was completely rescued by ΔCRD-LIN-17 . In C. elegans , we found that vang-1/Vang does not appear to function with LIN-17/Fz , since most vang-1 single mutants and cwn-1 cwn-2 vang-1 triple mutants have two gonadal arms ( 215/216 and 58/58 , respectively ) . aa-derived DTCs consistently migrate anteriorly in wild-type animals and likely in other genetic backgrounds , giving the absence of the Dpd phenotype in previous reports . The loss of SGP polarity phenotype in the lin-17 ; cwn-2 double mutant but not in the lin-17 ; cwn-1 cwn-2 triple mutants was suppressed by further mutating egl-20 . In contrast , we show that these Wnts have distinct functions for SGP polarity at least in the lin-17 mutant background ( Figure 7 ) . The distinct responses of Z1 and Z4 to CWN-2 appear to be a key for their opposite polarity orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis . After reaching the distal ends , further distal migration is likely guided by germ cell proliferation and the degradation of the basement membrane at the distal sides . However , the self-migration of ectopic DTCs to the distal ends suggests that such migratory ability of DTCs may help their further distal migration . The function of CWN-1 for SGP polarity appears to be the same as for seam cell polarity , inducing HL polarity in both cases . In contrast to the role of EGL-20 in seam cells , where it induces HL polarity , it inhibits cell polarization in SGPs . egl-20 mutants show a reversal of phase III migration and this phenotype is suppressed by the cwn-1 mutation . Since it was suggested that CWN-1 is a permissive signal for seam cell polarity , it may also permissively regulate SGP polarity . The recovered polarity in lin-17 ; egl-20 cwn-2 depends on cwn-1 , as lin-17 ; cwn-1 ; egl-20 cwn-2 mutants showed
[METHODS] ",,901,93,None,"During development , cells in the gonad are arranged in a mirror-like shape . This is because they are made of two different types of cells , each of which has a different shape and size .

POP1 is a protein that helps germ cells to grow and divide , and it is also found on other parts of the body , such as the skin , the lungs and the intestines . In the nematode worm C . elegans , a group of cells called distal tip cells ( or DTCs ) are formed in the middle of the worm’s body .

[ABSTRACT] On the other hand , by demonstrating that hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to a few groups with characteristic tradeoffs , our findings may yet empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance . This question is difficult because the drug-resistant mutants observed in the clinic , and even those evolved in controlled laboratory settings , are often biased towards those that provide large fitness benefits . Here , we perform evolution experiments utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness advantage in fluconazole , a common antifungal drug . More generally speaking , by grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms , our work guides efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation . We then quantify fitness tradeoffs for each of 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments , finding these mutants group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs . Major questions remain about the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable , specifically , whether the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs . These findings , on one hand , demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments . Thus , the mutations ( and mechanisms ) that provide drug resistance may be more diverse than current data suggests . Tradeoffs are common in evolution and occur when , for example , resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another . Their unique tradeoffs may imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms . For example , we find some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination , while others do . There is growing interest in designing multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance . And some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others . Some of the groupings we find are surprising .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We confirmed that each group captures mutants with distinct properties using multiple approaches , including whole genome sequencing , growth curve experiments , tracing the evolutionary origins of the mutants in each cluster , and by using two additional independent clustering methods : hierarchical clustering and PCA ( Figures 5-8 ) . All of the aforementioned observations combined suggest that there are more unique types of FLU-resistant mutations than those represented by these 6 clusters , and that the molecular mechanisms that can contribute to fitness in FLU are more diverse than we know . On the other hand , the observation that some mutants have very similar tradeoffs such that they cluster together is promising in that it suggests predicting the impact of some mutations by understanding the impacts of others is somewhat feasible . Our results encourage more complex strategies to thwart drug resistance , such as those that focus on advance screening to determine the resistance mechanisms that are present , or on cycling a larger number of drugs to exploit a larger number of tradeoffs . This question is relevant to evolutionary medicine ( because more mechanisms of resistance make it harder to design strategies to avoid resistance ) , evolutionary theory ( because more mechanisms of adaptation make it harder to predict how evolution will proceed ) , and genotype-phenotype mapping ( because more mechanisms makes for a more complex map ) . We distinguish mutants that likely act via different mechanisms by identifying those with different fitness tradeoffs across 12 environments , leveraging the mutants ' barcodes to track their relative fitness following previous work . For example , we were able to show that the growth phenotypes of mutants from clusters 4 and 5 are different because we knew to look for these differences in multidrug environments ( Figure 7D ) . Additionally , previous work has shown that some mutants that group together in our study ( e. g. GPB2 and IRA2 ) have different fitness profiles in conditions that we did not include here . The approach presented in this study provides a way forward by identifying mutations that cluster together such that the effects of some mutants can be predicted from others . Finally , by requiring that all included mutants have sufficient sequencing coverage in all 12 environments , our study is underpowered to detect adaptive lineages that have low fitness in any of the 12 environments . Additional types of FLU-resistant mutants with unique fitness profiles may emerge from other genetic backgrounds or arise after more mutations are allowed to accumulate . And our results suggest radicicol environments may be most helpful in teasing out any phenotypic differences that set apart some PDR mutations from others ( Figure 6 ) . Perhaps we are unable to detect these mutants because their barcodes are at too low a frequency in RAD environments , thus they are excluded from our collection of 774 . These findings are important because they challenge strategies in evolutionary medicine that rely on consistent tradeoffs or intuitive trends when designing sequential drug treatments . This task has proven daunting in light of work demonstrating that mutations often have many phenotypic impacts and that these impacts change with contexts including the environment . This might explain why strategies that exploit one or two common tradeoffs have some , albeit mixed , success in delaying or preventing the emergence of resistance . In sum , our observation of numerous different types of drug-resistant mutations suggests that designing resistance-detering therapies is challenging , but perhaps not impossible
[METHODS] ",,952,96,None,"The ability of cells to adapt to new environments , such as the environment in which they live , is a key feature of evolution .

[ABSTRACT] Recent results from an auditory delayed comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought : when the posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) was silenced , both short-term and contraction biases were reduced . By proposing a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating the behavior , we show that a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience - producing short-term sensory history biases - naturally leads to contraction bias . Our results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings , delay intervals , as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas . The central tendency bias , or contraction bias , is a phenomenon where the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased toward the average of past observations . It is assumed to be an optimal strategy by the brain and commonly thought of as an expression of the brain 's ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input . On the other hand , recency biases such as serial dependence are also commonly observed and are thought to reflect the content of working memory . The errors , occurring at the level of individual trials , are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory toward the sensory distribution 's mean . Finally , we validate our model by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Recently , Akrami et al. , 2018 found that contraction bias as well as short-term history-dependent effects occur in an auditory delayed comparison task in rats and humans : the comparison performance in a given trial depends on the stimuli shown in preceding trials ( up to three trials back ) , similar to previous findings in human 2AFC paradigms . The abstract mathematical model that we present ( Figure 4 ) can be compatible with a Bayesian framework in the limit of a very broad likelihood for the first stimulus and a very narrow one for the second stimulus , and where the prior for the first stimulus is replaced by the distribution of s^ , following the model in Figure 4B ( see section 'The probability to make errors is proportional to the cumulative distribution of the stimuli , giving rise to contraction bias ' for details ) . It must be noted , however , that short-term history effects ( due to firing rate adaptation ) do not necessarily need to be invoked in order to recover contraction bias : as long as errors are made following random samples from a distribution in the same range as that of the stimuli , contraction bias should be observed . As a result , our model suggests that contraction bias may not simply be given by a regression toward the mean of the stimuli during the interstimulus interval , but brought about by a richer dynamics occurring at the level of individual trials , more in line with the idea of random sampling . This is in agreement with Hachen et al. , 2021 , where the authors used different stimulus ranges across different sessions and noted that rats initiated each session without any residual influence of the previous session 's range/boundary on the current session , ruling out long-term learning of the input structure . Moreover , an ideal Bayesian observer model alone can not capture the temporal pattern of short-term attraction and long-term repulsion observed in some tasks , and the model has had to be supplemented with efficient encoding and Bayesian decoding of information in order to capture both effects . Such heterogeneity of the PFC neurons ' temporal firing profiles has prompted the successful construction of models that have not included the basic assumption of plus and minus neurons , but these have largely focused on the plausibility of the dynamics of neurons observed , with little connection to behavior . Such continuous read-out of the memory reveals a rich dynamics of errors at the level of individual trials , similar to the delayed comparison case , but to our knowledge this has not been studied in previous experimental studies . Electrophysiological recordings as well as optogenetic inactivation results in the same study suggest that while sensory history information is provided by the PPC , its integration with the WM content must happen somewhere downstream to the PPC . In our model , both effects emerge naturally as a result of neuronal adaptation , but their amplitudes crucially depend on the time parameters of the task , perhaps explaining the sometimes contradictory effects reported across different tasks . The PPC is modeled as integrating inputs slower relative to the WM network and is also endowed with firing rate adaptation , the dynamics of which yield short-term history biases and , consequently , contraction bias . In further support of this , in a recent tactile categorization study , where rats were trained to categorize tactile stimuli according to a boundary set by the experimenter , the authors have shown that rats set their decision boundary according to the statistical structure of the stimulus set to which they
[METHODS] ",,925,95,None,"The brain is able to process information in a way that can be used to make decisions . For example , the brain processes information in the form of a list of items , which can then be compared to the number of items in the list . The brain also processes information from other parts of the body , such as the ear , nose , and mouth . This process is called the central tendency bias , or contraction bias . In humans , this is a phenomenon that occurs when a person is unable to remember the amount of information they have gathered over time . However , it is not clear how this bias is caused . To address this question , Wang et al . used a technique called a mathematical model to study the brain’s ability to learn the structure of sensory information . Using this model , they found that the brain has a strong tendency to make errors in the information it receives . These errors are based on a large number of different stimuli , but they are not due to a gradual shift in the content of the information , a process known as contraction bias that is characterized by a low probability of making errors . When the brain was silenced , contraction bias was reduced , suggesting that the neural circuits involved in learning the information are more likely to be involved in the process ."

[ABSTRACT] Mechanistically , nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) expression , suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells , and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration , turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) including those unleashed by ICIs . Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system , we investigated the therapeutic efficacy , action mechanism , and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles ( nanoPDLIM2 ) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs . We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 ( PDLIM2 ) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance , suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement . NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity , high tumor specificity , antitumor activity , and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs , with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination . These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers . In this study , human clinical samples and data were used to investigate PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer . Immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy , fail in most cancer patients . Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Using an authentic mouse model of lung cancer , we show , for the first time , that PDLIM2 nanotherapy shows efficacy and high safety , and more importantly , induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals when it is combined with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs . Most human lung tumors as well as lung tumors in our animal model have low numbers of TILs and decreased expression of PD-L1 and MHC-I on the cell surface , all of which are important mechanisms contributing to the resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy . More importantly , these preclinical data establish a novel combination treatment of nanoPDLIM2 , anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs that induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals and is also with high safety profile . Besides its side effects , epigenetic therapy should have much more limited application , even though it shows better efficacy as a monotherapy or combined with chemotherapeutic drugs or anti-PD-1 in comparison to PDLIM2 nanotherapy ( Figure 6-figure supplement 3 ) . Currently , various combinations of ICIs with other therapies , in particular its combination with chemotherapeutic drugs are being extensively tested in both preclinical and clinical trial studies to expand the benefit of this innovative therapy . Moreover , PDLIM2 nanotherapy prevents the induction of MDR1 and the expression of tumor-related genes and in particular cell survival genes , further sensitizing tumor cells to the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs and immune cells including those recruited by chemotherapy and unleashed by PD-1 blockade . In summary , the presented data identify genetic deletions as a major mechanism other than epigenetic alterations for PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer , and PDLIM2 as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor particularly important for suppressing lung cancer and therapy resistance . Because of these important functions of PDLIM2 nanotherapy , PDLIM2 nanotherapy improved the efficacy of chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade therapy , and in combination with chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade therapy , resulted in complete cancer remission in most of the animals and dramatic tumor reduction in the remaining mice . While nanoPDLIM2-based combination therapies could be applicable to all lung tumors with PDLIM2 repression regardless of the mechanisms involved , epigenetic therapy may be used to treat about 26 % of lung tumors with PDLIM2 epigenetic repression only . Although a promising synergy and better efficacy has been observed in both preclinical animal models and human clinical trial studies , significant further improvement is direly needed . Also , tumor cells usually express high levels of survival genes against the tumoricidal effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and of CTLs , including those activated by chemotherapy and unleashed by ICIs . This is in sharp contrast to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved epigenetic drugs , which can restore PDLIM2 expression in cancer cells with PDLIM2 epigenetic repression . Through inducing immunogenic cell death ( ICD ) of cancer cells , chemotherapy can increase TILs and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells , and thereby synergize with anti-PD-1 . We believe that these knowledges are applicable to other cancers , because PDLIM2 repression has also been linked to numerous human cancers other than lung cancer . About 58 % of lung tumors harboring PDLIM2 LOH are not suitable to epigenetic therapies , although most of them are also with epigenetic alterations of the pdlim2 gene . Further , the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of epigenetic agents with both anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs has not been examined yet . However , chemotherapy can not induce MHC-I expression , which limits further improvement of its synergy with immune therapy for complete cancer remission . On the

However , it is also a serious health problem , as it can lead to death if not treated properly . In some cases , the immune system is able to block the growth of cancer cells , which can lead the cancer to grow . The immune system also has a role in preventing cancer cells from growing , but it is not clear how this is achieved . A protein called PDLIM2 , or PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 , is repressed in lung cancer .

These plasmids were then injected into the lung cells of the mice , causing them to grow more quickly . When the mice were injected with a drug called PD-1 , they were unable to grow any more , leading to a reduction in the number of tumors in their lung cells and a decrease in their ability to survive . As a result , these mice were more sensitive to the drugs and were less likely to develop cancer , suggesting that the combination of these drugs could be a promising treatment for lung disease .

[ABSTRACT] The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis , particularly its neuronal function , which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors . However , the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system , which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior , are still not fully understood . This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food , thereby enhancing survival in natural environments . Moreover , animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation , which inhibits the UPRER -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis . Here , we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E. coli ) , a low-sugar food , triggers cellular UPRER and immune response . To survive in challenging environments , animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly . This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In contrast , our study reveals a new mechanism where the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) positively regulates Innate Immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) under HK-E. coli food conditions , establishing a novel physiological food evaluation system that activates the cellular stress response program . The disruption of cellular homeostasis by ingested of low-quality or toxic food can activate stress response mechanisms that both increase the cellular ability to withstand and adapt to this disruption of homeostasis and promote behavioral strategies to avoid these conditions and lessen their impact on the organism . This study identified a physiological food evaluation mechanism by which animals recognize food quality through UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) regulated cellular stress response program in neurons that dictates food avoidance and selection behaviors ( Figure 6 ) . Unlike the sensory neuron evaluation system , which permits rapid feeding decisions through smell and taste , the cellular stress response as physiological food evaluation system describe here requires a slow and multi-step signal transduction process after the ingestion of food . In our previous study , we discovered that the TORC1-ELT-2 pathway , acting as master regulators in intestine , evaluates vitamin B2 deficiency in low-quality food ( HK-E. coli ) and regulates gut digestive activity to impact animal 's food behavior . To further identified the mechanism by which animals evaluate low-quality food ( HK-E. coli ) , we performed metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses to identify specific nutrition deficiencies in low-quality food and the cellular response pathways that are involved in food evaluation pathway . This finding suggests that activating innate immunity ( PMK-1 MAPK ) may serve as a mechanism to slow down translation progress , thereby alleviating the pressure on the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) and preventing excessive UPRER activation . However , our results show that animals maintain similar VC levels when fed ideal food ( live E. coli ) compared to low-quality food ( HK-E. coli ; Figure 4B ) , suggesting that animals do not stimulate VC biosynthesis under favorable food conditions . In contrast , when animals are fed low-quality food ( HK-OP50 ) , we found that supplementing D-GlcA in HK-E. coli or E. coli-yfbR mutation can improve VC levels and inhibit UPRER-immunity ( Figure 4C ) . Most importantly , it reveals that animals are capable of altering their nutrient ( Vitamin C ) levels through in vivo synthesis or food intake to adapt to a poor food environment when better food choices are not available . Collectively , this study uncovers the unexpected function of UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) as a physiological food evaluation system for evaluating and sensing food quality in animals . One of the cellular stress response pathways , the Unfolded Protein Response ( UPRER ) , is activated by various stresses , including infection and nutrition deficiency , which disrupt the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . To investigate this further , we measured the translation level of animals fed with HK-E. coli and found that total translation ability is significantly reduced in these animals ( Figure 5-figure supplement 1D ) . The IRE1-XBP1 axis has been identified as a critical protective branch of the Unfolded Protein Response ( UPR ) induced secondary to an innate immune response in the presence of P. aeruginosa . Therefore , this slow physiological food evaluation system is an evolutionary adaptation mechanism for detecting nutrition deficiencies in food that was not detected by quick sensory nervous system . Fortunately , our investigation led to the discovery of the E. coli mutant yfbR , which inhibits UPRER and immunity by increasing carbohydrates that aid in resisting these stress pathways . Additionally , our study reveals that neuronal UPRER and PMK-1 are essential for evaluating low-quality food , suggesting that the nervous system plays a critical role in assessing food quality . Our own previous research has also demonstrated that

To find out more about how animals respond to food quality , Wang et al . used a technique called low-sugar E . coli . The experiments showed that the intestines of animals are sensitive to the chemicals in the food they are eating . In addition , a protein called the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) , which is involved in evaluating the quality of the food , was found to be a key regulator of the stress response in the brain . Wang also found that a neuron called the PMK-1-p38 MAPK , also involved in food evaluation , is also important for animals to avoid high-quality foods . These findings suggest that the URPER , an important signaling pathway , may be involved in the process of evaluating food quality in animals ."

[ABSTRACT] Integrating molecular dynamics simulation with functional study , we identified the uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) -sugar-binding site on P2Y14 , and revealed that a UDP-glucose might activate the receptor by bridging the transmembrane ( TM ) helices 2 and 7 . We identified the KDKE chain as a conserved functional motif of sugar binding for both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ) , and then designed three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12 . Here , we employed P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ) , a drug target for inflammation and immune responses , to uncover the sugar nucleotide activation of GPCRs . These results not only expand our understanding for activation of purinergic receptors but also provide insights for the carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs . However , it remains largely unknown how carbohydrates directly modulate important drug targets , such as G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . As a major class of biomolecules , carbohydrates play indispensable roles in various biological processes . Between TM2 and TM7 of P2Y14 , a conserved salt bridging chain ( K2 . 36 [ KDKE ] ) was identified to distinguish different UDP-sugars , including UDP-glucose , UDP-galactose , UDP-glucuronic acid , and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine . 60-D2 . 64-K7 . 35-E7 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Consistent with our observations , a previous structure-activity relationship study revealed that selective mono-fluorination of the 6 ' hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety results to fourfold less potency on P2Y14 . The KDKE motif not only participates in receptor activation by bridging TM2 and TM7 ( Figure 2 ) , but also recognize different sugar moieties , including glucose , galactose , glucuronic acid , and N-acetylglucosamine groups ( Figure 3 , Figure 4 ) . Exerting excessive P2Y14-mediated inflammatory reactions , high concentration of UDP-sugars was observed in extracellular tissue surrounding airway epithelial cells and lung secretions of cystic fibrosis patients . found that kidney collecting duct intercalated cells present high levels of P2Y14 , which is activated by UDP-Glc to promote neutrophil infiltration and renal inflammation . In addition , in the studies involving the other UDP-sugars , we also found that the interactions between sugar-moieties of agonists with TM7 is determinant for UDP-sugars ' potencies ( Figure 3 ) . Our molecular models of different sugar nucleotides provide great details for carbohydrate activation and recognition of these receptors , which would inspire further carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs . In typical glycosylation transfers as TarP and SseK3 , two aspartic acids and one positively charged residue ( arginine or lysine ) participate in recognition of 3 ' or 4 ' hydroxyl groups of GlcNAc or GalNAc moiety . In this work , we built the molecular model of UDP-Glc-bound P2Y14 to answer the long-standing question of sugar nucleotide regulation of the purinergic receptor . As another member of P2Y12-like subfamily , P2Y13 also has the conserved KDKE site ( Figure 4-figure supplement 3 ) , suggesting it might be regulated by carbohydrates . Except for P2Y14 , it has not been reported that the other members of P2Y12-like subfamily can be directly activated by carbohydrates . 36 at the corresponding positions of the KDKE sugar-binding motif , indicating varied carbohydrate sensitivities of this receptor in different species ( Figure 4-figure supplement 4 ) . Binding to an extracellular pocket involving TMs 2 and 7 ( Figure 1 ) , the UDP-Glc might serve as intramolecular 'glue ' attaching to TM6 and TM7 to activate P2Y14 ( Figure 2 ) . Compared with the AZD1283-bound ( antagonist-bound ) P2Y12 structure , the extracellular part of TM6 in the 2MeSADP-bound ( agonist-bound ) P2Y12 structure shifts over 10 Å and TM7 over 5 Å toward the center of TM helix bundle . In conclusion , we revealed a conserved carbohydrate-binding motif in both P2Y12 and P2Y14 , extending our understanding of how carbohydrates regulate GPCRs . The close parallel of P2Y12 and P2Y14 in the agonist-induced conformational changes indicates a common ligand-induced activation mechanism shared by purinergic receptors . UDP-Glc is also released from liver cells in obese states , possibly via hepatocellular apoptosis , leading to liver inflammation and insulin resistance . Further investigations focused on carbohydrate regulation of GPCRs will continue to add both new concepts and physiological understanding to the field . Similar to the KDKE motif of the receptors , the UDP-sugar-binding sites consisting of charged residues have been discovered for sugar transferases . Integrated computational modeling with mutagenesis study , we identified a conserved carbohydrate-binding motif ( KDKE ) for both P2Y14 and P2Y12 ( Figure 4 ) . Our MD simulations showed that KDKE motif attracted the 6 ' hydroxyl group of glucose and interacted with the 4 ' hydroxyl group of galactose ( Figure 3C and F ) . The different arrangements of UDP-sugar-binding sites between P2Y14 and these sugar transferases might be determinant for their sugar selectivity . Mediated by UDP-sugars , P2Y14 plays an important role in immune responses and inflammation , and possibly insulin resistance . The species repertoires of these receptors consist of many amniotes but a few anamniotes ( Supplementary file 3a ) . The agonist-induced remarkable conformational changes of
[METHODS] ",,895,93,None,"The human body uses a protein called G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) to detect and respond to inflammatory and immune responses . These receptors are made up of a group of molecules called sugars , which are able to bind to other molecules .

In particular , the role of sugars in regulating GPCR activity is not well understood . To investigate this question , Wei et al . used a computer simulation to study the activity of two sugars that are involved in the regulation of the GPCR . The simulation revealed that the sugars on P2Y14 , a drug target for inflammation and immune response , are bound to a sugar nucleotide . This nucleic acid binds to the sugar , but it was not known how it interacts with other sugars to activate the receptors . Wei and Wei have now used this information to develop a new drug that can activate the GPR receptors in mice . Using a molecular simulation , we found that sugars can interact with different sugars and that they can also interact with the receptor . Our results suggest that the binding of sugar to sugars is a key part of the cell’s response to inflammation ."

[ABSTRACT] The knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD+ level , which leads to the low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei . Here , we show that ferritin produced by glia , cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for the energy production , which is essential to the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs . In this study , we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable to maintain the self-renewal of NBs , unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development . Drosophila neural stem cells ( Neuroblasts , NBs ) are encased by glial niche cells closely , but it still remains unclear whether glial niche cells can regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs . In addition , the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs , establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis . Stem cell niche is critical for regulating the behavior of stem cells . More importantly , ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In this study , we demonstrate that the glial niche maintains the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs through supplying the necessary microelement iron into NBs for enough energy production , which implies that mammalian glia likewise provide critical microelement for maintaining NSC function . Our study shows that the block of ferritin or iron can inhibit tumors effectively , which offers an explanation that ferritin targets on the tumor is to transport iron for maintaining the cell proliferation , highlighting a potential target for tumor suppression . In this way , BBB glia separates the labile systemic iron from local iron inside the brain to guarantee the normal brain development , as the neural cells , including NBs , require a stable iron level for continuous energy generation during neurogenesis . Our results show that ferritin generated outside the brain was not detected in the CNS and vice versa ( data not shown ) , suggesting ferritin can hardly cross the BBB glia , possibly because ferritin is too large to permeate . Based on our findings , it is feasible to regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NSCs indirectly through niche cells , which would help to reduce the risk of directly manipulating NSCs to treat neural diseases . The bicellular iron homeostasis mechanism makes glial cells the main pool for ferritin production , relieving NBs from the need to produce ferritin and transferring the potential risk of iron overload-induced oxidative stress to glial cells . In addition , iron distribution in the Drosophila brain is not observed due to low iron concentration and technical limitations in iron detection , which results in a lack of direct evidence for iron trafficking via ferritin . Our data imply that energy deficiency in NBs caused by iron shortage leads to NB loss and low proliferation possibly through simultaneous disruption of TCA and OxPhos . In consideration of the role of ferritin in normal tissue , such as antioxidant defense function for neurons , the entire block of ferritin for suppressing tumor probably brings neurological disorders . Iron is an essential component for Fe-S clusters which participate in TCA and OxPhos , providing energy required for self-renewal and proliferation of NBs . Iron homeostasis can be regulated systemically by the liver-derived hormone hepcidin and the iron exporter ferroportin , and it is also regulated cellularly by the IRP/IRE system . Blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) glia secretes dILP2 and dILP6 that bind on the InR of NBs , which switches on Insulin signaling to reactivate NBs . Astrocytes regulate NSC proliferation via secreting growth factors , but it is unclear whether ferritin from astrocytes regulates NSC proliferation and other NSC behaviors , such as self-renewal and differentiation . Consistently , iron-loaded ferritin nanoparticles can be used to improve the self-renewal ability and differentiation potential of human NSCs in vitro . Oligodendrocytes have been reported to secret ferritin to protect neurons , however , it remains unknown whether the ferritin secretion is employed by oligodendrocytes to regulate NSCs . In mice , ferritin heavy chain is secreted by oligodendrocytes via extracellular vesicles , which possibly endows ferritin with the function of iron transport . In a proliferative state , NBs receive iron from glial cells via ferritin to fulfill the energy requirements for proliferation and self-renewal . Here , we propose a bicellular iron homeostasis between NB and glial niche cell , which is distinct from classic cellular and systemic iron homeostasis . Furthermore , glial cells can subsequently clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets , ensuring normal NB function during neural development . In addition , Pvr ( PDGFR ortholog ) signaling in cortex glia sustains NB survival and proliferation in a PI3K-DE-cadherin-dependent manner . Furthermore , iron depletion was reported to suppress human cancer cells growth at G1/S by inducing cyclin D1 proteolysis . These studies suggest that iron , as a necessary microelement for energy production , is essential to NSC maintenance and proliferation . When normal NBs

The experiments showed that glials are essential to maintain the self-renewal and proliferation of neural stem cell cells in the Drosophila brain . This is because the NB cells are encased by a niche called the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) and are surrounded by the aconitase gene . Interestingly , a small protein called adenitin is also present in the BBB cells and can be found in the NS . Wang  and Wang also found that a molecule called glucose binds to a receptor called Zip13 , and that this protein helps to regulate the levels of iron in the cells in response to iron overload . Furthermore , they found that the level of iron produced by glian cells is affected by the state of the BAB cells "

[ABSTRACT] Cancer is considered a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality , yet several countries have reported that deaths with a primary code of cancer remained within historic levels during the COVID-19 pandemic . To understand these differences , we simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates , life expectancy , population size , and mean age of individuals living with each condition . We find that the observed mortality differences are primarily explained by differences in life expectancy , with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19 . We compared pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause ( MC ) death data for six types of cancer , diabetes , and Alzheimer 's . Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers ( breast , colorectal , and hematological , 2-7 % ) than cancers with a poor survival rate ( lung and pancreatic , 0-1 % ) . Nationally in 2020 , MC cancer mortality rose by only 3 % over a pre-pandemic baseline , corresponding to ~13 , 600 excess deaths . Here , we further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US . Any pandemic-related changes in coding practices should be eliminated by study of MC data . In comparison , there was substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes ( 37 % ) and Alzheimer 's ( 19 % ) .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In contrast to earlier studies , we propose that lack of excess cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic reflects the competing mortality risk from cancer ( especially for deadly types like pancreatic and lung cancers ) itself rather than protection conferred from immunosuppression . We note the more pronounced elevation in mortality from hematological cancers during the pandemic , compared to other cancers and to expectations from a demographic model , which aligns with a particular group of cancer patients singled out in several cohort studies . Future research on the relationship between COVID-19 and cancer should concentrate on additional outcomes , such as excess hospitalizations , Long COVID , changes in screening practices during COVID-19 , and longer-term patterns in cancer mortality . Our detailed excess mortality study considered six cancer types and found that there is at most a modest elevation in cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US . Our results demonstrate the importance of considering MC-of-death records to accurately reflect changes in coding practices associated with the emergence of a new pathogen .",,452,64,Low token utilization (452/1024),"Cancer is the most common cancer in the world , but it is not the only cancer that causes death .

[ABSTRACT] Consistent with this , budding yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong synthetic interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in their chromosomes . While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established , there is still an incomplete understanding of the cellular processes responsible for their removal from eukaryotic genomes . Importantly , we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme in vitro . Here , we show that a core regulator of chromosome architecture -the Smc5/6 complex- plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription . Collectively , our results reveal a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres . The R-loop is a common transcriptional by-product that consists of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] As such , the exacerbation of the DNA damage sensitivity of RNase H mutants by temperature-sensitive alleles of the Smc5/6 complex may be the consequence of their effects on RNA-DNA hybrid removal ( i. e. , thus reflecting a 'within pathway ' contribution relative to RNase H1/H2 ) and their roles in additional biochemical pathways distinct from RNA-DNA hybrid degradation but still relevant to R-loop detoxification . The implication for the Smc5/6 complex is that it is probably not required to stimulate RNase H2 activity in all contexts in vivo but is likely more important in challenging environments where R-loops are highly abundant or otherwise difficult to degrade effectively by RNase H2 alone . Hints of a potential mechanism of action come from the observation that one of the enzymes responsible for R-loop degradation , RNase H1 , shows little enzymatic activity under basal conditions and requires stimulation by ancillary factors , such as RPA , to achieve maximal R-loop degradation . Maintaining a finely balanced cycle of R-loop formation and removal in chromosomes is crucial for the overall fitness of cells because altered RNA-DNA hybrid homeostasis can result in DNA damage and genomic instability , ultimately contributing to the development of several pathological conditions . Consistent with this suggestion , the Smc5/6 complex has been shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation to accumulate at sites that are common R-loop enrichment zones on chromosomes , including the rDNA locus , telomeres , and highly transcribed/difficult-to-replicate chromosomal loci . While previous genetic experiments have supported a role for the Smc5/6 complex in the natural regulation of TERRA levels at telomeres , our study reports the first demonstration that Smc5/6 complex activity is essential for the removal of unscheduled R-loops from the genome . This discovery is significant because non-physiological R-loops represent the most toxic and damaging source of RNA-DNA hybrids for genome stability and failure to remove these structures exacts a heavy toll on cell fitness . In this context , losing both RNase H and Smc5/6 complex activities will have consequences well beyond those observed in individual mutants because it will increase R-loop formation in a context where cells have lost the ability to cope with stress at replication forks . We showed the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to RNA-DNA hybrid structures formed during active gene transcription and telomere length regulation , and subsequently promotes the removal of these toxic structures via the stimulation of RNase H2 enzymatic activity . While it is not evident why the Smc5/6 complex would be involved in such a diverse and loosely connected group of cellular functions , it is nevertheless clear that failure to execute these functions generates toxic recombination intermediates in vivo . An RNase H2 stimulatory role for the Smc5/6 complex is compelling because it provides a cellular capacity/buffer to address substantial fluctuations in the total load of RNA-DNA hybrids produced under physiological and non-physiological conditions . The two RNase H enzymes differ , however , in that RNase H1 shows very little RNA degradation activity in the absence of RPA , whereas RNase H2 is moderately active as an R-loop degrading enzyme at basal state ( Figure 6 and Figure 6-figure supplement 1 ) . We showed that inactivation of Smc5/6 components leads to an increase in R-loop formation at several of these loci in the absence of RNase H enzyme activity , a result that aligns nicely with Smc5/6 complex localization in live cells . Separate from this possibility , the Smc5/6 complex plays a vital role in promoting RPA binding and maintenance at ssDNA during homologous recombination , a function that could indirectly stimulate RNase H1 activity and R-loop repair . This is a question for a future study , but it has not escaped our attention that RNase H1 is strongly stimulated by a ssDNA binding protein , RPA , a biochemical property also encoded in the Smc5/6 complex . This pattern of synthetic enhancements when inactivating effectors of RNA-DNA hybrid metabolism is consistent with multiple mechanisms acting independently to promote the removal
[METHODS] ",,874,92,None,"Cells are made up of many different types of DNA , including RNA , proteins , and chromosomes . The DNA is then transcribed into the form of a protein called RNA-DNA , which can then be used to make new proteins . This process is called transcription . However , it is not clear how this process is carried out . In yeast , a gene called R-loops is a common transcriptional by-product that is formed when a single strand of DNA is inserted into a strand that is displaced by a double-stranded RNA ( a DNA strand ) . R-Loops are a complex of RNA molecules that are arranged in a way that allows the DNA to be copied into the correct sequence . One of the most common forms of R loop is the R-leaf . A protein called RNase H2 binds to the R -loaf and removes it from the strands of DNA that are attached to the rDNA . It is thought that this protein is responsible for the removal of R loops , but it is unclear how this is done . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called immunoprecipitation to show that the Smc5/6 complex is involved in removing R-lloops from the genome of yeast cells . Using this technique , the yeast cells were able to remove the R–loop from their genomes and , as a result , they were more likely to develop disease . Wang "

[ABSTRACT] Longitudinally , however , our results raise caution on attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour : neither neural filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change could predict individual 2-year behavioural change , under a combination of modelling strategies . We here show that individual listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories modelling electroencephalographic and behavioural data of N = 105 ageing individuals ( 39-82 y ) . To this end , the age-typical loss of sensory acuity might in part be compensated for by an individual 's preserved attentional neural filtering . First , despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity , listening-task performance proved stable over 2 y . Second , neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint ( T1 , T2 ) . Is such a compensatory brain-behaviour link longitudinally stable ? Can it predict individual change in listening behaviour ? Preserved communication abilities promote healthy ageing .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Under this interpretation , the stable link of neural filtering to listening behaviour at different levels of granularity is noteworthy : an individual 's ability to exert top-down selective attention to prioritise the neural encoding of behaviourally relevant information is far from stable but it fluctuates at different time scales . A complete understanding of inter-individual differences in listening behaviour in ageing adults will therefore depend on a number of different factors among which the attention-modulated tracking of relevant speech constitutes one , potentially necessary , but not sufficient neural correlate . Second , it also does not allow the separation of distinct patterns of change co-occurring at the same time : one continuous , constant change with age along with a separate process in which relative change is proportional to the level observed at prior timepoints . However , these studies have ( i ) investigated the temporal stability across sessions spaced only days or weeks apart , ( ii ) focused on younger normal-hearing populations , or ( iii ) quantified the neural encoding of speech or non-speech stimulation that involved less or no attentional control . However , when analysed in our longitudinal sample of ageing listeners , irrespective of the precise definition of neural filtering , we did not find evidence for a predictive role of neural filtering despite supporting brain-behaviour links observed within each timepoint . In contrast , we here explicitly focused on a definition of neural filtering that incorporated the neural tracking of attended and ignored speech to highlight the dependence of communication success on the attention-guided differential neural encoding of relevant vs. irrelevant input . In recent years , the enhanced representation of behaviourally relevant sounds via their prioritised neural tracking has been reported in numerous listening studies investigating different acoustic environments , participant populations , and stages of auditory processing . Focusing on structural change may be advantageous : not only can structural feature be quantified more directly and reliably , they also follow systematic age-dependent trajectories , thereby providing clearer causal pathways for ensuing behavioural change . This entails that at a longer time scale , here captured by two distinct measurement timepoints , ageing individuals will differ with respect to their overall level of neural filtering and associated listening behaviour . While most desirable from a translational perspective and a core quest in the cognitive neuroscience of ageing , predicting change in cognitive functioning , here listening behaviour , from baseline or longitudinal change in brain function or structure is a non-trivial endeavour . Leaving the latent-variable framework aside , it is worth emphasising that the neural tracking of attended speech alone proved to be substantially more stable over time , with a retest reliability in the rtt = 0 . As a corollary of this relationship , typically observed cross-sectionally , one might expect an individual 's neural filtering strength to be connected not only to present but also to future trajectories of listening behaviour . Instead , a better understanding of the influences shaping individual listening behaviour across the adult lifespan will critically rely on uncovering the relative contribution and age-dependent dynamics of sensory , neural , and cognitive factors . As a second central query of the current study , we went beyond the establishment of robust brain-behaviour relationships and directly probed the potency of neural filtering to predict behavioural change over time . At the same time , the state-like nature of neural tracking-based metrics limits their translational potential as predictors of longitudinal change in listening behaviour over middle to older adulthood . These differences render a direct comparison to our approach difficult , but there is reason to consider a model-derived , latent representation of neural filtering as employed here the more generalisable metric . Given how robustly the current data show the enhanced neural tracking of attended vs. ignored speech at the group level , the weak reliability of individual neural filtering strength may come as a surprise . Our data caution against explaining audiology-typical listening performance solely from changes
[METHODS] ",,868,92,None,"When a person listens to a speech , their brain processes the information that they hear . This information is then processed in a way that allows them to listen to the speech they are listening to . However , it is not clear how the brain processes this information . For example , some people have a tendency to focus more on the sounds they hear than the ones they are hearing . In other cases , the brain is able to process information that is not relevant to their speech . It is therefore important to understand how this process works , and how it can be used to improve our ability to listen . To do this , we need to know how our brain processes information that we hear , or how it is processed in our brain . We need to understand the brain’s ability to filter information , which is a process that is largely dependent on how we use our brain to process sound . The brain has a number of different ways of filtering information: it can filter information by focusing on specific sounds , such as words or phrases , rather than on the words they are heard . But how does this process work in the brain ? To answer this question , Wang et al . studied the brains of 105 ageing adults over the course of two years . Using a combination of computer simulations and electroencephalographic data , they analysed the brain activity of the 105 individuals . They found that the brain processing of information was stable , but that the neural processing of speech was also stable . These findings suggest that , in the future , an individual’s brain processing ability might be compensated for by a reduction in the amount of information that he or she receives . A further study is needed to determine whether this is the case ."

[ABSTRACT] In ancient Greece and Rome , illness was thought to arise from imbalance in bodily fluids or humours , yet our study suggests that uses of drugs were based on observed physiological effects that are often consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology . Here , we generate tasting-panel data for botanical drugs and apply phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models to test whether intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities as well as particular tastes and flavours can predict ancient Graeco-Roman drug use . We found chemosensation to be strongly predictive of therapeutic use : botanical drugs with high therapeutic versatility have simple yet intense tastes and flavours , and 21 of 22 chemosensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use . The perception of taste and flavour ( a combination of taste , smell , and chemesthesis ) , here also referred to as chemosensation , enables animals to find high-value foods and avoid toxins . In addition to the common notion of bitter tasting medicines , we also found starchy , musky , sweet , and soapy drugs associated with versatility . Humans have learned to use unpalatable and toxic substances as medicines , yet the importance of chemosensation in this process is poorly understood .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While we are aware that the limitation of this study is the impossibility to address all associations found and the dependence on published pharmacological data for the explanatory part , our approach demonstrates the power of phylogenetic methods applied to human behaviour and assessment of plant properties . The therapeutic versatility of drugs perceived as sweet ( 13 positive associations ) and starchy ( 12 positive associations ) ( Figure 3 ; Supplementary files 5 and 6 ) is influenced by the many staples and edible fruits that are also used for medicine ( e. g. protein-rich Fabaceae seeds were often perceived as having starchy tastes ) . 002 ) is explained by uses intended to purge and resolve bitter bile and seems to include what we call choleretics and cholekinetics today , such as the roots of the great yellow gentian ( Gentiana lutea ) or the herb of the common vervain ( Verbena officinalis ) . In part , this may be the outcome of an arms race between plant defence and herbivorous mammals ' bitter taste receptor sensitivities , resulting in the synthesis of metabolites capable of repelling herbivores and confounding the perception of potential nutrients by mimicking tastes of toxins . This is , for instance , the case with opium ( dried milk sap of Papaver somniferum ) indicated for 'cough ' and perceived as bitter ( Figure 3 ; Supplementary files 1 and 2 ) but at the same time containing alkaloids with central cough suppressant properties . For example , starchy flavours or sweet tastes can be sensed when bitter and astringent antifeedant compounds are present below a certain threshold while salts enhance overall flavour by suppressing the perception of bitter tastants . Cooling menthol and eucalyptol have been shown to act as counterirritants inhibiting respiratory irritation caused by smoke constituents explaining the positive association between drugs used to treat breathing difficulties with fresh and cooling flavours ( px = 0 . Bitter-tasting drugs to treat sciatica derive from several disparate lineages containing a range of different anti-inflammatory compound classes such as iridoids , sesquiterpene lactones , triterpene saponines , and cumarins ( Supplementary files 1 and 2 ) . 022 , respectively ; Figure 3 ; Supplementary files 5 and 6 ) are probably related to the avoidance of nociception known by personal experience to result from the contact between acidic or salty solutions and skin or mucous membrane lesions . Bitter taste receptors , for instance , are located also in human airways where their activation mediates bronchodilation and the movement of motile cilia which leads to improved respiration and evacuation of mucus . Low therapeutic versatility of sour tasting drugs ( 12 negative associations ) may best be understood by considering the uses that this taste was negatively associated with in our PGLMMs ( Figure 3 ) . Cumulative evidence suggests that together with transient receptor potential channels ( TRPs ) , extraoral taste receptors and ectopic olfactory receptors form a chemosensory network involved in homeostasis , disease response , and off-target drug effects . While chemosensory qualities of botanical drugs and their physiological effects help to explain the persistence of humoral medicine until the 19th century , our study highlights the potential of chemosensory pharmacology in the development of herbal medicines . We also detected nuances in significance , and complete absence of significance across the relationships between individual therapeutic uses and complexity/intensity magnitudes for which we lack , however , more specific explanations ( Figure 2-figure supplement 1 ) . Moreover , acidic solutions and tissue acidosis are associated with inflammation and nociception while acid reflux is a common cause of chronic cough probably triggered by an oesophageal-bronchial reflex . The 96 botanical drugs specifically mentioned also for food ( though there are more than 150 edible drugs in our dataset ; Supplementary file 1 ) show positive associations with starchy ( px

[ABSTRACT] Lastly , we find that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions . We define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum , colonization of hemorrhagic lesions , and the consumption of serum nutrients as 'bacterial vampirism ' , which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections . To simulate GI bleeding , we utilized an injection-based microfluidics device and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source . We report the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues . Herein , we report that clinical isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars , Escherichia coli , and Citrobacter koseri are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum . Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae are associated with gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death , from sepsis , for individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases . This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine , an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr . We find Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections . The bacterial behaviors and mechanisms underlying why these bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry remain poorly understood .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Although the host-derived metabolites NE and DHMA have been reported to be chemoattractants for E. coli sensed directly through Tsr , we were unable to corroborate these results in S. Typhimurium in chemotaxis experiments , nor binding assays with the purified recombinant LBD , despite the high-sequence conservation between the two orthologues ( Figure 4-figure supplement 1 , Figures 7L and M and 8A , https : //public . The specific nutrients responsible for the growth benefits derived from serum remain undefined ; however , one potential candidate is the presence of energy-rich glycoconjugates , which were previously implicated as nutrients for bacteria within the inflamed intestine based on the upregulation of galactose utilization operons and the prevalence of lectin-positive stained tissue . An unanticipated result from obtaining the first structures of SeTsr LBD ( PDB : 8FYV ) is that the well-resolved ligand-binding site contradicts key interactions as they were modeled in the earlier EcTsr LBD structure ( 3ATP ) , apparently owing to the difficulty of interpreting the weak electron density ( Figure 7F-I ) . In contrast , we saw that L-serine drove chemoattraction to a source as low as 500 nM , all strains tested were attracted to L-Ser , a binding KD to SeTsr LBD of 5 µM was established through ITC , and was captured in complex in the SeTsr LBD crystal structure with clearly defined electron density ( Figures 5 and 7 ) . From this database of Tsr sequences , we were able to visualize the distribution of Tsr orthologues across biology , which strikingly are enriched among Enterobacteriaceae , but are also present in several other families that include WHO priority pathogens ( Figure 8B , Supplementary file 2 ) . Therefore , while we acknowledge that serum attraction is not a routine pathogenesis strategy employed by Salmonella , the significant number of bacterial-induced GI bleeding cases and the association between GI bleeding and bacterial invasion into the bloodstream provide opportunities for bacterial vampirism to be involved in infection outcomes . Therefore , the differences in the models are not attributable to them being two different proteins , rather the EcTsr LBD structure is modeled incorrectly , and both structures should be modeled with the serine pose and ligand-binding site as they are in the SeTsr LBD structure ( Figure 7F ) . The SeTsr LBD structure was also helpful in accurately defining the signature motif of Tsr orthologues , which allowed us to mine genomic databases and report the first extensive characterization of which bacterial species possess this chemoreceptor ( Figure 8A and B ) . Enteric Peyer 's patches are primary invasion sites for non-typhoidal Salmonella , and these structures are situated close to vasculature that can be damaged through the pathogen 's destruction of microfold ( M ) cells , causing localized bleeding . In the context of Salmonella pathogenesis , it is interesting to note that diverse serovars , which vary in terms of host specificity and epidemiology , exhibit serum attraction and have the ability to utilize serum as a nutrient ( Figures 3 and 6 ) . Our inability to substantiate a structure-function relationship for NE/DHMA signaling indicates these neurotransmitters are not ligands of Tsr , or , at the very least , are not broadly relevant as chemoeffectors sensed through Tsr orthologues . Through comparative refinements , we show that changing the ligand position and binding site residues of the EcTsr LBD model to be as they are in the SeTsr LBD structure demonstrably improves the model ( Figure 7J ) . In a study using a dextran sodium sulfate ( DSS ) -colitis model to investigate L-serine utilization by Enterobacteriaceae , L-serine was identified as a critical nutrient providing metabolic and growth advantages in

The bacteria that cause these infections are known as Enterobacteriaceae . These bacteria are found in the bloodstream of the intestines , where they can cause a variety of diseases including gastrointestinal bleeding , bacteremia , and sepsis . However , it is not clear how these bacteria are able to escape from the blood stream , which can lead to serious health problems . One way that bacteria can escape from bloodstream is through a process called chemotaxis . This process involves a protein called L-serine , or chemoreceptor , that senses the amino acid in the serum of the infected bacteria and binds it to the protein . It is thought that this protein is a key component of the immune system that helps the bacteria to move into the blood , but it has not been known how it is used by the bacteria . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called microfluidics to measure the amount of serum that the bacteria were consuming . Using a microscope , they found that femtoliters of human serum were sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source . In addition , the bacteria also ate the protein in their bloodstream , making it more likely that they would be attracted to L-Serine in the future . Finally , using a chemoattractant , Li , Wu ed . found that the chemorrhagic enzyme Tsr , an amino acid that is abundant in serum , was also a factor in the bacteria’s ability to escape the blood"

[ABSTRACT] We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10 , 000 protein-coding genes , a third of which defines a genetic scaffold of deeply conserved genes that has been retained throughout evolution . These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies . By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity , we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility . However , the unique evolutionary dynamics of male germ cells coupled with their widespread leaky transcription pose significant obstacles to the identification of the core spermatogenic program . Such scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis . Through network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species , we describe the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level . Male germ cells share a common origin across animal species , therefore they likely retain a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Also , this information can potentially be harnessed in other clinically relevant contexts : the spermatocyte orthoBackbone can be further explored to pinpoint key pathways that may facilitate the reconstitution of meiotic entry in vitro , as well as to maximize the effectiveness of exome sequencing approaches in infertile men through the inclusion of the orthoBackbone genes in prioritization lists for disease-causing variants . The latter led to the exclusion of established animal models such as C. elegans ( hermaphrodites ) and zebrafish ( juvenile hermaphrodites ) since it is largely unknown to what extent their male germ cell transcriptome may deviate from the gonochoric program ( by retaining oogenesis-related characteristics , for example ) . The assumed autosomal dominant inheritance of HSPA2 and KPNA2 awaits further confirmation by additional data from independent cohorts and segregation analyses , but stands in line with other well-established male infertility genes such as DMRT1 , NR5A1 , and SYCP2 . By focusing on the deep evolutionary past of human spermatogenesis , we have identified 79 functional interactions that likely represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of male germ cells , and 179 novel functionally validated candidate genes . By functionally interfering with 920 deeply conserved genes associated with male germ cell identity , we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes required for a broad range of germ cell functions , as well as three new potential genetic causes of human infertility . Conversely , future iterations of our analytical pipeline can be specifically tailored for the identification of newly emerged genes that may have acquired key roles in reproductive processes , such as those involved in species-specific gamete recognition . It should be noted that our conclusions were based on a small fraction of the diversity of all metazoan species , as a result of data availability limitations and our focus on well-characterized gonochoric animal models of human spermatogenic impairment . In summary , we have identified a conserved male germ cell gene expression program , spanning more than 600 million years of evolution , that can provide clinical insight into the molecular basis of human infertility . We further pinpoint 79 functional interactions between 104 transcriptional regulators that , owing to their salient network properties across different species , likely define a core component of the ancient genetic program of spermatogenesis . Indeed , despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ and frequent birthplace of genetic novelty , deeply conserved genes are central components of the male germ cell transcriptome , with younger genes being preferentially expressed in late spermatogenesis . Central to this debate is the moderate success in translating animal data to the clinical setting , coupled with the fact that the vast majority of human genetic variants are not shared with other species . Taken together , our results emphasize the often-overlooked contribution of evolutionary history to human disease and illustrate how interdisciplinary research can significantly expand our knowledge of fundamental cellular processes . The translational application of our cross-species platform in human reproductive healthcare has so far uncovered three new genes associated with human male infertility ( RNF113B , HSPA2 , and KPNA2 ) . We propose that the transcriptional identity of metazoan male germ cells is built around a relatively small network of deeply conserved gene interactions with an overarching functional impact . Accordingly , all the code required for repurposing our analytical pipeline to other cell types and pathologies is available as an open-access resource at https : //github . We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10 , 000 protein-coding genes , the majority of which are deeply conserved . The existence of a shared genetic identity in metazoan spermatocytes can be regarded as a ramification of an ancestral multipotency program already present in germ line precursor cells .

This is due to the fact that many of the genes that are required for male germ cells have been lost over time , and this has led to a number of human diseases . One of the most common causes of infertile men is spermatogenesis , a process in which a female sex mate with another male . In this process , the male germ cell produces a protein called HSPA2 .

[ABSTRACT] With a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum , we show that the coordinated beating essentially only responds to load exerted on the cis flagellum ; and that such asymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two flagella . The model organism for studying flagellate motility , Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , employs synchronous , breaststroke-like flagellar beating to swim , and it modulates the beating amplitudes differentially to steer . In C. reinhardtii , the synchrony of beating is known to be supported by a mechanical connection between flagella ; however , how flagellar asymmetries persist in the synchrony remains elusive . This strategy hinges on both inherent flagellar asymmetries ( e. g. different response to chemical messengers ) and such asymmetries being effectively coordinated in the synchronous beating . For example , it has been speculated for decades that one flagellum leads the beating , as its dynamic properties ( i. e. frequency , waveform , etc . ) In this study , we combine experiments , computations , and modeling efforts to elucidate the roles played by each flagellum in synchronous beating . Our results highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in coordination and have implication for biflagellates ' tactic behaviors . Eukaryotes swim with coordinated flagellar ( ciliary ) beating and steer by fine-tuning the coordination . appear to be copied by the other one .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] Exploiting the observation that the coordination between flagella can not be broken by external flows up to the strongest ones tested ( εmax∼10 Hz , Figure 2B ) , we quantify the lower limit of the total basal coupling , λct+λtc , to be approximately 40 Hz ( deduced in Appendix 1 : Monte-Carlo simulations ) , which is an order magnitude larger than the hydrodynamic inter-flagellar coupling . In contrast to the speculation that calcium is involved in the dynamic modulation of ciliary dominance in synchronous beating , our results indicate that the leading role of cis ( i. e. , λct≫λtc ) is an inherent property , which does not require active influx of external calcium , and possibly reflects an intrinsic mechanical asymmetry of the cellular mesh that anchors the two flagella into the cell body . Moreover , this point is further highlighted by an unexpected finding : when trans-flows are applied , the trans flagellum always beats against the external flow ( PFlowt < 0 ) and the only stabilizing factor for flow entrainment is the cis flagellum working transiently along with the flow ( PFlowc > 0 ) during the recovery stroke ( Figure 1G lower panel ) . Assuming the sensing-related bio-activities is at the origin of trans ' strong noise , then because the unilateral coupling prevents the noise from disrupting the cell 's synchronous beating and effective swimming , it allows the cell to combine the benefit of having a stable cis as the driver and a noisy trans as a sensor . Calcium has long been speculated to facilitates such dynamic modulation because it is involved in switching the beating mode and in tuning flagellar beating amplitude , and calcium influx comprises the initial step of the cell 's photo- and mechanoresponses . Intriguingly , when connected by basal fibers and beating synchronously , they both adopt the kinematics of the cis- ( eyespot ) flagellum , which led to the assumption that the flagella may have differential roles in coordination . Using this model , we express f and ε , which we can measure experimentally ( Equation 3 ) , as a function of fc , t , ϵc , t , λct and λtc to illustrate how the flagellar dominance and selective loading affect the coordinated flagellar beating . In this work , we test this hypothesis by employing oscillatory flows applied from an angle with respect to the cells ' symmetry axis and thus exert biased loads on one flagellum . Previous studies suggested that both flagella of ptx1 are similar to the wildtype trans , and that the noise levels of this mutant 's synchronous beating are much greater than those of wt ( see also Appendix 1 : Noise in the beating of the ptx1 mutant ) . In all our experiments with wt cells , we robustly observe that cis-flows , the ones that selectively load the cis flagellum , are always more effective in entraining the flagellar beating than the trans-flows . Mapping ε ( θ ) as a function of the loads , we find empirically that the flow entrainment strength scales with the hydrodynamic load on the cis , ε∝F¯Flowc ( Figure 3D ) and that trans-loads appear to matter negligibly . Calcium depletion merely induces an overall drop in the forcing strength perceived by the cell ε ( θ ) ( 7 % −20 % ) , which is captured by reducing ϵc+ϵt for 15 % ( mean drop ) in the model ( Figure 5G ) . The two flagella of C. reinhardtii have long been known to have inherently different dynamic properties such as frequency , waveform , level of active noise , and responses to second messengers . These observations definitively prove that the two flagella have differential roles in

However , it is not clear how the synchronous beating is maintained . In the model organism , Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , a species of worm that uses the breaststroke-like beating to swim , the ciliary flagellum beats at the same frequency as the other flagella and steers by fine-tuning the rhythm of the beating . To investigate this , Wang et al . used a technique called a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagella on its own . These experiments show that the rhythmic beating is controlled by the presence of a single flagella in the cell , which is known as the “flagellar beating” . Interestingly , this rhythmic beat only responds to the force exerted on the cis flagellus , but not to the external force . Wang "

Here , we reported that intermittent fasting promoted interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) production by type 3 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC3s ) and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue . Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages . Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s . Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice . Deficiency of IL-22 receptor ( IL-22R ) attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting . Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue . Mechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Consistently , previous studies have shown that secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s changes between active and quiescent periods throughout the day which is regulated by the cycle patterns of food intake . IL-22 activates IL-22 receptor , which then regulates the expression of downstream inflammatory factors , tissue repair molecules , chemokines , antimicrobial peptides , and other molecules via Jak-1- and Tyk-2-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3 . In addition to directly promoting the beigeing of white adipose tissue through IL-22 , intestinal ILC3s may enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier , reducing serum LPS and peptidoglycan , thus reducing the inhibitory effect of LPS and peptidoglycan on the beigeing of white adipose tissue . Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s isolated from lean mice was sufficient to improve the metabolic dysfunctions in DIO mice , including increase of white adipose tissue beigeing and glucose tolerance . Second , a comprehensive set of in vivo and in vitro experiments shows that intermittent fasting promotes adipose tissue beigeing through the intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis . Together with previous report showing that IL-22 increases the lipolysis of adipocytes , our studies suggest that IL-22 can directly act on adipocytes to alter the adipose tissue homeostasis . Further examination should focus on dissecting the novel molecular mechanism by which intestinal DCs and macrophages interact with ILC3s and its consequence on the IL-22 production . First , intermittent fasting stimulates the secretion of IL-22 by intestinal ILC3s in either lean mice fed NCD , obese mice fed HFD , or mice with metabolic dysfunction induced by HFCD diet . Moreover , segmented filamentous bacteria may account for the effect of feeding on the secretion of IL-22 by intestinal ILC3s by periodically attaching to the epithelial surface . Similarly , Sasaki et al. , 2019 , have demonstrated that transplanting bone marrow cells from Rag2-/- mice ( lack of T cells , B cells ) into Il2rg-/- Rag2-/- mice ( lack of T cells , B cells , ILC cells ) could not increase the number of ILC3s in the adipose tissue of recipient mice . In support of this concept , our single-cell RNA-seq analysis shows a significant change in the intestinal immune cell network involving DCs , macrophages , and ILC3s . Consistently , our single-cell RNA-seq data also showed that VIPR2 is highly expressed in intestinal ILC3s and intermittent fasting activates VIPR2 signaling pathway . Importantly , the proportion and density of ILC3s in white adipose tissue of people with obesity increase relevant to healthy people , and positively correlate with BMI in obese patients . Thus , our results provide novel evidence supporting the concept that intestinal ILC3s modulate beigeing of adipose tissue via IL-22-IL-22R pathway . Since release of VIP is stimulated by food intake , these observations indicate that VIP-VIPR signaling may coordinate with food intake to drive the production of IL-22 . In lines with our observation , a series of recent studies have suggested that cytokines can act directly on adipocytes to regulate thermogenesis . Previous studies indicate a mechanism involving neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) , which is able to stimulate the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s . IL-22 promotes heat production , renders mice resistant to reduction of body temperature induced by cold exposure , and reduces obesity induced by HFD . In addition , feeding may decrease the levels of antimicrobial peptides secreted by epithelial cells , while increasing the expression of lipid-binding proteins . O'Sullivan et al. , 2016 , have reported that ILC3s are negligible in white adipose tissue of either lean or obese mice . These alterations may substantially influence the immune networks in intestine , leading to subsequent change in the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s . Our present study demonstrates that intestinal ILC3s are critical for the beigeing of white adipose tissue induced by intermittent fasting . Our studies suggest that IL-22 may promote the expression of downstream thermogenic genes in adipose tissue through IL-22R . Using the marker lineage-KLRG1-Il-7rα+Thy-1+ , ILC3s cells have been reported to account for approximately 20 % of lineage-KLRG1-Il-7rα+
[METHODS] ",,864,92,None,"In order to maintain healthy weight , we need to be able to maintain a healthy diet . This is achieved by eating a diet that is rich in fat , sugar , and other nutrients . However , it is not clear how intermittent fasting helps to maintain this balance . For example , if you are overweight or obese , you may need to switch to a low-fat diet , such as high-fat dairy or low-carbohydrate diets . If you are a diabetic , your blood sugar levels may be lower than normal when you are on a fasting diet compared to normal . In addition , the amount of fat in your body can be affected by the type of food you eat . It is important to know how intermittent Fasting affects your body’s metabolism . To do this , researchers have developed a new way to treat obesity . They used a technique called RNA sequencing to identify the cells that secrete interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) , which is a protein that helps to repair damaged tissue . The experiments showed that if the cells secreted IL22 , they would be more likely to be beiged . Moreover , these cells could also be a target for other molecules , including cytokines , that help to repair damage . These findings suggest that intermittent fasts can help to maintain the balance of fat and sugar levels in the body .

[ABSTRACT] To thoroughly investigate defensive ethograms , we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that paired footshock with a serial compound stimulus ( SCS ) consisting of distinct tone and white noise ( WN ) stimulus periods . To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses , we compared this paired SCS-footshock group with four control groups that were conditioned with either pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock , shock only , or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order , with paired or unpaired presentations . These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness , but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression . However , most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms focus only on freezing behavior , obscuring the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses . During extinction , the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group , and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting . Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity , proximity , and context of exposure , and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival . Comparatively , the unpaired and both reverse SCS groups expressed less tone-induced freezing and rarely showed jumping or darting during WN . On day 2 of conditioning , the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period . The unpaired , unpaired reverse , and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS , with minimal freezing and jumping . Interestingly , the paired reverse group did not jump to WN , and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction . Following the second day of conditioning , we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Non-associative elements such as cue salience , change in stimulus intensity , and shock-induced sensitization elicit stress-associated behaviors like tail rattling and activity bursts , as hypothesized before , but the addition of the WN-threat associative pairing contributes significantly to eliciting high-intensity defensive responses like escape jumping . Given that the PA-R group did not display consistent jumping behavior to WN or tone , this suggests that a robust jumping response to WN in the SCS paradigm is not due to the non-associative salience of the WN as others have suggested but is instead due to its association with imminent threat . Overall , darting behaviors during conditioning contribute to the higher activity score observed during WN in the PA group , and our data suggests that these contributions are the result of associative learning and threat imminence , rather than non-associative stimulus salience . Previous studies have factored jumping behaviors into normalized measures to gauge conditioned flight behavior , but given the increased activity indices in the PA , UN , and UN-R groups , we examined if the escape jumping we observed was associative or non-associative ( Figure 3 ) . Indeed , darting behavior has been shown to change based on multiple parameters , decreasing both with increased shock intensity and with prolonged extinction training , suggesting that darting is both an associative conditioned response to stimuli associated with threat and a response resulting from non-associative sensitization . Future studies can utilize this paradigm to investigate neuronal mechanisms that contribute to threat association and direct dynamic responses to threat , with important implications for developing new treatments for those who suffer from fear and anxiety disorders . Additionally , we found that the PA and PA-R groups showed significant increases in freezing from pre-SCS to tone , while in the UN and UN-R groups , freezing to tone was no greater than contextual freezing , suggesting that the paired groups placed associative value on the tone ( Figure 2J ) . This jumping behavior to WN is associative and can be extinguished , making it a suitable measure for future studies interested in how the nervous system controls experience-dependent high-intensity fear reactions . This is consistent with our results from the UN , UN-R , and SO groups , who displayed greater tail rattling to unpaired ( UN , UN-R groups ) or novel ( SO group ) SCS presentations within the conditioning context , with reductions in tail rattling over the course of extinction exposure . Taken together , this suggests that tail rattling is not a behavior exhibited during post-encounter or circa-strike levels of threat , but rather within stressful scenarios where danger is uncertain but anticipated . Future studies that are interested in measuring defensive responses to threat signals such as context , odor , or innately aversive sensory stimuli should consider measuring tail rattling as a marker of non-associative anticipatory fear . While behaviors like darting and tail ratting can occur due to non-associative stimulus-inherent properties , transitions between freezing and jumping are robustly present when associative factors signal threat imminence . In response to WN during extinction , the PA group transitioned from explosive circa-strike flight responses containing escape jumps to a combination of anticipatory post-encounter freezing and darting ( Figure 6A , Figure 7 ) . Freezing to tone and activity to WN were both significantly higher in the PA group compared to the UN group ( Figure 2E and K ) , highlighting the impact of SCS-shock contingency on the magnitude of defensive responses . Given that darting can be elicited in stressed
[METHODS] ",,943,96,None,"The nervous system is made up of neurons , called neurons that respond to a variety of stimuli , including sound , light , and noise . These neurons are known as ethograms , which are used to measure the activity of neurons in the brain . In particular , they are often used to predict the intensity of a threat , such as fear or anxiety . However , it is not clear how these etograms work . For example , if a person is experiencing a fearful situation , the ephemeral neurons in their brains can respond to the same stimulus . This is because the brains of mice are trained to respond to different stimuli in a similar way . To test this , researchers used a technique called Pavlovian fear conditioning . The experiments involved a group of mice , each with a footshock and a white noise stimulus , to learn how to react to the sound . After the training , mice were shown to respond by jumping and darting , while the other group jumped and jumped . When the mice were exposed to the white noise , their defenses changed dramatically . During the second day of the training period , when the mice had been exposed to white noise for a second time , some of the mice showed more aggressive behavior , like jumping and tail rattling , than the other groups . Conversely , during the third day of training the mice responded to the black noise despite the fact that they were not able to jump or dart . Further experiments showed that the mice’s defenses were more responsive to the blue noise compared to the two groups , suggesting that the brain’s response to the red noise is based on learning about the danger , rather than learning about"

[ABSTRACT] Finally , we illustrate that in our theory , the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles . Furthermore , we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity , implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development . To address this question , we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits , all with different activity patterns . We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly , finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence . Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure . Among these activity patterns , we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient , but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons . However , it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage . To navigate their environment , insects need to keep track of their orientation .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This would be particularly relevant for foraging insects such as bees or ants , whose ability to remember their position with respect to their nest has been the subject of many experimental and computational studies . Insects often rely on a reference system that is globally anchored to a certain point or phenomenon , whether it is their nests for ants and bees , the sunlight polarisation pattern for locusts , or the milky way for dung beetles . We argue that even if these insects live in a 3D environment , the third dimension ( up-down ) is different from the other two due to gravity and the existence of a hard boundary ( the ground ) . Finally , another interesting avenue for future work is to compare the encoding of direction in insects with that of mammals , which encode heading in a fundamentally different way that uses many more neurons . We also show that our proposed circuit can be developed by a simple Hebbian-based learning rule , and that the presence of the eight-column structure can be explained from the perspective of replication dynamics . Furthermore , we showed that such a circuit can be developed and maintained by a biological learning rule , and proposed a mathematical argument for the eight-column structure found in insect compass circuits . Heading integration circuits in insects have been extensively studied , with models ranging in complexity from simplified conceptual networks to sophisticated models constrained by biological data and featuring multiple neuron types . On the other hand , mammals such as rodents typically do not use global cues but rely on local landmarks that are context-dependent and only occur in specific locations . By showing that sinusoidal activity emerges from the theoretically most noise-resilient heading integration circuit , and verifying that the corresponding circuit matches experimental data , we close this explanatory gap . However , this can not be the only reason because as we show there is a whole family of circuits with different encoding patterns that enable easy vector addition . We could also investigate circuits that integrate position , not only heading , which would require the activity to have a 2D plane topology instead of a circle . Previous theoretical work has argued that a sinusoidal activity encoding is such a common motif in insect navigation because it facilitates elementwise vector addition . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that such arguments have been put forward in the context of a specific circuit with a specific function . Both results align with the idea that evolution should be biased towards structures that are easier to encode in the genome and learn . In this work we derived an optimal noise-minimising circuit for encoding heading and verified that this circuit matches experimental data from insects . This raises a critical question : why would the circuit and encoding be different if navigation follows similar principles across species ? The use of a circular topology to encode the head direction of the insect is valid only in 2D environments . In this section , we discuss the implications and limitations of these contributions , and outline potential future work . We speculate that the difference might lie in the type of navigation that the two classes of animals use . Therefore , mammals must employ a flexible encoding that can be updated as different environments are explored . The position integrating neurons in these insects are also predicted to have sinusoidal activation patterns . Further investigation of this possibility would require a different set of principles than those selected here . Our work still has some unaddressed limitations , in particular regarding the topology of the activity . Further studies would be required to investigate the full effects of

[ABSTRACT] Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin , both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control . Our results suggest that Cisd , probably iron-depleted Cisd , operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target . Complete loss of Cisd , in contrast , rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability , wing posture , dopamine levels , lifespan , and mitochondrial ultrastructure . We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients . Overexpressing Cisd , the Drosophila ortholog of CISD1 , and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan . Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain . CISD1 , a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein , is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination . The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge . This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies . In this conformation CISD1 can not coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In line with a toxic function of Cisd and apo-Cisd , removing fly Cisd by KO of the coding sequence completely protected flies against Pink1 depletion-induced changes in climbing ability , abnormal wing posture , dopamine levels , and lifespan but ameliorated only the climbing ability and wing posture in Prkn mutant flies . However , CISD1 C83S , a genetically engineered CISD1 incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster and probably also incapable of forming a disulfide bond , has a higher propensity for dimer formation when analyzed in a cellular assay based on complementation of split luciferase ( Figure 2A ) . While our study suggests a role in redox imbalance and iron dysregulation , particularly implicating the iron-depleted form of CISD1 , Ham et al. , 2023 , describe its impact on ER calcium release , and Martinez et al. , 2024 , propose interference with autophagy/mitophagy . Very recent work , published during the revision of this manuscript , discovered that both genetic and pharmacological suppression of CISD1 and Cisd restored increased calcium release from the ER conferred by PINK1 and Parkin mutation in mammalian cells and flies . very recently reported that Cisd depletion using RNAi protects against Pink1 and Prkn loss of function in flies , suggesting that a reduction , instead of a complete KO , of Cisd as used by us is more beneficial in Park25 flies and equally beneficial in Pink1B9 flies . Others reproduced these findings and reported that overexpression of mitoferrin , a mitochondrial iron transporter , mitigates the reduced mitochondrial aconitase activity , abnormal wing posture , flight deficits , and mitochondrial morphology defects associated with Pink1 loss of function by elevating mitochondrial bioavailable iron levels . In summary , our results suggest that the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster protein Cisd is downstream of the pathophysiological cascade initiated by Pink1 and partially Prkn loss of function in flies and probably also in humans . Association with IREs in the 5 ' untranslated region of ferritin mRNA inhibits ferritin translation resulting in less bound iron and an increase in free iron while association with IREs in the 3 ' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the iron importers transferrin receptor 1 and SLC11A2 stabilizes the mRNAs and facilitates their translation resulting in increased iron import . The iron-sulfur cluster of CISD1 is easily lost because it is coordinated in an unconventional manner by one histidine ( H ) and three cysteines ( C ) instead of the more common 2H/2C or 4C coordination . So it appears possible that either this transfer is inhibited/attenuated or that the apo-CISD1/Cisd observed in PINK1 mutant dopaminergic neurons and Pink1 mutant flies constitutes a permanently fixed apo-CISD1/Cisd that can not be reconstituted . We here identified the mitochondrial protein CISD1 , specifically its iron-depleted form , as a potential downstream mediator of the pathophysiological effects arising from the loss of PINK1 function , and to a certain extent , Parkin loss of function . We did not assess whether this increased even more in older cultures but such an age-dependent increase would be in line with the fact that PD usually becomes symptomatic at an older age . Our investigation revealed that both dopaminergic neurons from familial PD patients with PINK1 mutations and Pink1 mutant flies exhibit increased levels of a slower-migrating form of CISD1/Cisd on immunoblots . Based on our experiments , we conclude that the slower-migrating form of CISD1/Cisd corresponds to a dimer caused by the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond between two molecules of CISD1/Cisd . This was evident in WT and Pink1 mutant flies and overexpression of apo-Cisd was associated with a more profound reduction in climbing speed and resulted in an inability to completely inflate their wings . Previous work demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of Cisd in muscle decreased the lifespan of flies and resulted in enlarged mitochondria containing numerous

The disease is caused by mutations in two genes that control the activity of the mitochondria .

This complex binds to iron and helps to maintain the integrity of mitochondrial structures . However , it is not clear how this complex works . In humans , Parkinson’S disease is often caused by genetic mutations that cause the disease to become more severe . Parkinson’ S disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain , which are responsible for the ability of the brain to function properly . It is thought that the mutation in the PTEN protein , CISD1 , can cause Parkinson's disease in humans and other animals .

Now , Wang et al . have used genetically engineered flies to study the effect of a genetic mutation on the structure and function of the iron-silicon complex in the mitochondrial structure of the fly .

[ABSTRACT] This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes , but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions . Critically , the host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase ( SVP ) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males , with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP . Here , we made the surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype , suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54 . Importantly , we clarify how SAP54 , by targeting SVP , heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males , thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects . The molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes - where genetic information of one organism is manifested as traits in another - remain largely unclear . Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle . SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular 'matchmaker ' , helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves . This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54 , produced by parasitic phytoplasmas , in attracting leafhopper vectors . This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed svp null mutant plants over those not exposed to males . However , we previously demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves and the leaf-like flowers were not required . We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males . SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants . Obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts . In contrast , this phytoplasma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] However , emerging research has begun to shed light on the roles of SVP outside of flowering : for instance , it acts as a positive regulator of age-related resistance against bacterial pathogens in Arabidopsis thaliana and serves as a negative regulator of various Jasmonate Zim-domain ( JAZ ) genes during the vegetative growth phase . However , given that the removal of males from SAP54 leaves prior to female choice does not enhance female colonization ( comparison of Figure 1 treatment 4 with treatment 5 ) , we can not exclude that male produced volatiles or mating calls can enhance or supplement SAP54-dependent changes in biotic stress responses to males for enhanced female attraction . The observation that female leafhoppers prefer to reproduce on both SAP54 and svp mutant plants exclusively in the presence of leafhopper males underscores a sophisticated regulatory effect of SVP and other MADS-box transcription factors targeted by SAP54 on plant responses to the different sexes of the herbivores . Moreover , plant immune responses initiated by the molecular patterns associated with insect eggs ( EAMPs ) that bear similarities to pattern-triggered immunity ( PTI ) activated by bacterial pathogens may play a role in the observed gender-specific differences . While the differences in male and female behavior may play a role , there is also the possibility that effectors in the saliva of sap-feeding insects modulate plant processes , including defence , and sex-specific differences exist in the proteome of sap-feeding insect saliva , potentially influencing plant response . Such findings underscore the complexity of tripartite plant-insect-microbe interactions , wherein parasitic genes exhibit what could be termed 'hyper-extended phenotypes , ' manipulating the biology of one host to facilitate transmission through another host . Leafhopper females exhibited a preference for reproducing on svp null mutant plants , a behavior that is also contingent upon the presence of leafhopper males , and aligning with our observation that SAP54 mediates the degradation of SVP in leaves . Our results suggest that female leafhopper preference for laying eggs on male-exposed SAP54 plants is unlikely to depend solely on volatiles originating from the males or induced by them ( Figure 1-figure supplement 3 ) . Our findings contribute to this expanding body of knowledge , suggesting that plant immunity may be intricately controlled by developmental regulators like SVP , which possesses multiple , diverse functions throughout plant development . It is possible that the attraction of insect vectors to leaves is the primary function of SAP54 , and the induction of the leaf-like flowers an evolutionary side-effect of SAP54 adaptation to target MTFs that leads to degradation of SVP . Within the EES framework , parasitic genes like SAP54 evolve adaptively through both natural selection and direct biochemical interactions with plant regulators , as well as through the extended functions these regulators serve in interactions with insect vectors . In our research , we have uncovered a mechanism whereby the phytoplasma effector SAP54 targets a conserved host regulator , SVP , to attract female leafhopper vectors to produce more progeny on plants exposed to leafhopper males . Thus , it is plausible that females are guided to male-occupied SAP54 and svp mutant plants through a different mechanism , possibly involving changes in leaf responses that are specifically induced to male insects . For example , the bacterial parasite infecting the crustacean Daphnia magna selectively uses male hosts for horizontal transmission , while exploiting females for internal replication and spore production , thus facilitating widespread disease transmission . An explanation of this apparent

They are a group of bacteria that cause a variety of diseases , such as malaria , tuberculosis and zoonotic diseases . One of the most common types of parasite is short vegetative phase ( SVP ) , which is produced by the parasite . SVP is a protein that helps plants to attract male leafhoppers to their leaves . It is thought that the SVP protein is responsible for attracting female leafhopper males to the leaves of the plant , but it was not known how this process is carried out . To investigate this question , Wang et al . studied the role of SAP54 , a gene that is produced in the leaves , in attracting leafhopper females to a particular plant . Wang also found that SAP54 is required for the female leaf to be attracted to the plants of the host . These findings suggest that the virulence protein SAP54 plays an important role in promoting female attraction to the leaf . Further research is needed to understand how SAP54 affects the ability of the leaf to attract females and how it can be used to help the female to find her mate ."

[ABSTRACT] At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure ( a time when tolerance is measurable ) , surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations : one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins , rRNA processing machinery , and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity , termed the Ribo-dominant ( Rd ) state ; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes , termed the Stress-dominant ( Sd ) state . To better characterize this cytoprotective tolerance program at the molecular single-cell level , we used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish their subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs . Current antifungal treatments fail , at least in part , because C. albicans can initiate a strong drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration . We provide evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response ( RASTR ) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival . Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage with distinct metabolic and stress responses . Candida albicans , an opportunistic human pathogen , poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with significant socio-economic burden . This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Here , by examining cellular trajectories across populations in a high-throughput manner , we obtained new insights into time-sensitive processes , such as the emergence of drug tolerance during 2-3 days of drug exposure and the existence of cells with Rd and Sd states , which reflect two different cellular states within the RASTR response described as a molecular signature of an S. cerevisiae stress response . Specifically , this study refines published bulk transcriptome studies by differentiating between genes , pathways , and responses that are expressed universally in all cells , and those that are restricted to specific subpopulations . The use of a nanoliter droplet-based assay adapted for fungal cells enabled a detailed sc analysis of C. albicans in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs over a period of days . If the Rd response proves generalizable to other drug treatments , disrupting the Rd to Sd tolerance transition or the Sd response itself could represent an innovative therapeutic approach for other antifungal treatments . The assay was cost-effective and encountered minimal issues or failed runs . Studies of thousands of individual cells enriched our understanding of community structure and population heterogeneity .

One of the most common forms of fungal infection is Candida albicans , which causes a variety of diseases including cancer , heart disease , diabetes , Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s . However , it is not clear exactly how this disease affects the human population . The bacteria that cause this disease are known as fungal cells . These cells are made up of a group of proteins called the ribosomes that make up the RNA . When a cell is exposed to an antifungal drug , these proteins are activated . This process is called the ‘ribosomal assembly stress response’ , or ‘RASTR’ for short . RASTR is a protein that helps the cells to survive in the presence of the drug . It is also known as the ‘Ribodominant’ state , because it is the first time that a fungal cell has been exposed to a drug that can kill it . But it is unclear how this reaction works .

[ABSTRACT] In an idealized model , the census population size determines both this minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged , and the amount of neutral diversity . We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations , as well as the Effective Number of Codons , to show that the protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder . Empirically , an 'effective population size ' is often estimated from the amount of putatively neutral genetic diversity and is assumed to also capture a species ' effectiveness of selection . However , past metrics that compare codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in % GC content and/or amino acid composition . Here , we propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ) , based on Kullback-Leibler divergence , that corrects for both confounders . A potentially more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons . The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits variation among species in the effectiveness of selection .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] However , we have not ruled out a role for selection for higher % GC in ways that are general rather than restricted to coding regions , whether in shaping mutational biases or the extent of gene conversion , or even at the single-nucleotide level in a manner shared between coding regions and intergenic regions . A direct effect of ISD on fitness agrees with studies of random Open Reading Frames ( ORFs ) in Escherichia coli , where fitness was driven more by amino acid composition than % GC content , after controlling for the intrinsic correlation between the two . Note that if a species were to experience a sudden reduction in census population size , for example due to habitat loss , leading to less effective selection , it would take some multiple of the neutral coalescent time for CAIS to fully adjust . Both CAIS and ENC can also be estimated for far more species because they do not require polymorphism or mutation rate data , nor tRNA gene copy numbers and abundances , but only a single complete genome . Similarly , while it might be useful to control for dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequencies , to avoid circularity these would need to be taken from intergenic sequences , with care needed to avoid influence from unannotated protein-coding genes or even pseudogenes . However , this can be reconciled in a model in which highly disordered sequences are less likely to be found in high-Ne species , but the sequences that are present tend to have slightly higher disorder than their low-Ne homologs . We restricted our analysis to only the best annotated genomes , in part to ensure the quality of intergenic % GC estimates , and in part limited by the feasibility of running linear mixed models with 6 million datapoints . We thus capture the extent of adaptation in codon bias , including translational speed , accuracy , and any intrinsic preference for GC over AT that is specific to coding regions . It is important that no additional variable such as GC content or amino acid frequencies creates a spurious correlation by affecting both CAIS and our property of interest . It is possible that the reason that we obtained correlations when we controlled for genome-wide GC content , but not when we controlled for local GC content , is also that codon adaptation adjusts slowly relative to the timescale of fluctuations in local GC content . The GC content pertinent to this expectation depends primarily on mutation bias and GC-biased gene conversion , but potentially also on selection on individual nucleotide substitutions that is hypothesized to favor higher % GC . Codon adaptation metrics more directly quantify how species vary in their exquisiteness of adaptation , than do estimates of effective population size that are based on neutral polymorphism . First vs. second vs. third codon positions have different nucleotide usage on average , but while correcting for this might be useful for comparing genes , correcting for it while comparing species might remove the effect of interest . High ISD might help mitigate the trade-off between affinity and specificity in protein-protein interactions ; non-specific interactions might be short-lived due to the high entropy associated with disorder , which specific interactions are robust to . This approach shows that the same Pfam domain tends to be more disordered when found in a well-adapted species ( i. e. a species with a higher CAIS or ENC ) . These remaining codon-adaptive factors do not create a statistically convincing correlation between CAIS and GC ( Figure 3C ) , nor between ENC and GC ( Figure 3B ) , although CAI is strongly correlated with GC ( Figure 3A ) . We chose vertebrates partly due to the abundance of suitable data , and partly as a stringent test case , given past studies finding limited evidence for codon adaptation . To detect ISD as a novel property under selection
[METHODS] ",,883,93,None,"The genome of a living organism is made up of hundreds of thousands of genes . Each gene has a specific set of instructions that must be translated into a protein . This is called the codon , and it is used to make proteins . However , it is not clear how many codons are in a gene . The theory of evolution posits that a species’ population size is determined by the amount of genetic diversity , but it is often wrong . For example , a population size of tens of millions of species is a measure of how many genes are in the genome . In this way , the population size can be calculated by comparing the number of codon positions in fewer genes , or by using a method called the Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ) . CAIS is based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence theory , which states that if a single species has more than one codon in its genome , its population size will be less than the population sizes of all other species . It also states that the population density of the species is the most important factor in determining how many species have the same codon position . To test this idea , Wang et al . used a mathematical model to estimate the population number of species , using the CAIS method . Using the model , they found that , in the case of the smallest number of genes in the population , there are more codon locations in the protein than in the average number of copies of the gene , suggesting that the species may be more likely to have fewer copies of their genes compared to the average population size . These findings suggest that the abundance of genetic variation in the genes that encode the proteins is an important factor that determines"

[ABSTRACT] In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis , local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed E. coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released . An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) that is released by inflamed host cells and tissues , and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner . ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils , potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity . Using genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) , we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane . In addition , impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane notably contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death . Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses , resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival . Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation . Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO . This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis . In addition , bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ) . Here , we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] As we focused on the laboratory BW25113 E. coli strain , it remains to be elucidated if impaired outer membrane integrity and bacterial death are also of such importance in other gramneg or also grampos bacteria . These findings have the potential to lead to the development of novel treatments for abdominal sepsis , e. g. , by in vitro generated OMV that modulate neutrophil function via delivery of inhibitors to intracellular purinergic receptors during sepsis . Despite low rates of bacterial death during exponential growth , and a low ratio of dead to live bacteria , the high gradient between intra- and extracellular ATP might be sufficient to explain the amount of released ATP measured . Activation of neutrophils in response to ATP-loaded OMV resulted in upregulation of inflammatory , lysosomal , and neutrophil degranulation pathways as well as an upregulation of the apoptosis pathway and genes involved in NETosis by a hitherto unknown mechanism . OMV are promising diagnostic molecular biomarkers in gramneg sepsis and it would be of relevance to compare OMV isolated from septic and control patients to assess possible differences in ATP cargo . OMV can therefore be considered as non-living bacteria-resembling highly inflammatory vesicles that effectively distribute ATP throughout the body to activate cells , such as neutrophils , initiating systemic inflammatory responses . This is supported by lower ATP release in the cyoB mutant , which harbors all three prosthetic groups of the cytochrome bo3 oxidase and is therefore indispensable for proper function . Conversely , we used flow cytometry , a quantitatively more sensitive method , and our data demonstrated that impaired membrane integrity and bacterial death are critical for ATP release during growth . Potentially , despite the lack of a transporter , ATP may similarly to eukaryotic cells leak across the inner membrane into the periplasmic space that lacks the enzymes for ATP generation . The approach to load OMV with ATP is rather artificial ; it is , however , the only way to assure that ATP-loaded and empty OMV only differ in their ATP cargo . Such remote degranulation in response to OMV is unlikely to control bacteria at the source of sepsis but rather harmful to host tissues increasing sepsis severity . Different types of OMV have been described in recent years , e. g. , outer-inner membrane vesicles ( O-IMV ) or explosive OMV , which are composed of outer membrane , inner membrane , and cytoplasmic content . It remains unclear whether loss of ATP results directly in bacterial death or bacterial death is the direct result of impaired outer bacterial membrane stability and ATP release is secondary to bacterial death . ATP synthase is most likely dominant compared to cytochrome bo3 oxidase because of its non-redundant function for ATP generation and bacterial growth . Previous studies used Sytox/PI staining and microscopy to identify bacterial death and did not identify bacterial death as a relevant source of extracellular ATP during exponential growth . However , since the inner membrane and ATP generation remains intact and the periplasmic space is considered generally devoid of ATP , the latter seems more likely . ATP is likely to activate P2 receptors , which have been shown to be expressed in lysosomes , such as P2X1 , P2X3 , or P2X4 . Bacterial ATP reduces neutrophil counts , activates the endolysosomal system , and upregulates neutrophil degranulation , which together increase the severity of abdominal infection and early sepsis . Several open questions need to be addressed in future projects : It remains to be determined how OMV are physiologically loaded with ATP . In this study , we have demonstrated that ATP release is dependent on the respiratory chain located at the inner bacterial membrane . Instability of the outer bacterial membrane
[METHODS] ",,917,94,None,"The bacteria that cause sepsis are known as gramneg bacteria . These bacteria are found in many different parts of the body , including the stomach , the intestines , and the lungs . The bacteria release extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) into the bloodstream , which is then transported to the cells that cause the disease . This ATP is released by bacteria in the form of vesicles , or outer membranes . In the bacterial membrane , a protein called ATP synthase breaks down the ATP and releases it into the cells . When a bacterial cell breaks down ATP it releases a small amount of ATP into the cell . However , it is not clear how ATP releases from the cell and how it is released . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a mouse model of sepses to study how bacteria release ATP from the inside of a bacteria , called Escherichia coli . A mutant strain of E . coli contained an enzyme that produces ATP in the outer membrane . Wang flies the mouse model and shows that bacterial ATP release is dependent on the enzyme that creates ATP within the inner bacterial envelope . It is also possible that a mutation in the enzyme causes the bacteria to release more ATP than normal , suggesting that the bacteria may have a role in the development of new treatments ."

[ABSTRACT] Linear mixed model and a novel structural equation modeling ( SEM ) method that allows estimation of both components and factors were used to estimate the joint effects of cognitive phenotypes polygenic scores ( PGSs ) , familial and neighborhood socioeconomic status ( SES ) , and supportive environment on NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence and PLEs . Using large-scale longitudinal data , we tested the relationships of genetic and environmental factors ( such as familial and neighborhood environment ) with cognitive intelligence and their relationships with current and future PLEs in children . Our findings have policy implications in that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children . Specifically , cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs , with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs . Maladaptive cognitive functioning , influenced by genetic and environmental factors , is hypothesized to mediate the relationship between these factors and childhood PLEs . In children , psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ) are related to risk of psychosis , schizophrenia , and other mental disorders . We leveraged large-scale multimodal data of 6 , 602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study . Our findings indicate that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs are significantly associated with lower PGSs for cognitive phenotypes , lower familial SES , lower neighborhood SES , and less supportive environments . We adjusted for ethnicity ( genetically defined ) , schizophrenia PGS , and additionally unobserved confounders ( using computational confound modeling ) . This study underscores the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through their effects on cognitive intelligence .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Genetic variants associated with CP and EA are related to complex traits across the life span , including neuroticism , depressive symptoms , smoking in adulthood , cognitive decline at a later age , risk for Alzheimer 's disease , brain volume , area , and thickness , as well as psychotic disorders . While policy implications in observational studies like ours might be limited , our findings show the importance of comprehensive approaches considering the entire ecosystem of children 's lives-including residential , family , and school environment-for future research aimed to enhance children 's intelligence and mental health . Although the ABCD Study aimed to achieve its representativeness by recruiting from an array of school systems located around each of the 21 research sites , chosen for their diversity in geography , demographics , and SES , it is not fully representative of the US population . This observation also supports the well-established relationships of the EA PGS with socioeconomic and life-course outcomes , voter turnout , BMI , income , time spent watching television , geographic residence , and wealth inequality , which may be influenced by unobserved environmental factors . For example , the Health Impact in 5 Years Initiative of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes 14 evidence-based interventions , such as providing school-based prevention programs , public transportation , home improvement loans , and earned income tax credits , to tackle the social determinants of public health . While prior research has emphasized the dominant role of family SES ( e. g. , family income ) , our SEM analyses ( IGSCA ) showed that positive environmental factors such as supportive parenting and schooling have a greater impact on children 's PLEs . Our results support the model that genetic factors ( PGS for cognitive phenotypes ) , socioeconomic conditions , and family and school environments may influence cognitive intelligence in children , and this impact may lead to the individual variability of the current and future PLEs in children . Recent research supports this notion , showing that interventions that promote supportive parenting and inclusive school environments can improve neurocognitive ability , academic performance , and decrease risk behaviors such as drinking and emotional eating . Our study strengthens the idea that an interdisciplinary science-driven , coordinated approach to intervening in the select environmental factors may allow practical improvements in child development , particularly in those who are at a disadvantage . This is in line with prior research showing that intervention focused on parenting behavior and school environment have long-lasting positive effects that extend into adulthood and even across generations . Third , the duration of the follow-up period utilized in this study is relatively short ( 1- and 2-year follow-up ) , which may limit the interpretability of our findings for understanding cognitive and psychiatric development during later childhood . First , due to data availability constraints in the ABCD Study , we only utilized baseline observations for NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence , and we could not test whether PLEs might be a mediator of intelligence . Fourth , while we used a wide range of statistical methods to adjust for confounding bias from observed and unobserved variables ( e. g. , genetic ancestry ) , we did not account for other types of potential bias such as sample selection bias . It has been suggested that a holistic and quantitative approach that takes into account the comprehensive ecosystem of family , school , and residential environments may ensure policy effects and efficient use of resources . Such comprehensive analysis contributes to assessing the relative importance of various factors influencing children 's cognition and mental

[ABSTRACT] Overall , our results show that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development . Within telencephalic regions , FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons , thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity . We used hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro platform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation . We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity , leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids . The roles of FGF signaling and its effector genes remain poorly characterized in human experimental models mimicking early fetal telencephalic development . The morphogen FGF8 establishes graded positional cues imparting regional cellular responses via modulation of early target genes . Moreover , FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] It is important to note that the use of a ROCK inhibitor was necessary during early NP dissociation , as significant cell death occurred within 24 hr in its absence , indicating that early human progenitor cells are susceptible to apoptosis when cell contacts are lost , similar to undifferentiated hiPSCs . In this study , we demonstrate that the addition of patterning cues ( FGF8 in this case ) to the culture medium - even when applied in a non-polarized manner - is sufficient to instruct the development of additional regional fates that co-exist and co-develop within the same organoid while maintaining spatial segregation . While dual SMAD inhibition in 2D allows rapid neural induction in just 7 days , subsequent steps in 3D culture promote the formation of reproducible brain-like cellular architectures , including rosettes and neural epithelia , which gradually mature into neurons organized in a cortical plate-like structure . In mice , reduced Fgf8 levels cause progressive telencephalic hypoplasia , as described in Fgf8 hypomorphic and conditional mutants , which show smaller telencephalons due to decreased proliferation , increased apoptosis , and altered expression of areal patterning genes such as Nr2f1 , Pax6 , Emx2 , and Sp8 . As early NPs are dissociated and re-aggregated to form 3D embryoid bodies , this hybrid 2D/3D method could be particularly beneficial for experimental approaches that aim to mix different NP types or cells with distinct genetic backgrounds . The regionalization of the embryonic brain is a multi-step process that operates both sequentially and simultaneously , primarily regulated by localized sources of various signaling molecules that function as organizing centers to pattern neighboring regions and create distinct molecular domains . Although human cerebral organoids do not develop segregated functional areas as in the developing neocortex , we observed that FGF8 can downregulate the expression of posterior cortical genes , like FGFR3 and NR2F1 , while inducing anterior ones , such as ETV1 . This suggests that ASCL1 is not exclusively a marker of cells of ventral origin , particularly within the human telencephalon , where lineage-tracing studies reveal that dorsal progenitors expressing LGE-like markers can also differentiate into GABAergic neurons . In late culture samples , our scRNAseq data revealed the presence of distinct types of human NPs , including HOPX+ outer radial glia ( RG ) cells and , notably , CRYAB+ apical truncated RG cells , which , to our knowledge , have only been identified in a few protocols . We propose that the simple addition of instructing cues ( morphogens ) to the culture medium can enhance the complexity of brain organoids , providing a compromise between maintaining a certain degree of spontaneous self-organization while inducing multiple brain regions in a reproducible manner . However , the global identity of both FGF8-treated and untreated organoids , based on transcriptional similarity to human fetal brain areas , remained aligned with somatosensory and pre-frontal cortical regions , indicating only a limited effect on full A/P areal specification . Severe phenotypic alterations and cross-regulation between anterior ( FGF ) , dorsal ( BMP , WNT ) , and/or ventral ( SHH ) patterning centers in genetic loss-of-function ( LOF ) animal models obscure the specific role of FGF8 signaling in telencephalic development . Despite this precaution , some regions resembling diencephalic and mesencephalic structures still formed in our organoids , likely due to the presence of unspecified NPs at day10 , which might remain responsive to the mesencephalon-inducing effects of FGF8 . For example , dysregulation of FGFR3 leads to Thanatophoric dysplasia , a fatal form of chondrodysplastic dwarfism , characterized by temporal lobe enlargement , abnormal sulci , and hippocampal dysplasia , resulting in cognitive impairments and reduced synaptic plasticity in both patients and mouse models . This electrophysiological profile , with lower firing and network burst rates , aligns with a reduction in excitatory glutamatergic neurons and an increase in inhibitory GABAergic neurons and supports an FGF8-induced shift toward ventral GABAergic identity at the expense of a dorsal glutamatergic identity in telencephalic organoids .
[METHODS] ",,868,92,None,"Cells in the brain are made up of many different types of cells , including neurons , glia , and occipitals . Each cell is made up from a set of genes , each of which is regulated by a signaling protein called FGF8 .

To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called in vitro culture to study how the FGF 8 signaling process influences the brain development of mice . In the experiments , the mice were treated with a drug called SMAD , which inhibits the activity of several genes that are important for the brain to develop . However , it was not clear whether this drug affects other genes involved in the development or development of brain cells . Instead , Zhang eT . found that the Fgf8 signaling effect was directly involved in both the development and development of different brain regions . This suggests that FgF8 is also involved in a number of different aspects of the human brain . For example , Fgif8 can help to regulate the activity and differentiation of different regions of the body , such as the anteroposterior and dorsoventral regions , as well as the balance between the GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons . Wang 's experiments also showed that the treatment of mice with Fgiff8 reduced the activity in the telencephalic regions compared to mice with normal levels of Fgaff8 , suggesting that the effects of the drug on the brain could be linked to other diseases ."

[ABSTRACT] We find that in the 2nd instar larval period ( L2 ) , sleep and feeding are spread across the day ; these behaviors become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage ( L3 ) . In Drosophila , circadian sleep patterns are initiated with formation of a circuit connecting the central clock to arousal output neurons ; emergence of circadian sleep also enables long-term memory ( LTM ) . Finally , we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms . Together , our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors . Forcing mature ( L3 ) animals to adopt immature ( L2 ) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit LTM . In addition , the development of the clock ( DN1a ) -arousal ( Dh44 ) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment . Here , we identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosophila larvae . However , the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown . As diurnal animals mature , feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night . Sleep and feeding patterns lack strong daily rhythms during early life .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our CCHa1 peptide data suggest that Dh44 neurons may undergo changes in CCHa1-R expression or subcellular localization between the L2 and L3 stages : we only observed an increase in Dh44 neural activity in response to the bath application of CCHa1 peptide at the L3 stage ( Figure 4E and F ) . In this model , changes in CCHa1-R subcellular localization allow Dh44 neurons to become competent to receive clock-driven cues , while this or other Dh44-derived signals promote circuit connectivity with DN1as to drive consolidation of sleep at the L3 stage . Additionally , while our study focuses on presumed CCHa1 synaptic signaling between DN1a and Dh44 neurons , we can not rule out the possibility of CCHa1 volume transmission from DN1as or other sources as contributors to sleep-wake regulation . Maintaining energy homeostasis and sensing of the nutritional environment are likely conserved regulators of sleep-wake rhythm development , as young mice exposed to a maternal low-protein diet show disruptions in night-time sleep architecture and energy expenditure later in life . Larval Dh44 neurons may therefore have distinct functions from their adult counterparts for integrating information about the nutritional environment through the direct sensing of glucose levels to modulate sleep-wake rhythm development . Indeed , we observed a disruption of sleep rhythms in L3 when glucose metabolic genes are knocked down in Dh44 neurons , demonstrating that post-synaptic processes likely initiate onset of circadian sleep . Together with our previously published work , our findings support a model in which changes in both overall circuit development and molecular changes in post-synaptic ( Dh44 ) neurons likely drive sleep-wake rhythm circuit development . Interestingly , this increase in activity is absent in low nutrient conditions ( Figure 4G ) suggesting that the larval nutritional environment may also modulate CCHa1-R localization or expression . It is , of course , possible to affect both sleep and feeding behaviors with the same manipulation ( e. g. activation of NPF +neurons ) underscoring that they are highly inter-connected behaviors . We report that the development of sleep-circadian circuits depends on organisms achieving sufficient nutritional status to support the consolidation of deep sleep at night ( Figure 5-figure supplement 3 ) . Future work will leverage the larval system to examine how sleep-wake and feeding circuitry communicate to balance these rhythmic behaviors across developmental periods . While larvae can not eat when they are sleeping , we have observed distinct effects of certain manipulations on sleep behaviors but not feeding . Nutritional environment and energetic status exert profound effects on sleep patterns during development , but mechanisms coupling sleep to these factors remain undefined . These findings raise intriguing questions for how changes in an organism 's energetic and nutritional state influence sleep-circadian circuit development . Our findings demonstrate that larvae exhibit both sleep-wake and feeding daily rhythms at the L3 stage , but not earlier . For example , knockdown of Hex-C in Dh44 neurons disrupts sleep rhythms with no obvious effect on feeding behavior ( Figure 5D ) . Our data demonstrate that larval Dh44 neurons require glucose metabolic genes but not amino acid sensing genes to modulate sleep-wake rhythms . Regardless , our data open avenues for future work on the molecular and subcellular mechanisms regulating DN1a-Dh44 circuit development . There are no available antibodies or endogenous fluorescent reporters of CCHa1-R , limiting our ability to examine receptor subcellular localization . Perhaps larval Dh44 neurons respond to an increase in glucose levels in the environment by promoting CCHa1-R localization to the membrane . This raises the obvious question of whether sleep and feeding are opposite sides of the same coin .
[METHODS] ",,866,92,None,"The circadian rhythms of sleep and feeding are known as the “circadian sleep” . In the fruit fly Drosophila , the circadian sleep is based on a system of neurons called neurons that communicate with each other to control how the animal sleeps . The neurons in the larvae of the fruit flies communicate with one another through a series of signals , called synapses . These signals are sent to the brain via a circuit called the arousal circuit , which is made up of neurons . This circuit is called the clock , and it is important to understand how this circuit works . However , it is not clear how the clock and the underlying circuit work together .

[ABSTRACT] When reaching their maximum sustained swimming speed , fish swimming in schools had a 44 % higher maximum aerobic performance and used 65 % less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary individuals , which lowered the TEE and total cost of transport by up to 53 % , near the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism . The non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance which is likely to be beneficial for evading predators . By characterizing both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools of giant danio ( Devario aequipinnatus ) , we discovered that fish schools have a concave upward shaped metabolism-speed curve , with a minimum metabolic cost at ~1 body length s-1 . Many animals moving through fluids exhibit highly coordinated group movement that is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion . We demonstrate that fish schools reduce total energy expenditure ( TEE ) per tail beat by up to 56 % compared to solitary fish . However , direct energetic measurements demonstrating the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements remain elusive . These energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes . Fish in schools also recovered from exercise 43 % faster than solitary fish .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The direct link between higher energetic costs caused by a higher 3-D body angle and higher turning frequency at the lowest speeds in solitary danio ( Figure 4D , E ) supports previous results in skates where energetic costs are high at the very low swimming speeds due to the increased energetic cost involved in maintaining body stability and generating lift in negatively buoyant fishes . While we can not completely preclude the possibility that elongation of danio fish school might be due to the weaker individuals falling behind , the fact that the school maintained a stable 3-D distance as speed increased and that fish continued to change position within the school suggests that the elongated school volume at higher speeds may reflect changing hydrodynamic interactions among individuals ( Figure 1 ) . We expect more species that move in the fluid to show a higher postural cost in near-still fluid but careful measurements of both body kinematics and position along with high-resolution respirometry and accurate low-speed flow control will be required to demonstrate this phenomenon in a diversity of fish species . Although these studies appear to suggest that the energetic benefits of schooling are scalable , we are still some ways from proving the exact mechanisms of how the large school size in nature is coordinated and whether or not local interactions are still one of the mechanisms for energy saving when scaling up school size . Although reduced fTB has been used in past studies as an indirect indicator of energy saving in fishes , we caution that fTB is not necessarily an indicator of energy use in group dynamics where fish constantly and dynamically interact with complex vortices and flow generated by other individuals . Collectively , our results showed that the increased aerobic performance ( Figure 2C ) and the reduced use of the aerobic capacity ( Figure 2E ) for swimming above 50 % Ucrit in fish schools likely plays a key role in reducing the use of glycolysis and the accumulation of lactate ( e. g. EPOC , Figure 2G ) for high-speed swimming . This suggests that analyses of fish energy use as speed increases would benefit from increasing the number of tested speeds , and that efforts to extend speed measurements to both the lowest and highest speeds would enable a greater level of precision in measuring fish locomotor performance . Therefore , the benefits of reducing the energetic cost of locomotion are likely not major factors underlying behaviors such as low-speed milling and aggregation in fishes , where other ecological drivers such as feeding , predator avoidance , and reproduction likely dominate the fitness landscape . Further studies will need to explore whether individuals within the school are more frequently located at points recommended by the Lighthill conjecture which could potentially result in minimum metabolic costs of locomotion at Uopt in fish schools . By simultaneously measuring kinematics and energetics , we discovered a downshifted performance curve of TEE per tail beat in fish schools at higher speeds ( Figure 3A ) , even with limited alteration in fTB at lower swimming speeds within the school . Moreover , danio do not show intermittent swimming gaits at low speed as observed in some labriform swimmers , and hence gait-specific kinematics most likely do not play a role in the elevated locomotion cost that we observe at the lowest speeds . Moreover , after the highest swimming speeds immediately followed by an active recovery process , fish likely prioritize the recovery of the essential functions ( as the levels of the neurotransmitters decline fairly rapidly ) for the potential of repeated locomotion performance ( speedy recovery allows fish to restore their swimming performance ) . We also demonstrated that the need for energy saving in fish schools at lower speeds ( < 3 BL s-1 or 38 % Ucrit Figures
[METHODS] ",,899,93,None,"The body of a fish is made up of many individuals , including the fishes that live in the water . The fisheses are able to swim at high speeds , but they also have a tendency to move at a slower rate than other animals . This is because they are more likely to move faster than other fish , and they are less likely to be attacked by predators . One way that fish can reduce their energy use is by moving in groups of individuals together , which is thought to reduce the amount of energy they use . However , it is not clear how this is achieved . To investigate this , Wang et al . used a technique called X-ray crystallography to measure the energy use of fish in a group of giant danio , a species of fish that lives in the ocean . In the experiments , the fish swam at high speed , with a maximum speed of 1 . 5 mph . When the fish reached their maximum speed he used 65% less energy than when the fish was alone . Wang also found that the fish used less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary fish . These results suggest that fish schools can reduce energy use by up to 56% . Moreover , fish swimming in schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than those swimming alone , near the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism . Overall , these findings suggest that the energy-saving benefits of schooling are largely due to the large school size in nature . Further studies are needed to understand how the large group of fish can conserve energy ."

[ABSTRACT] We examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ; as a model of blood derived macrophages ) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung . Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ driven cytokine production in AM , indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM , which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis . Airway macrophages ( AM ) are the predominant immune cell in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection , making them a target for host directed therapy . Directly comparing responses between macrophages , AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM . A knowledge gap remains in understanding metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations , especially in lung resident AM . These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM . Upon stimulation , AM do not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM which shift to 'Warburg'-like metabolism . These data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases . Human macrophages , regardless of origin , had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or upon stimulation . MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40 , whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis . Interestingly , TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM . IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation . Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism . IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While we have established herein that the human AM is plastic in response to IFN-γ , since the AM is yolk-sac derived and long-lived , this raises the question of whether the plasticity of the AM can allow multiple sequential changes to respond and adapt to changing microenvironments in the lung . Our data demonstrates that cytokine production in human AM can be promoted by supporting cellular metabolism , thus providing evidence that human tissue resident AM are a tractable target for host-directed immuno-supportive adjunctive therapies . Future experiments should examine how virulent respiratory pathogens such as gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Mtb affect human AM in Th1 or Th2 environments , to determine infection-specific effects . Our data supports the hypothesis that there may be distinct roles for AM and infiltrating MDM during infection since IFN-γ increased metabolic responses are mechanistically associated with different cellular functions . Cumulatively , the data presented herein suggests that the MDM maybe more phenotypically plastic than the AM , while the AM have enhanced functional plasticity in their ability to produce cytokine after exposure Th1 and Th2 cytokines . Furthermore , only one dose of IFN-γ was utilised due to limitations in AM yield ; however , recently both low and high doses of IFN-γ have been shown to have similar effects on AM in vitro . Blocking oxidative phosphorylation with oligomycin reduced LPS induced cytokine secretion in the human AM and not MDM , both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation may therefore be needed for optimal AM function . Nevertheless , these data address knowledge gaps in human macrophage biology and are required to aid the translation of immunometabolism into clinical benefits in respiratory medicine . The inhibition of glycolysis with 2DG can not definitively link all observations solely to glycolysis , as limiting glycolysis will ultimately limit oxidative phosphorylation . The concentration of 2DG used only partially inhibited glycolysis ; however , ablation of glycolysis induces significant cytotoxicity and confounds assay outcomes . Another question raised is whether other tissue resident macrophages behave similarly to AM or whether they have unique responses . Establishing the immunometabolic and functional outputs of human macrophages will aid in future work examining the plasticity of the human AM . We acknowledge that our in vitro model is simplified and may not fully reflect macrophages in vivo . Human AM and infiltrating MDM both increase glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in response to IFN-γ , and stimulation results in a further increase in glycolysis . Therefore , where 2DG had no effect , a role for glycolysis can not be definitively excluded . We used LPS and irradiated Mtb to model successful macrophage responses to infection .
[METHODS] ",,774,87,None,"The immune system is made up of a group of cells called macrophages . These cells are found in the lung and help to prevent infections . However , they also help to protect the body from infection , which can lead to lung cancer . This is because the immune system tries to control how the immune cells work . In the lung , the immune response is regulated by a protein called IFN- . The protein binds to molecules called cytokines and helps the cells to produce a chemical called a cytokine . When IFN  is activated , a small protein called IL-4 is produced . It is thought that this protein is responsible for the production of cytokinets , but it is not clear how this protein works . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a model of human airway macrophagoid cells ( AMs ) to study the effects of IFN on AMs in the laboratory . AMs were shown to be more plastic than MDM , suggesting that AMs are able to adapt to changes in their environment . They also had a higher level of oxidative phosphorylation , meaning that they are more likely to produce more cytokyines . Interestingly , AMs that were exposed to IFN– were more prone to releasing a type of molecule called TNF . Therefore , these findings suggest that AM may be a target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies ."

[ABSTRACT] We demonstrate that these bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night , by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants , who alter their headings in response . Finally , we show the long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants ' path integration system throughout the night for homing , as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day . Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere , and solar polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals . Furthermore , these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month , even under crescent moons , when polarised light levels are at their lowest . For the first time in any animal , we show that nocturnal bull ants use the exceedingly dim polarisation pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation . The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position ; however , they can often be obstructed by clouds , canopy , or the horizon . Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate . Despite being hidden , these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect . Here , we show evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants . Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun can not guide them . Moonlight produces an analogous pattern , albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] These findings suggest that under the filter , foragers use any available celestial and terrestrial cues that are still visible , yet the weighting of the polarisation pattern appears to change in accordance with the vector state and not its test location close to the nest tree , which could be a potentially highly salient landmark . However , the shift reductions on nights where there was no access to the lunar polarisation cue until just prior to tests ( lunar twilight before moonrise ) , suggests these foragers may need some set period of exposure to the moon 's polarisation pattern to employ it fully during inbound homing . This means that even if the ant fully shifts its heading , the delay will cause our measurements at the filter exit to slightly underestimate each individual 's position since we measure the angle from where the lunar cue changes ( as the filter was placed overhead ) and not the position at which the ant altered its heading . Future work could tackle if a lunar ephemeris function is employed by these ants through exposing or blocking access to the sky and familiar panorama for set time periods when the moon is naturally visible overnight , during waxing gibbous phases . The moonlight pattern only becomes visible in the sky once the moon reaches -18° below the horizon ; thus , waning moon nights present periods when there are neither solar nor lunar cues available to maintain the compass , potentially degrading the compass portion of the vector estimate . While we could have continued to test with smaller portions of the moon 's surface illuminated , a reduction in shift magnitude could result from either physiological limits in detection or 'decisional ' processes in how much weight to accord the cue . While we can not compare solar and moonlight polarisation navigation in outbound ants ( outbound foraging is highly correlated with evening twilight when the solar light would overpower any moonlight polarisation pattern ) , striking similarities occur when comparing solar and moonlight polarisation navigation in ants homing to the nest ( Figure 7 ) . When there are periods overnight when the moon and its polarisation pattern are absent , it is either weighted weakly or the path integrator may become degraded with cues having been interrupted during overnight periods with no detectable celestial cues . This suggests that when the moon is waxing and present throughout the overnight period ( at least until moonset ) , M. midas foragers are continuously tracking it and integrating this compass cue into their path integrator . In this vein , it remains unknown if these ants are tracking their lunar polarisation compass by using a time-compensated lunar compass , or if the compass is updated with reference to other cues , such as the panorama , throughout the night . When we first tested foragers under Waning Full Moons and Waning Quarter Moons they showed clear evidence of attending to the polarisation cue , but shift magnitudes were significantly smaller compared to the Waxing Moon conditions . We also see the same full heading changes to both solar- and moonlight-polarisation-pattern rotations when foragers were released halfway to the nest and tested 2 m with a longer 6 m vector ( Solar : -45° rotation : -35 . In addition to being dimmer , moonlight is less UV-rich compared to direct sunlight , and its spectrum changes across the lunar cycle , with sensitivity to green spectrum within polarised moonlight of potential importance for orientation . Finally , the lack of shifts with No Moon foragers indicates that these navigators do not fall back on memories of the evening or morning solar e-vector when presented one overnight .

[ABSTRACT] Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight , but how this was achieved has been unclear , especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats . These tails ended in a tall , thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight . The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness , allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure . Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass , potentially benefiting flight control . Here , we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs . Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch at the Bayerische Staatssamlung für Paläontologie ( Munich ) , Museum für Naturkunde ( Berlin ) , Jura Museum ( Eichstätt ) , Natural History Museum ( London ) , National Museum of Scotland ( Edinburgh ) , and Royal Ontario Museum ( Toronto ) representing the pterosaur inventories in their care . The skull is partially preserved but severely deformed and eroded , with an outline of the paired ramus ( 70 mm rami length ) and upper crania , retaining anterior dentition with larger teeth ( 14 mm ) displaced anteriorly to the preserved jaws . Out of this significant sample , only four specimens were found to preserve tail vane soft tissues , which were then imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence at the Natural History Museum , National Museum of Scotland , and the Royal Ontario Museum . These specimens were screened without bias regardless of their ontogenetic stage and preservation ( i. e. completeness , degree of articulation and the presence or absence of soft tissues under white light ) . LSF involved projecting a 405 nm violet laser diode from a line lens and scanning it over the specimens in a dark room following standard laser safety protocol . The vertebral column is preserved as modular chunks in partial articulation , composed of presacral vertebrae , sacral vertebrae and over 30 caudal vertebrae in partial articulation ; the filiform of the caudal section disarticulate and splay anteriorly . Ontogenetically , on basis of the size of preserved elements and tail vane morphology , it likely belongs to a similar growth stage to NHMUK PV OR 37787 .

The tail vane is 'stockier ' in comparison to the NHMUK specimens , having a wider anterior opening and measuring 55 mm at its widest section . Long exposure photographs over 30 s were taken with a Nikon digital single-lens reflex camera fitted with a 425 nm laser blocking filter . The skull has a proportionally sizeable orbit while the wing phalange extensor process and pubic fusing point to a late-stage sub-adult ontogenetic stage . The scapula-coracoid pair are preserved separately , with forelimb elements ( humerus , radius , ulna , metacarpal , manual phalanges ) severely deformed or missing . The preserved tail vane is slightly shorter than lower jaw ( 89 mm but incomplete ) , with two features being similar sized . Initially assigned to Rhamphorhynchus muensteri by Goldfuß , 1831 ; followed by R. gemmingi by von Meyer , 1846 ; then re-assessed under label Nr . The skeleton is preserved contorted , seemingly 'biting its tail ' with cervical and dorsal vertebrae falling severely out of articulation . The specimen was later used in 'tail fin ' calculations by O'Brien et al. , 2018 , but remained formally undescribed . The wing phalanges make up a~465 mm long wing ( WP1 = 123 mm , WP2 = ~119 mm , WP3 = ~112 mm , WP4 = 111 mm ) , accumulating to a wingspan of ~1 .

[ABSTRACT] Here , we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine differences in dopamine release as well as mechanisms that underlie differential dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of adolescent ( P28-35 ) and adult ( P70-90 ) male rats . Results herein suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence , involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release . We show baseline differences between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in male rats , as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) on modulating dopamine release . Strikingly , blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that this α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur . These behavioral changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood , but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders . The α6-selective blocker , α-conotoxin , increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats , but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood . Major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie , in part , the associated behavioral changes and increased vulnerability . We confirm the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo using microdialysis . Adolescence is characterized by changes in reward-related behaviors , social behaviors , and decision-making .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Although prior research has found no difference in the density of α6-containing nAChRs in the NAc of early adolescents and adults , differences in localization or functionality of either α6-containing nAChRs or GABA receptors may underlie changes that create this novel multisynaptic mechanism of dopamine regulation in adolescent males . Interestingly , one report using adult mice found that antagonizing GABAB receptors increased dopamine release when β2-containing nAChRs were antagonized , indicating that GABA and nAChRs have a potentially complex and reciprocal regulation of dopamine release that we suggest here may be age/developmental stage dependent . A previous study from our lab using adult rats found that those rats most vulnerable to sensation seeking and markers of SUD display a similar pattern of dopamine release to adolescent rats in the present study , particularly with respect to how α6-containing nAChRs modulated dopamine release . We examined CIN influence on dopamine release under single pulse conditions and in the aggregate magnitude of release attributed to multiple pulses in a burst that mimics 'tonic-like ' or 'phasic-like ' firing conditions ( i. e. not the relative release across individual pulses in a single burst as with the PPR ) . Consistent with our previous findings , we showed no difference in our measure of dopamine uptake ( Vmax ) between adult and adolescent male rats in the NAc , suggesting the rate of dopamine uptake does not drive differences in stimulated dopamine release shown here . Km is traditionally derived from the bottom third of the descending portion of the dopamine curve in FSCV , and electrode adsorption and other artifacts are known to occlude this outcome measure without affecting our other measures . Blocking GABA receptors in adolescent rats unmasked the α-Ctx mediated decrease in dopamine release at single pulse and lower frequency stimulations that is well documented in prior literature and in the current adult rat group . The first is the well-documented direct blocking of α6-containing nAChRs on dopamine varicosities that decreases DA release at low-frequency stimulations ( i. e. the 'masked ' effect in adolescents but present for adults ) . While the affinity of dopamine for the DAT ( i. e. Km ) has been shown to be different in prior publications by other groups , the dopamine curves we generated were optimized for measures of release and Vmax , not baseline affinity measurements ( i. e. Km ) . Thus , the goal of this study was to identify variations in NAc core stimulated dopamine release and pinpoint the mechanism for which these changes may occur in adolescent and adult male rats . The second , and novel mechanism through early adolescence we propose , is an α-Ctx mediated reduction in GABA control of dopamine release that disinhibits dopamine and is responsible for the increase that is specific to adolescent rats . Given no differences in uptake rate or release probability within a burst , we shifted our focus to examining the involvement of heterosynaptic regulators , like cholinergic interneurons ( CIN ) , on local dopamine release . The present study gives us novel insight into age-related differences in dopamine release and its regulation , thus highlighting critical neurochemical targets that may partially underlie these behavioral changes . Given the non-selective nature of electrically evoked dopamine release here , it is possible that additional nearby GABA sources ( compared to optogenetic studies ) released enough GABA to 'outcompete ' the competitive antagonists . PPRs are known to be frequency dependent as we show here , but we find there are no age-related differences in the distribution of release magnitude across pulses in a single burst . It is possible that a similar mechanism of action is mediating the effects seen here , although we did not investigate varying combinations of activation
[METHODS] ",,911,94,None,"Adolescence is a period of time in which the brain begins to develop and develop new behaviors . This process is called adolescent development , and it is thought that this process is triggered by changes in the way the brain responds to stimuli . However , it is not clear how this process works in adulthood . The brain has been shown to release a chemical called dopamine , which is released when the brain is active . Dopamine is released by the brain during the first few years of life , but it is also released during the second and third years of age . It is thought to be involved in a number of different processes , including the release of certain chemicals , such as acetylcholine , a neurotransmitter that helps the brain to make decisions . One of these processes is called GABA . GABA activates receptors in the nucleus accumbens , where the brain receives information about the brain’s activity . When the receptors are activated , dopaminates the brain , making it more likely that the brain will respond to stimules . But it is unclear how this happens .

[ABSTRACT] Thus , our studies demonstrate that genetically distinct ASD subtypes have common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration which are driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation . 2 deletion , have common reductions in neural precursor cell ( NPC ) neurite outgrowth and migration even though whole genome sequencing demonstrates no genetic overlap between the datasets . mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in all NPCs across both ASD subtypes , and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism NPC-associated phenotypes in control NPCs . Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is defined by common behavioral characteristics , raising the possibility of shared pathogenic mechanisms . Surprisingly despite the genetic heterogeneity , hundreds of shared p-peptides were identified between autism subtypes including the mTOR pathway . To identify signaling differences that may contribute to these developmental defects , an unbiased phospho- ( p ) -proteome screen was performed . Surprisingly , our iPSC studies find that six individuals from two distinct ASD subtypes , idiopathic and 16p11 . Yet , vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity suggests personalized phenotypes .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Response to EFs could also have implications for the treatment of individuals with ASD , for example , SSRI are commonly used to treat comorbid depression/anxiety in ASD , but if these individuals have neural cells that are less responsive to 5-HT , this treatment could be less effective , though further research is needed to understand whether NPC responses to EFs/drugs correlate with drug responses in the individual . In our study , we selected three EFs , PACAP , NGF , and 5-HT , known to be expressed during the 'critical window ' of mid-fetal development , with well-established roles in regulation of early neurodevelopmental phenotypes to stimulate I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs in both our neurite outgrowth and neurosphere assays to assess for ASD-specific response differences . Given that the non-overlapping variants could potentially converge onto the mTOR pathway , we subsequently ran IPA on WGS data which did not uncover convergence onto the mTOR pathway or any other classical signaling pathway such as ERK , WNT , or CREB , but did find common alterations in immune regulatory pathways ( Figure 3-figure supplement 4 ) . Furthermore , some studies of syndromic diseases where the driving mutation is not in the mTOR pathway , such as Fragile-X , Angelman , Rett syndrome , and Phelan-McDermid syndrome ( 22q13 deletion ) , also show mTOR alterations in human postmortem samples , embryonic stem cell models , and hiPSC-based models . Preclinical mouse models of Rett syndrome support this concept , as treatment of adult animals with mTOR-activating IGF-1 reduced anxiety levels and increased exploratory behaviors , suggesting that targeting mTOR can have an effect outside of the fetal developmental window . Consistent with the idea that mTOR signaling dysfunction could be a common mechanism for autism , monogenic syndromic disorders , which can exhibit ASD such as tuberous sclerosis ( TSC ) , PTEN-associated ASD , and neurofibromatosis-1 , have mutations that directly affect mTOR pathway components . By conducting experiments with EFs we were able to find two distinct subgroups of ASD which would not have been apparent if we had conducted our experiments in control conditions alone , showing the utility of studying patient-derived cells under different conditions . The extensive rigor of our analyses that included a total of 29 distinct iPSC clones and 61 distinct neural inductions lends to relatively small sample sizes ( though similar to other iPSC studies ) with only six autism probands , three of each subtype . We have not conducted specific studies into the difference between I-ASD and 16pDel when it comes to EF responsiveness , though the p-proteome results provide the above tantalizing clues which could be focused on in future research . Regardless , our study adds to the growing literature that mTOR signaling dysfunction is a shared pathogenic mechanism among different types of ASDs and raises the possibility that mTOR dysregulation could be observed commonly across multiple additional ASD subtypes . While most ASD iPSC studies have investigated terminal neuronal differentiation phenotypes , our study has focused on NPCs and may be the first to find common NPC neurite and migration impairments in two different ASD subtypes . Thus , understanding whether certain subtypes of ASD are responsive to EFs like 5-HT or even medications by using iPSC-derived cells may help us better tailor treatments for ASD and its comorbid conditions . Thus , it is reasonable to postulate that mTOR defects , which in the prenatal period leads to altered neurites or migration , could in the adult brain cause altered dendritic functioning and plasticity which could consequently lead to behavioral symptoms of ASD . Our study is one of the first to show the remarkable convergence of neurodevelopmental and molecular phenotypes in two distinct autism subtypes using rigorous methods such as utilization of multiple iPSC clones and neural inductions . Effectively subtyping ASD would help us uncover the multiple pathways through which ASD can manifest in different individuals , allow us to
[METHODS] ",,879,92,None,"Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is a disorder that affects children in many different ways .

This revealed that the alterations in the mtr1 signaling pathway are common across the different subtype groups , but that the genetic differences in the genes could be a cause of the differences in ASD symptoms .

[ABSTRACT] These high SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous EPSCs , lower voltage thresholds , tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites , shorter response latencies , and higher initial release rates . Here , we aimed at bridging this gap by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization . A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells ( IHCs ) and spiral ganglion neurons ( SGNs ) in the cochlea . While a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity seems likely , experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has remained difficult to obtain . This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs . Presynaptic active zones at the pillar IHC side activate at lower IHC potentials than those of the modiolar side that have more presynaptic Ca2+ channels . Synapses with high spontaneous rate of release ( SR ) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC . The postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates , sound thresholds , and operating ranges . Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Other important factors might explain the higher SR reported in vivo : ( i ) The intrinsic biophysical properties of SGNs which could further expand the firing rate distribution , for instance , due to spikes initiated intrinsically and not activated by an EPSP ; ( ii ) a sampling bias of synapses with SR above 20 sEPSC/s given that they constitute less than 35 % of SGNs from 8- to 17-week-old mice ; and ( iii ) the developmental recruitment of high SR SGNs with age . This might reflect two important technical differences : ( i ) single synapse imaging assessed the presynaptic Ca2+ influx of the specific synapse , while in paired recordings we related release to the whole-cell Ca2+ influx , and ( ii ) the temporal resolution of paired recordings allowed to study the initial release rate using shorter stimuli than in imaging , which avoids an impact of RRP depletion and ongoing SV replenishment . Certainly , caution is to be applied for the comparison of ex vivo and in vivo data due to the partial disruption of the physiological milieu despite our efforts to maintain near-physiological conditions , and the incomplete synaptic maturation when focusing ex vivo experiments on the third postnatal week soon after hearing onset . Parameters such as RRP size ( ~ # spikes of the rapidly adapting component of firing ) , sustained exocytosis ( ~adapted firing rate in vivo ) , recovery of spontaneous and evoked release ( ~recovery from forward masking in vivo ) did not differ among our high and low SR synapses , and contrasts with in vivo data . This threefold difference between ex vivo and in vivo recordings of the same age group could indicate that , in vivo , the IHC resting potential might be more depolarized and/or subject to spontaneous fluctuations that can trigger Ca2+ channel openings and release . Our hypothesis is that , in high SR synapses , a more hyperpolarized Ca2+ channel activation in combination with tighter coupling between the Ca2+ channels and the Ca2+ sensor of fusion would enable a faster response with a greater initial SV release probability for a given stimulus . The sensitivity and temporal resolution of paired recordings further allowed us to classify the synapses based on their spontaneous rate and support the hypothesis that high SR SGNs receive input from AZ with tighter coupling than low SR SGNs . The SR range observed in our paired recordings from mouse afferent synapses ( 0-18 sEPSC/s ) agrees with results obtained without patch-clamping the IHC ( 0-16 sEPSC/s ) and with previous ex vivo reports using loose patch recordings from SGNs of p15-17 rats . Paired pre- and postsynaptic patch-clamp recordings ( this work ) and single synapse imaging of presynaptic Ca2+ signals and glutamate release jointly found a lower apparent Ca2+ cooperativity in pillar synapses during depolarizations within the range of receptor potentials . On the contrary , mean EPSC amplitudes in hearing mice remained small ( around -100 pA ) in resting conditions , but became significantly larger upon stimulation with 40 mM K+ or voltage depolarizations ( the present study , Figure 1-figure supplement 1G ) . In the framework of the univesicular hypothesis of spontaneous release , the flickering of the fusion pore , prior to or instead of full collapse fusion of the SV , might be favored in low SR synapses , leading to slower sEPSC rise times and a lower percentage of monophasic sEPSCs . However , higher release probability with comparable RRP size explains higher initial release rates , which likely explain the faster and temporally more precise postsynaptic depolarization that is likely to turn into shorter first spike latencies and lower first spike latency jitter . Next to providing support for the presynaptic hypothesis of functional SGN diversity , the present study
[METHODS] ",,898,93,None,"Neurons in the brain are made up of many different cells , each of which has a specific function . In the brain , the inner hair cells ( IHCs ) and spiral ganglion neurons ( SGNs for short ) are a group of neurons that work together to encode sounds . They are also known as afferent synapses , and they are found in the cochlea and other parts of the body . These neurons are found on the outer side of the brain and are surrounded by a network of nerve cells . The inner hair cell is a part of the SGN network , but it is not clear how these neurons work together . To investigate this question , Wei et al . used a technique called ex vivo imaging to record the activity of the inner head cells and SGN neurons in mice . This allowed us to compare the activity and activity of these neurons in a way that was similar to that of a synapse . We then used this technique to study how the neurons respond to different stimuli , such as sound , light , or noise . Using this technique , we were able to identify a set of neurons with high spontaneous rate of release ( SR ) , which is the rate at which a neuron releases a chemical called Ca2+ . It was also found that the SR was higher in the pillar IHC than the modiolar IHC , a region of the IHC that has more presynaptic channels . Further experiments showed that SR is higher than normal in the modifiable IHC but lower in the postiolar SGN . Overall , this suggests that the differences in the activity between the inner and postitial SGN are due to differences"

[ABSTRACT] In this study , using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches , we demonstrate that PfMORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle , but is also essential to the parasite survival . Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) experiments suggests that PfMORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but may also play a role in modulating stage transition . Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture ( Hi-C ) studies indicate that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death . The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite , Plasmodium falciparum , faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation . All together these findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation , validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies . Accumulating evidence has shed light on the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites . Microrchidia ( MORC ) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While we were unable to confirm a direct role of PfMORC in the sexual conversion due to a nonsense mutation in AP2-G gene in our transfected lines , its strong interaction with AP2-G during the asexual cell cycle indicates that PfMORC in combination with other epigenetic factors may most likely control AP2-G expression and sexual differentiation . We now have powerful evidence demonstrating that PfMORC is not only critical for parasite cell cycle progression and its survival but also has a direct role in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing , including regulating immune evasion through antigenic variation . All together our work-demonstrated that in addition to its direct role in heterochromatin formation and antigenic variation , PfMORC may act as a potential repressor to control a set of parasite-specific genes including genes involved in parasite egress and invasion , and antigenic variation between the trophozoite to schizont stage transition . Using IFA and protein pull-downs , we have confirmed that PfMORC localizes to the nucleus and interacts with multiple ApiAP2 TFs , chromatin remodelers , and epigenetic players associated with heterochromatin regions including H3K9me3 , SIP2 , HDAC1 , and the ISWI chromatin-remodeling complex ( SWIB/MDM2 ) . Although some discrepancies have been observed with other studies , mainly due to the fact that MORC protein was not used as the bait protein , our study validated the interaction of MORC with these partners , supporting that PfMORC is in complex with key heterochromatin regulators . It is also important to recognize that the many pathways affected at the transcriptional level throughout the asexual stages in ( - ) aTC PfMORC lines are not only the direct results of PfMORC downregulation and decrease of its targeted DNA binding site . Although additional experiments will be required , our hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that downregulation of the PfMORC significantly reduced H3K9me3 coverage in the heterochromatin cluster ( s ) and 5 ' flanking regions of var and rifin genes . As our data confirm the importance of PfMORC and the parasite specificity of several interacting partners , it is tempting to speculate that drugs targeting these protein complexes could lead to novel antiparasitic strategies . They are most likely a combination of direct and indirect effects of PfMORC KD warranted by the cell cycle arrest observed at the phenotypic level and the collapse of the chromatin organization confirmed using the chromatin conformation capture experiment . Despite intensive investigations on the dynamic nature of the Plasmodium chromatin , progress has been slow in capturing the regulatory factors that maintain and control chromatin structure and gene expression throughout parasite development . We can speculate that lack of MORC impacts heterochromatin and chromatin compaction , preventing access to gene promoters from TFs and the general transcriptional machinery in a stage-specific manner . MORC proteins from plant to animal cells have a broad range of binding sites within the genome and participate in either DNA methylation establishment or heterochromatin formation . Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool , we have determined the nuclear localization , genome-wide distribution , and regulatory impacts of PfMORC on the parasite chromatin , transcriptome , and cell cycle development . Disparities observed in the essentiality of PfMORC for the parasite survival in previous studies are most likely the results of weak protein disruption highlighting the need for a significant downregulation of PfMORC for true functional analysis . Using a combination of ChIP-seq , protein knock down , RNA-seq , and Hi-C experiments , we also demonstrated that the MORC protein is essential for the tight regulation of gene expression . They have also been shown to co-localize with TFs in unmethylated promoter regions to alter chromatin accessibility and regulate TF binding and gene expression . These direct and indirect effects should be carefully considered , and a combination of functional genomic studies should be completed when interpreting changes
[METHODS] ",,902,94,None,"The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a parasite that lives in the bloodstream of humans . The parasite is able to grow and multiply in the body , but it also has a number of different stages , including the erythrocytic stage , which is the first stage of the parasite’s life cycle . This stage is known as the schizont stage . It is triggered by a mutation in a gene called Microrchidia , a protein that is found in the chromosomes of many animals . In the asexual stage of this parasite , the microrchydia bind to a region of the DNA called chromatin , where it can be used to make proteins . However , it is not clear how this protein interacts with other proteins in the genome . To investigate this , Weiss et al . used a technique called CRISPR/Cas9 to create a new version of a chromatid protein called PfMORC . Using this technique , we compared the structure of the chromatic region with that of the protein , and found that PfMoRC is involved in the formation of the heterochromatin structure . These experiments showed that PpFMORC is also involved in regulating the expression of genes involved in antigenic variation , such as the genes that are involved in parasite invasion and invasion . Further experiments revealed that the PfMHoRC protein is also important for controlling the growth and development of the human parasite in the future ."

[ABSTRACT] While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors , it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts . Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts . Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health , prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions . Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing , we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas . The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors ( decreased nest-building , increased latency to eat a cookie , and reduced wheel running ) . Unraveling the interaction between the tumor , infiltrating nerves , and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer . The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Moreover , given that carprofen and buprenorphine decrease inflammation , their ability to restore normal nesting and cookie test behaviors ( which require the use of the oral cavity where the tumor is located ) suggests that inflammation at the tumor site contributed to the decline in these behaviors in vehicle-treated animals . These data show that the constraint imposed by the tumor on behavioral activities that require the use of the oral cavity is mainly due to pain and not to the physical interference of the tumor mass with the pattern of oral activities that need to take place for mice to perform the corresponding behavior . This revelation paves the way for in-depth exploration into the mechanistic underpinnings of cancer-associated alterations in well-being and mental health , shedding light on potential therapeutic interventions to alleviate these profound effects . While smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol are risk factors for HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma , even males that do not smoke and drink are have a higher susceptibility for this cancer than females . We have previously demonstrated that head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with innervation by sensory neurons and that substance P , one of the principal neuropeptides these fibers release , drives malignant cell proliferation and migration . Our studies have also solely involved male mice , presenting a clear gap in understanding the potential sex differences in the development of the tumor-to-brain communication pathway and its subsequent influence on behavior . The human experience with cancer is distinct from that of mouse models ; individuals can live with malignant growths for extended periods , often unaware of their existence due to asymptomatic or nonspecific symptoms . However , this approach fails to label all tumor-infiltrating nerves , predominantly those not close to the WGA-injected region and nerves that are in contact with or influenced by the tumor but are not directly infiltrating it . Although analgesic drugs can partially mitigate this deficit , they fail to restore this behavior fully , despite their efficacy in completely restoring oral activity behaviors like nesting and the cookie test . Since both drugs were given systemically and each only partially restored wheel running , it suggests that systemic inflammation alone can not fully account for the decline in wheel running seen in vehicle-treated animals . Here , we found that nociceptor neurons infiltrating HNSCC connect to a pre-existing brain-projecting circuit that includes the trigeminal ganglia , the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal ( SpVc ) , as well as the parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ) , and central amygdala ( CeA ) . Our current findings indicating that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to a circuit that includes regions within the brain suggest that neuro-immune interactions within the peripheral malignancy may contribute to the behavioral alterations we studied . While the elimination of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons reduces tumor growth and enhances survival rates , it also highlights a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients . The remaining presence of these non-peptidergic , largely MrgD+ , neurons might explain why nesting behavior in TRPV1-Cre : :Floxed-DTA tumor-bearing animals is only partially restored . Although we can confidently assert that all labeled neurons are indeed tumor-infiltrating or connected , we can not conclusively state that all tracer-negative ipsilateral nerves are unconnected to the tumor-brain circuit . Neuro-immune communications in the context of cancer and behavior have also been studied ( e. g. sickness behavior , depression ) however , these studies did not assess these interactions at the tumor bed . Second , our nerve tracing methodology , where we injected 2 µl of WGA into the tumor bed , is designed to label only the tumor-infiltrating nerves and their connections . Neuro-immune interactions have been studied in the context of a variety of conditions including , but not limited to infection , inflammation , homeostasis in the gut , as well as neurological diseases .

[METHODS] ",,881,93,None,"Head and neck cancer is the most common form of cancer in the world . It is caused by a tumor that is growing in the skin , causing it to grow and spread . The tumor can also affect the ability of the brain to detect and respond to changes in the body’s temperature . In addition , it can cause the body to become more prone to cancer , which can lead to depression , anxiety , and even death . One way that cancer can affect the body is to treat it with drugs . These drugs can be used to treat a variety of diseases , including cancer . However , they can also be used as a drug to treat other diseases . For example , some people with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are more likely to develop a condition called a mental health disorder . This means that if the tumor is not treated , the brain will be more susceptible to the disease . To find out how the brain interacts with the tumor , Wang et al . used a mouse model to study how nerves infiltrating tumors interact with the brain . Using a technique called neuronal tracing , this technique revealed that the tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to different brain areas . While the mice were given analgesics , their behavior remained the same . When the tumor was removed , these mice were able to eat a cookie without having to go to the mouth , while the mice did not eat the cookie . Furthermore , when the mice had been given a placebo , nociceptor neurons infiltrated the brain with a protein called TRPV1 .

[ABSTRACT] In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants , we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability , secondary structure , protein oligomeric state , particle formation , and liquid-liquid phase separation . In the Omicron variant , distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties , and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation . We find variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) sufficient to allow local plasticity , but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses . Taking advantage of the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2 , we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein . A picture emerges where genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species , in particular in the IDRs . Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] It is interesting to note that the R203K/G204R mutation , the P13L mutation , and the P13L/Δ31-33 combination each can occur independently of each other in viable virus species , with 261 genomes in the database carrying only the P13L mutation , 9548 only the combination P13L/Δ31-33 , and > 50 , 000 genomes exclusively the double mutation R203K/G204R , even though their more frequent coexistence ( by approximately 10-fold , in all of Omicron variants ) might suggest epistatic interactions and a fitness advantage . Besides traditional sequence-based structure prediction and structure/function relationships , and more recent recognition of structural dynamics , new paradigms have emerged with increased understanding of the role of IDRs , their mimicry of SLiMs , nonlocal physicochemical properties of sequence regions , and the ability of IDRs to promote macroscopic phase separation to generate or usurp condensates with virus-related functions . It may seem as a paradox that despite this conservation these features seem not very fine-tuned and that significant variation of these properties is still observed within the viable mutant spectrum , for polarity and hydrophobicity significantly exceeding the spread of parameter values of the folded domains . This is reflected in the altered secondary structure observed in CD of Nδ and N : G215C , as well as their oligomers observed in SV-AUC , and this would explain the impact of the G215C mutation on the thermal stability reported by intrinsic fluorescence localized to the NTD and CTD . These distinctions are likely functionally important , with the polarity and charges of the SR-rich linker region aiding in NA binding , the hydrophobicity of the L-rich region aiding in assembly functions , and the acidic N3 region probably playing a role in NA- and M-protein interactions as suggested from analogy to MHV- and SARS-CoV-1 . This is consistent with the partial 'rescue ' of particle formation and full restoration of LLPS propensity that we have observed in the No molecule with the complete set of P13L/Δ31-33/R203K/G204R mutations defining N-protein from the BA . This brings into stark relief our limited understanding of the genotype/phenotype relationship , which is very detailed on some local functional aspects , such as spike protein antigenicity , but not much developed in general . Correspondingly , in a recent study of SLiMs variation across the mutant spectrum , we found the total number and detailed location of phosphorylation SLiMs to vary considerably in the SR-rich region , but to be maintained overall at a high level across this region . The tolerance for the remaining comparatively smaller fluctuations in physicochemical parameters may be important to allow sufficient local variation in sequence space for additional functions to evolve , such as the emergence of SLiMs to manipulate the host/virus interface . In different VLP and cellular assays , it has been shown to modulate N-protein phosphorylation and thereby the balance between replication and assembly , with contributions from an emerging alternate , truncated N-protein ( 210-419 ) that itself supports assembly . From the ensemble of observed consensus sequences of infected hosts , we can extract , for the first time , an exhaustive map of possible amino acid replacements in viral proteins that are tolerable for viable virus . These results must be considered in the context of the highly dynamic nature of N-protein , which is caused by the flexibility of intrinsically disordered domains , the NTD and its disordered β-hairpin , and the large-scale conformational fluctuations of the N-protein dimer in solution . Focusing on SARS-CoV-2 N-protein we have studied the diversity of biophysical phenotypes with the goal to increase understanding of salient mechanisms of the many N-protein functions , and also to glean aspects of the biophysical fitness landscape underlying evolution . First , mutations can impact the transient helix in the hydrophobic L-rich region of the linker , and , as we have shown previously , promote its helical conformation and

The virus has a unique ability to bind to the nucleocapsid protein , which is found in many viruses , but it is not clear how this is achieved . To understand how the virus works , researchers need to understand the structure and function of the virus . This is because the virus can be made up of many different amino acids , such as amino acids that are found in a single amino acid . However , there are many different types of amino acids in the virus that can be used to make the protein . In particular , the amino acid sequences of these amino acids can change the shape of the protein and the stability of its structure . For example , a protein called N-protein can change its shape if it is mutated . Similarly , an amino acid called P13L can change how the protein is assembled . These changes can also affect how the proteins interact with each other . It is not known how these changes affect the structure or function of these proteins . Now , Wang et al . have used a technique called biophysical analysis to study the effects of mutations on the structure of a virus , using a large database of RNA viruses .

[ABSTRACT] Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation , whilst in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus , changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor unexpectedly led to higher levels in energy expenditure of type II , fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures ( 20 °C ) . Upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8 °C ( near the body temperature of torpid animals ) , we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77-107 % during torpor compared to active periods . As the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood , our study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization . Additionally , we observe that it is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potentially contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis . This may act as a potential molecular mechanism mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure . Altogether , we demonstrate that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals , contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle . Hibernation is a period of metabolic suppression utilized by many small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods . We then conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand . Additionally , we observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemilineatus , which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule . We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators , Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus and larger hibernators , Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus . In parallel , we performed multiple proteomics analyses .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our findings demonstrate that in small hibernators such as I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus , the ATP turnover time of relaxed myosin molecules ( in both DRX and SRX conformations ) is faster during torpor ( and IBA ) , especially in type II muscle fibers , leading to an unexpected overall increased ATP consumption . A study from Aydin et al. , 2008 , demonstrated in mice that when a shivering muscle , soleus , was prevented from undergoing non-shivering thermogenesis via knock-out of UCP1 and were subsequently exposed to cold temperatures , the force production of these muscles was significantly reduced due to prolonged shivering . It would furthermore ideally be possible to increase the biological sample size of all the species analysed in this study to further confirm the results which we report , particularly as modest differences are seen in the resting myosin conformation values of U. americanus . Further research into changes to myosin head conformation in human atrophy and immobilization models would provide an interesting comparison to these data and potentially highlight resting myosin conformation as a novel target in the treatment of sarcopenia associated with aging and/or inactivity . This is of particular interest when compared to a previous study by Toepfer et al. , who observed that in cardiac muscle from I. tridecemlineatus the percentage of myosin heads in the DRX conformation was lower in periods of torpor vs SA and IBA . Taken together , we believe that the aberrant PTMs and/or protein expression remodeling do play a role in modifying the myosin filament stability and this all may be triggered by the well-known decreased tension on sarcomeres during hibernation . Metabolic organs such as skeletal muscle are well-known to increase core body temperature in response to significant cold exposure ( i ) by inducing rapid involuntary contractions known as shivering or ( ii ) a process named non-shivering thermogenesis ( NST ) . Therefore , the inhibition of excess heat production via myosin ATP hydrolysis is likely a protective mechanism which has evolved to facilitate reductions in core body temperature and wider metabolic shutdown during torpor . Our results of higher ATP consumption during torpor ( and IBA ) could , at first glance , be seen as counter-intuitive but is an indication of adaptation to the myosin protein during hibernating periods . As the biopsies which were used in this study were all obtained from the hind leg of the animals studied , it is important to consider that the myosin dynamics may differ if these biopsies were sampled from different areas in the body . In contrast to our study hypothesis , we demonstrated that the animals studied continue to maintain their active levels of myosin in the more metabolically active disordered-relaxed state ( DRX ) during periods of metabolic shutdown . Interestingly , lowering the temperature decreased DRX and SRX-linked ATP turnover times during active periods ( in SA and IBA ) , especially in type II myofibers from I. tridecemlineatus , inducing an increase in ATP consumption . Accordingly , a few studies investigating human pathological conditions have reported disruptions of the myosin ATP turnover times in resting isolated skeletal myofibers , but their actual impacts have never been thoroughly investigated . This is of relevance to the data from our study as HSPs have been demonstrated to be able to bind sarcomeric proteins and regulate their turnover , including that of myosin itself . This is consistent with our X-ray diffraction experiments where M6 spacing was found to be greater during torpor and is indicative of a unique structural configuration of the thick filament
[METHODS] ",,944,96,None,"Many animals , including humans , are unable to survive during the winter months . This is because the muscles in their bodies are not able to produce enough energy to keep them warm . The muscles that make up the body’s muscles are made up of proteins called myosin , which is a protein that helps the body to store energy . Myosine is also found in many other animals . It is thought that the muscle cells in these animals have a similar structure to that of a human muscle , but it is not clear how this changes . To investigate this , Aydin et al . used a technique called X-ray diffraction to study the structure of myoSin in a group of animals that are able or unwilling to shiver . Using the technique , the researchers found that a small group of small mammal species , Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus , were more likely to be swarming during the cold winter months than in the active period . However , when the animals were exposed to cold temperatures , their muscle fibers were less swarmed , and their energy consumption increased by 77% compared to the normal range . These findings suggest that the sluggish activity of the muscles during the warm winter months may be linked to a decrease in the amount of energy they use . In addition , it may also be possible to alter the shape of the muscle fiber in response to the cold . Aiming to find out more about how the muscles of these animals respond to the effects of cold temperatures could help to develop new treatments for sarcopenia , a condition caused by aging and/or inactivity ."

[ABSTRACT] Overall , our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns , a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth . Surprisingly , analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation , implying incomplete rotation of the division plane . In this work , we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis . Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns , composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks , and small , disorganized clusters located in the outer edges . Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane , resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction . Broadly , this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development . Finally , correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion , whereas columns support elongation . Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated , they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction . Chondrocyte columns , which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture , play a central role in bone elongation .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] One limitation of our rotation analysis is that in order to calculate the relative position between neighboring cells , we assumed that chondrocyte rotation and orientation are correlated and that chondrocytes do not move after rotating , as was previously suggested . One plausible explanation is that earlier studies focused on the mechanism of division plane rotation in column formation , but they either analyzed small subsets of clonal doublets without tracking their contributions to columns or examined non-clonal doublets . In line with this idea , disruption of cell polarity , which leads to more incomplete division plane rotations , causes bone widening , whereas recent simulation of the growth plate predicted that lack of rotation during cell division causes the bone to expand in width . Our 3D analyses reveal the temporal dynamics of division plane rotations and their effect on the formation of columns and clusters in the pre- and postnatal growth plate , as well as the correlation of these morphogenetic processes with different growth behaviors . Without integrating these aspects into a comprehensive study , it is difficult to confirm the existence of clonal columns and determine whether they are formed by cells that have undergone complete division plane rotation . Our discovery that during embryogenesis , when bone elongation is at its highest , the growth plates contain only few columns , contradicts previous studies and reveals the need to reconsider the underlying mechanisms . Moreover , the underlying mechanisms of column formation and the function of bone elongation may be regulated by this organization of clusters into geometric non-clonal columns , or increase in cell volume . Our current analysis of these different morphologies suggests that columns contribute to bone elongation , as previously thought , whereas clusters may provide a mechanism to control local morphology of the growing bones . While the mechanisms that regulates the rotation of the division plane during bone growth are not fully understood , previous work provides several indications for both mechanical and molecular signals . Additionally , clones in articular cartilage were shown to form by non-stereotypic cell stacking , similar to the clusters we observed , raising the question of the function they may serve . If indeed these cellular modalities are utilized to promote different growth strategies , then the mechanism that controls the division plane can be central in the regulation of bone morphology . These morphological entities correlate with the temporal dynamics of growth plate elongation and expansion , suggesting that clusters and columns support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development ( Figure 7 ) . Instead , most clones form elongated clusters that orient orthogonal to the longitudinal bone axis as a result of numerous incomplete rotations that occur during cell division within a clone . Changes in chondrocyte morphology , proliferation , and matrix secretion may also play important roles in this process ; however , their exact contributions to embryonic bone elongation are unclear . Elongated clusters that orient orthogonal to the longitudinal axis due to incomplete rotations during cell divisions might be the cellular strategy that enables growth plate expansion in the embryo . In this work , we studied column formation by analyzing the 3D structure of cell clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plates of mice , using a modified version of 3D MAPs . Here , we discovered that the core mechanism underlying chondrocyte column formation , namely a complete rotation of the division plane during chondrocyte proliferation , is rare in the embryonic growth plate . Our finding that embryonic bones extensively expand as they elongate supports the existence of a multifunctional design mechanism that allows coping with these different growth requirements . This concept addresses the need to reduce the size and

This layer is called a growth plate . When a cell divides it is called the division plane . It is a process called elongation , where the cells move to form a stack of cells that are oriented perpendicular to the growth direction . During this process , the cells rotate their division planes to form columns , or columns . These columns are formed by the cells forming a row of cells in the middle of the growth plate that is oriented parallel to the direction of growth . However , it is not clear how these columns form . To investigate this question , Xiao et al . used a technique called 3D imaging to study hundreds of clonal cells in growth plates of mice . In the experiments , they found that the growth plates contain only a few columns – a characteristic of the division plan . Instead , most cells were arranged as if they were stacked . Although this was the first time that a single cell was arranged at the same time as another cell , this was not the case . Furthermore , when a pair of cells were placed in the same direction as the other , many of the cells did not appear to be stacked in the opposite direction , suggesting that the cells were not stacked correctly .

By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate , we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access . Nevertheless , these studies leave open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling , while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations . Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters ( POTs ) are of great pharmaceutical interest owing to their promiscuous substrate binding site that has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs . These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs , which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays . Cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have recently provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs , SLC15A1 , and SLC15A2 . Here , we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces . Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Taking together our 2D-PMFs and ABFE simulations , it is also clear that E622 , in addition to being essential for peptide recognition , plays two further roles : its protonation both facilitates substrate release and makes an additive contribution to the IF-directed bias exerted by the intracellular gate triggers ( whether E622 forms 'part ' of the intracellular gate remains then as a merely linguistic question ) . It would , therefore , not be meaningful to interpret the shape of a single PMF in this way ; only responses of the PMF to protonation-state or substrate-binding changes should be used to inform our view of the conformational cycle , since these are likely to benefit from error cancellation with respect to factors that act on the overall protein conformations ( which are conserved between the different conditions in which the PMFs were sampled ) . ] However , if the OCC→OF transition is kinetically accessible on experimental timescales without prior protonation events ( beyond what our MD was able to sample ) , it would also be consistent with our data that OCC→OF is spontaneous in standard protonation states , and H87 and ( possibly ) D342 are merely the initial sites of protonation once OF is reached , providing further stabilisation . There is evidence in our simulations that an additional protonation site-aside from H87 , D342 , E53 , E56 , and E622-may be involved in the mechanism , since E622 protonation , while biasing the transporter towards IF , also increases the OCC→IF transition barrier if Ala-Phe substrate is bound ( we therefore indicate the proton movements at these stages with a question mark in Figure 8 ) . While the cell-based assay used here can not differentiate for example between proton-coupling and non-proton-coupling residues , our results still provide a useful first step towards the validation of the gating mechanisms we propose with our PMFs , and should prove informative for the future design of more in-depth experiments . This information will prove useful for the project of employing peptide transporters as vehicles for drug delivery-especially since what determines the eﬃcacy of a transporter substrate is not only related to aﬃnity but crucially also to an ability of the substrate to move through the steps of the alternating access cycle once bound to the transporter . Our data is not fully determinate with respect to whether protons move to E56 before or after the OF→OCC conformational transition ( our CpHMD , for example , remains agnostic on this matter since the shift in the E56 pKa value induced by the substrate is evident in both the OCC and OF states ) . Integrating the results from extensive sampling across several MD methods , covering all stages of the PepT2 alternating access cycle , we are now in a position to propose a detailed molecular mechanism of the complete transport cycle , including accounts both of proton coupling to conformational changes and of substrate-proton coupling ( Figure 8 ) . Once the substrate ( driven by E622 protonation ) and the protons ( driven by their electrochemical potential gradient ) have left through the open intracellular gate into the intracellular bulk , the resulting apo , standard-protonation-state IF conformation has a thermodynamic preference to return to OCC as evidenced in our 2D-PMFs . Given that H87 and D342 are accessible from the acidic extracellular bulk , and in light of the transition-region stabilisation from the H87 ( protonated ) -D317 interaction we have identified , our simulations suggest an interpretation where protonation happens in the OCC state , driving the OCC→OF transition by stabilising the OF state over OCC . We have treated this step alchemically in our ABFE simulations
[METHODS] ",,925,95,None,"Proteins , such as oligopeptides and peptide transporters , are a group of proteins that carry out a number of important functions , including transporting a molecule of a drug to the target tissue . These proteins are known as proton-coupled transporters ( POTs ) , and they have been linked to the development of new drugs . However , it is not clear how these proteins work , or how they interact with each other . For example , a protein called SLC15A1 has a binding site on the surface of its protein , which is known as the extracellular gate . This is where the molecule binds to the substrate , but it does not interact with the protein . The molecule then moves towards the target , where it is able to be re-expressed . In this way , the protein can be used as a transporter to deliver the drug to a target tissue or organ . But how does this work ? The first step in understanding the mechanism of POT-mediated transport is to study the structure of the proteins . To do this , researchers need to know how the proteins interact with their substrates . A technique called molecular dynamics ( MD ) is used to measure the temperature of the protein and to predict how it will react to the environment . Using a technique called constant-PH MD , scientists can simulate how the molecules interact . They can then use this information to design new drugs that can be taken from the body . Now , Wang et al . have developed a new method that allows them to study how a POT interacts with its substrate . By using a combination of MD and a mathematical model , they have mapped out how the POT behaves"

[ABSTRACT] Further , we found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback , posterior STG was selectively activated if participants were engaged in a DAF paradigm , suggesting that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity . Importantly , there was a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity , suggesting suppression might be a key mechanism that underlies speech monitoring . This hypothesis has been previously confirmed in non-human primates , however a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring remains elusive . Next , we performed a delayed auditory feedback ( DAF ) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations . To address this issue , we obtained intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production . Across the animal kingdom , neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization , and humans are no exception . We first characterized the detailed topography of auditory suppression , which varied across superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) . A common hypothesis is that suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback , enabling the detection of vocalization errors . Indeed , overlapping sites showed enhanced responses to feedback , indicating sensitivity .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While remaining cautious about this interpretation and our study 's limitation in attentional controls , we believe that this response enhancement represents an increased neural gain driven by attention to auditory feedback , and highlights the critical role of the posterior STG in auditory-motor integration during speech monitoring , with its close proximity to the human ventral attention network comprising temporoparietal junction . In our study , we found that neural responses in the posterior STG were larger for DAF0 ( randomly presented simultaneous feedback condition in the DAF task ) as compared with the VWR-AF condition ( consistent simultaneous feedback throughout standard word reading task ) , even though participants displayed similar vocal behavior in these two conditions . More recent EEG studies demonstrated that dividing attention between auditory feedback and additional visual stimuli or increasing the attentional load of the task affected vocal responses as well as the magnitude of ERP components , suggesting that attention modulates auditory feedback control on both a behavioral and a cortical level . Replaying a recording of the participants ' own delayed voice back to them , which we were unable to complete in this study , would have made the results of the two studies more comparable while also completely eliminating the possibility of a sensory explanation for the observed response enhancement . In contrast , to replicate this finding in humans , a previous iEEG study by Chang et al. , 2013 , used frequency-shifted feedback during vowel production and found that most suppressed auditory sites did not overlap with those sensitive to feedback alterations . Auditory sites that lie posterior to the lateral termination of the TTS in the STG showed stronger activation during the DAF task compared to a standard word reading task , even for trials in which participants received simultaneous feedback , demonstrating attentional modulation of feedback sensitivity . So far , a clear gradient for speech-induced suppression has never been reported in the STG but only in the Heschl 's gyrus and superior temporal sulcus by studies that used comprehensive depth electrode coverage within the temporal lobe . Auditory feedback control of speech was thought to be involuntary and not subject to attentional control , because several previous studies showed that participants produced compensatory responses to pitch shifts even when they were told to ignore feedback perturbations . Using DAF instead of frequency-shifted feedback , we demonstrated a significant overlap of two neural populations in the STG , along with a strong correlation between the degree of speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback . Our results suggested that attention to one 's own speech stream during adverse speaking conditions , such as during an auditory feedback perturbations task , might also contribute to the response enhancement in the auditory cortex . Our broad topographical search using subdural electrodes revealed additional sites outside the canonical auditory regions in the STG that showed speech-induced suppression , mainly in the MTG , and a few others in the SMG and preCG . Sensorimotor regions in the preCG including inferior frontal and premotor cortices are known to activate during passive listening tasks , and show tuning to different acoustic properties of speech similar to the auditory regions in the STG . Neurosurgical recordings and neuroimaging studies that investigate the brain mechanism of auditory feedback processing demonstrated that these feedback-induced vocal adjustments are accompanied by enhanced neural responses in various auditory regions . Similarly , when fundamental frequency ( pitch ) or formant frequencies of the voice are shifted , speakers change their vocal output in the opposite direction of the shift to compensate for the spectral perturbation . Only in a non-human primate study , which recorded single-unit activity in auditory neurons of marmoset monkeys , it was shown that neurons that were suppressed during vocalization exhibited increased activity during frequency-shifted feedback . Based on single-unit recordings in non-human primates ,
[METHODS] ",,894,93,None,"The brain is made up of a group of neurons called the auditory cortex . These neurons control how the brain responds to changes in speech , and they are also responsible for detecting errors in the pronunciation of words . The brain also has a number of different regions that are involved in the processing of speech . One of these regions is called the superior temporal gyrus , which is located in the brain’s posterior region . This region is known to be the most important part of the brain . However , it is not clear how this region is affected . In humans , the brain is able to detect a variety of changes in the pitch of the voice , such as a change in a pitch , or a shift in the tone of the mouth . To investigate this , Wang et al . used a technique called intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) to measure the activity of the auditoric cortex during speech production . Using this technique , they found that the brains of 35 neurosurgery patients were more sensitive to the changes in pitch than those of non-human primates . When the participants were given a speech task , their brains responded more strongly to the feedback , indicating that they were more prone to making mistakes in their speech if they were given simultaneous feedback . Furthermore , when they were asked to produce speech with simultaneous feedback on the same speech task that they had been given , some of the areas of the cortex that were suppressed were more likely to be sensitive to feedback compared to the rest of the neurons .

[ABSTRACT] We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs , together with the ancillary restriction factors , employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems , in which an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first , but then , if it fails , an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over . All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components , such as OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein that binds bacterial transfer-messenger RNA ( tmRNA ) , YTH-like domains that might recognize methylated tmRNA , tRNA , or rRNA , and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs , along with RNases , such as HEPN domains , all suggesting that the CoCoNuTs target RNA . A comprehensive census of McrBC systems , among the most common forms of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems , followed by phylogenetic analysis , reveals their enormous abundance in diverse prokaryotes and a plethora of genomic associations . In many of these superoperons , CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides , possibly , RNA fragments with cyclic termini , that bind associated CARF ( CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold ) domains . We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch , which we denote coiled-coil nuclease tandems ( CoCoNuTs ) for their salient features : the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases . Additional restriction systems , such as Type I RM , BREX , and Druantia Type III , are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons . The CoCoNuTs alone show extraordinary variety , with three distinct types and multiple subtypes . Many CoCoNuTs might additionally target DNA , via McrC nuclease homologs .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[DISCUSSION] One of the two outcomes can result from this cascade : infection is either eradicated quickly by restriction of the virus DNA , which inhibits cOA signaling via the depletion of viral RNA , along with the activity of RING nucleases , thus averting PCD , or else , the continued presence of viral RNA stimulates cOA signaling until PCD or dormancy occurs , limiting the spread of viruses to neighboring cells in the bacterial population . Under this scenario , the virus is either destroyed by the activity of the DNA restriction systems , which would inhibit signal production ( likely RNA fragments with cyclic phosphate ends rather than cOA ) and drive down CoCoNuT transcription , thereby preventing PCD , or as the virus replicates , signaling and CoCoNuT transcription would continue until the infection is aborted by PCD or dormancy caused by the degradation of host mRNA by the HEPN RNase ( s ) of the CoCoNuT . We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs , in conjunction with ancillary restriction factors , implement an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems , whereby an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first , but then , if it fails , an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over . In the subsequent phase of analysis , GTPase domain sequences were extracted from the McrB homolog pool , and DUF2357 and PD- ( D/E ) xK nuclease domain sequences were extracted from the McrC homolog pool , leaving as a remainder the fused specificity domains that we intended to classify ( although the McrC homologs are not the primary bearers of specificity modules in McrBC systems , they can be fused to various additional domains , including those of the EVE superfamily ) ( Figure 2 , Figure 2-figure supplement 1 ) . Our observations of the contextual associations , both of the CoCoNuTs and their relatives , showed that helicases of this large family are typically encoded in operons with downstream genes coding for an elongated wHTH domain fused at its C-terminus to a variety of effectors , generally , nucleases , which we denote CnuE ( Figures 3 and 6 , Figure 6-figure supplement 1 ) . A notable difference between the generally similar , dual DNA and RNA-targeting mechanism of many Type III CRISPR-Cas systems and the proposed mechanism of the CoCoNuTs is that viral RNA recognition by the Cas10-Csm complex , rather than binding of a second messenger to a CARF domain , activates both DNA cleavage activity by the HD domain and production of cOA that triggers non-specific RNA cleavage . Intriguingly , as described above , in order to rescue stalled ribosomes , tmRNA must bind to SmpB , an OB-fold protein highly similar to the predicted structures of the SPB domains fused at the N-termini of the CnuH helicases in Type II and III-A CoCoNuTs , which are the only types that frequently associate with RtcR homologs . By contrast , Type III-A CnuC/McrC homologs entirely lost the beta-sandwich domain , PD- ( D/E ) xK nuclease , and zinc ribbon found in Type I-A and Type II , but gained an Hsp70-like NBD/SBD unit similar to those fused to the McrB-like GTPase domain in early branching members of the NxD clade . As translation in bacteria is co-transcriptional , the products of genes transcribed first would accumulate before those of the genes transcribed last , so that the full , potentially suicidal impact of the CoCoNuT predicted RNA nucleolytic engine would only be felt after the associated DNA restriction systems had ample time to act - and possibly ,

[ABSTRACT] Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity , we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ) in C. elegans . Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP , resulting in intestinal bloating , rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria , and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection . Finally , we show that the nuclear hormone receptor , NHR-8 , is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan . We demonstrate that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction , resulting in enhanced lifespan . Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the C. elegans DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension . Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through multiple signaling pathways . Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions . The TFEB ortholog , HLH-30 , is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Several C. elegans mutants with defects in the DMP and bloated intestinal lumens are known to have dampened nutrient absorption , leading to reduced lipid deposition in the gut , mimicking calorie restriction . It remains to be studied whether NHR-8 and HLH-30 work in the same or different pathways downstream of calcineurin inhibition ( Figure 6C ) . We found that tax-6 knockdown enhanced lifespan independent of multiple dietary restriction pathways , including raga-1 , rsks-1 , daf-16 , and nhr-49 . The complete characterization of the physiological changes downstream of gut bloating may provide broad insights into the effects of gut physiology on behaviors , immunity , and lifespan . Recent studies in different organisms have shown that gut bloating has profound effects on food-seeking behaviors , immunity , and lifespan . Therefore , it is likely that reduced lipid levels because of intestinal bloating result in the activation of autophagy upon calcineurin inhibition . We identified that tax-6 knockdown resulted in the upregulation of nhr-8 mRNA levels , and nhr-8 was required for the increased lifespan in tax-6 knockdown animals . It is possible that some of the effects of intestinal bloating on the host physiology are mediated by calorie restriction . We showed that defects in the DMP caused by calcineurin inhibition reduce lipid levels and mimic calorie restriction . The calcium waves are regulated by the endoplasmic reticulum calcium channel , ITR-1 , and mutations in the itr-1 gene affect defecation by preventing cytoplasmic calcium release . Indeed , the neuropeptide Y receptors , which control a diverse set of behaviors , including appetite , are activated by gut bloating . It is interesting to note that tax-6 gain-of-function mutants are also known to have DMP defects . Because autophagy may regulate lifespan via multiple longevity pathways , this could explain why calcineurin inhibition enhances lifespan via multiple mechanisms . Increased amounts of calcium ions activate the phosphatase activity of calcineurin via the binding of the calcium-sensing protein calmodulin to calcineurin . We observed that HLH-30 is also required for the increase in lifespan upon calcineurin inhibition . NHR-8 has been shown to mediate calorie restriction-dependent lifespan via the regulation of xenobiotic responses . Activation of autophagy has been shown to be one of the mechanisms of extended lifespan upon calcineurin inhibition . Importantly , the TFEB ortholog , HLH-30 , is required for lipolysis and autophagy under starvation conditions . HLH-30 is also required for lifespan enhancement via autophagy and multiple longevity pathways . Indeed , calcineurin is expressed in the enteric muscles that are required for contractions for DMP . The rhythmic DMP cycle in C. elegans is known to be regulated by rhythmic calcium waves . Multiple longevity pathways have been identified under different paradigms of dietary restriction . Calorie restriction is known to induce autophagy , and autophagy is required for calorie restriction-mediated lifespan extension . Calcineurin inhibition has been shown to extend C. elegans lifespan via multiple mechanisms . An earlier study identified that tax-6 knockdown enhanced lifespan via NHR-49 . Calorie restriction is known to induce neuropeptide Y , which might trigger feeding behaviors . Therefore , optimum calcineurin activity appears to be crucial for maintaining a rhythmic DMP . It is likely that calcium waves regulate DMP via calcineurin activities . We currently do not understand the reasons for this discrepancy . Dietary restriction-mediated lifespan extensions are complex and context-dependent . We discovered that calcineurin is required for the C. elegans DMP . Calcineurin activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels .

[ABSTRACT] Both human performance and fMRI activity patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex support that different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity , thus suggesting cognitive space as a principle for representing conflicts . Based on the cognitive space theory , different conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a ( low-dimensional ) cognitive space , which can then be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes working along the dimensions . As conflicts can arise from different sources ( e. g. , sensory input , internal representations ) , how a limited set of cognitive control processes can effectively address diverse conflicts remains a major challenge . It leads to a hypothesis that conflicts similar in their sources are also represented similarly in the cognitive space . Cognitive control resolves conflicts between task-relevant and -irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior . We designed a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This finding suggests that different cognitive control states may be encoded in an abstract cognitive space , which reconciles the long-standing debate between the domain-general and domain-specific views of cognitive control and provides a parsimonious and more broadly applicable framework for understanding how our brains efficiently and flexibly represents multiple task settings . A possible improvement to our current design would be to include left , right , up , and down arrows represented in a grid formation across four spatially separate quadrants , with each arrow mapped to its own response button . However , since this paradigm is a two-alternative forced choice design , the behavioral CSE is not a pure measure of adjusted control but could be partly confounded by bottom-up factors such as feature integration . However , this appears unlikely as it would imply that our manipulation of conflict types merely represented varying levels of a single conflict , akin to manipulating task difficulty when everything else being equal . Furthermore , Fu et al. , 2022 have shown that the representation of mixtures of Simon and Flanker conflicts was compositional , rather than reflecting single dimension , which also applies to our cases . If task difficulty were the primary variable , we would expect to see greater representational similarity between task conditions of similar difficulty , such as the Stroop and Simon conditions , which demonstrates comparable congruency effects ( see Figure 2-figure supplement 1 ) . The use of an experimental paradigm that permits parametric manipulation of conflict similarity provides a way to systematically investigate the organization of cognitive control , as well as its influence on adaptive behaviors . This gap highlights a broader challenge within cognitive science : effectively manipulating and measuring similarity levels for conflicts , as well as other high-level cognitive processes , which are inherently abstract . Additionally , our study is not a comprehensive test of the cognitive space hypothesis but aimed primarily to provide original evidence for the geometry of cognitive space in representing conflict information in cognitive control . Previous studies with mixed conflicts have applied mainly categorical manipulations of conflict types , such as the multi-source interference task and color Stroop-Simon task . This limitation also means we can not conclusively rule out the possibility of a real unidimensional space driven solely by spatial Stroop or Simon conflicts . Future studies may replicate our findings with a multiple-choice design ( including more varied stimulus sets , locations , and responses ) with confound-free trial sequences . We further showed cognitive control can both enhance the target representation and suppress the distractor representation ( Figure 5E ) , which is in line with previous studies . The categorical manipulations make it difficult to quantify conceptual similarity between conflict types and hence limit the ability to test whether neural representations of conflict capture conceptual similarity . Future research should examine other aspects of the cognitive space such as its dimensionality , its applicability to other conflict tasks such as Eriksen Flanker task , and its relevance to other cognitive abilities , such as cognitive flexibility and learning . In sum , we showed that the cognitive control can be parametrically encoded in the right dlPFC and guides cognitive control to adjust goal-directed behavior . To parametrically manipulate the conflict similarity levels , we adopted the spatial Stroop-Simon paradigm that enables parametrical combinations of spatial Stroop and Simon conflicts . Moreover , the cross-subject RSA provides high sensitivity to the variables of interest and the ability to separate confounding factors . Contrary to this , our findings reveal that the Stroop-only and Simon-only conditions exhibit the lowest representational similarity ( Figure 6-figure supplement 1 ) . Another limitation is that in our design , the spatial Stroop and Simon effects are highly anticorrelated . This constraint may make the five conflict types represented in a unidimensional space ( e. g. , a circle ) embedded in a 2D space . For instance , in addition to dissociating conflict type from orientation , we dissociated

[ABSTRACT] This research was conducted by the Perinatology Research Branch , Division of Obstetrics and Maternal-Fetal Medicine , Division of Intramural Research , Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , National Institutes of Health , U. S. Department of Health and Human Services ( NICHD/NIH/DHHS ) under contract HHSN275201300006C . Thus , we conducted the largest longitudinal investigation targeting vaginal immune mediators , referred to herein as the immunoproteome , in a population at high risk for sPTB . The prediction of spontaneous preterm birth ( sPTB ) remains underpowered due to its syndromic nature and the dearth of independent analyses of the vaginal host immune response . Furthermore , the vaginal immunoproteome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early sPTB , a subset of sPTB associated with extremely adverse neonatal outcomes . Such an inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants , cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation , and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides . The vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk for early ( < 34 weeks ) sPTB . Yet , the vaginal immunoproteome is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory state in pregnant women who ultimately experience sPTL and PPROM . Vaginal swabs were collected across gestation from pregnant women who ultimately underwent term birth , sPTL , or PPROM . Most cases of preterm birth occur spontaneously and result from preterm labor with intact ( spontaneous preterm labor [ sPTL ] ) or ruptured ( preterm prelabor rupture of membranes [ PPROM ] ) membranes . The vaginal immunoproteome undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations from this shift are associated with sPTB . Cytokines , chemokines , growth factors , and antimicrobial peptides in the samples were quantified via specific and sensitive immunoassays . ALT , KRT , and NGL were supported by the Wayne State University Perinatal Initiative in Maternal , Perinatal and Child Health . Throughout uncomplicated gestation , the vaginal immunoproteome harbors a cytokine network with a homeostatic profile . Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide . Predictive models were constructed from immune mediator concentrations .

[METHODS] ",,389,55,Missing discussion section|Low token utilization (389/1024),"Preterm birth is the most common birth defect in the world . It is caused by a mutation in the vaginal immune system , which can cause a variety of conditions , including a uterus , uterine lining , and a ruptured membrane . The vagina is also a source of toxins , such as bacteria , that can cause birth defects . However , it is not clear how the immune system responds to these conditions . In this study , researchers from the National Institutes of Health , the Department of Health and Human Development , were asked to identify women at high risk of spontaneous preterm birth . This was done by collecting samples from women who had been pregnant for at least 34 weeks . During this time , they were tested to see if they had any of the following symptoms . These included a blood test , an ultrasound , or a urine test . When the samples were collected , these tests revealed that the vavaginal immunoproteome was skewed towards a pro-inflammatory state . As a result , women with a vagina that is swollen or rupturing during pregnancy had a higher risk of having spontaneous birth than women without vaginas . While the results of this study are promising , there is still a long way to go to find out if the vaguale is at risk for spontaneous birth and whether it is a risk factor for premature birth , as well as if it could be used as a biomarker for early sPTB . For this reason , we need to understand the role of this immune system in predicting spontaneous birth in women ."

[ABSTRACT] Here , we describe an in silico model , which we call the 'Hernandez-Hernandez model ' , of electrical and Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes based on new experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries . We also show that in an idealized computational model of a vessel , female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca2+ channel blockers compared to male . Over the physiological range of membrane potentials , the gating of a small number of voltage-gated K+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels are predicted to drive sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and excitability .

[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The model presented here describes the necessary and sufficient ion channels , pumps , and transporters to describe the electrical activity and Ca2+ signaling of an isolated mesenteric smooth muscle cell in the absence of complex signaling pathways . Although mouse arteries do present numerous parallels with human arteries , including analogous intravascular pressure-myogenic tone relationships , resting membrane potentials , and the expression of typical ionic channels like CaV1 . Excitation-contraction coupling refers to an electrical stimulus that drives the release of calcium from the SR and results in the physical translocation of fibers that underlie muscle contraction . In doing so , we predicted that very few channels are needed to contribute to and sustain the oscillatory behavior of the membrane potential and calcium signaling . Such an approach enabled us to perform a component dissection to analyze the sex-specific differences observed in the fundamental electrophysiology of male and female myocytes . The next phase of the project includes an expansion of the model to incorporate receptor-mediated signaling pathways that are essential for blood pressure control . However , it is well known that vascular smooth muscle cells are subject to a plethora of stimuli from endothelial cells , neurotransmitters , endocrine , and paracrine signals . We expanded our computational framework to include a 1D tissue representation , providing a basis for simulating the effect of drug effects within a vessel . The Hernandez-Hernandez model of the isolated mesenteric vascular myocyte was informed and validated with experimental data from male and female vascular myocytes . The model predictions suggested differences in the response of male and female myocytes to drugs and the underlying mechanisms for those differences . Nevertheless , we can imply contractile effects by tracking membrane potential and the elevation of [ Ca2+ ] i as a proxy . These predictions may constitute the first step toward better hypertensive therapy for males and females . To conclude , we developed and present the Hernandez-Hernandez model of male and female isolated mesenteric vascular myocytes . Future research should assess the direct applicability and implication of our findings in human subjects . In the present model , we did not explicitly consider the mechanical description of muscle contraction . An additional limitation of our study is the reliance on predominantly murine data .

[ABSTRACT] We tested this hypothesis by placing plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient , and by characterizing the macro-decomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping . Our findings highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands , possibly resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum , and emphasizing the need to contemplate decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes . We hypothesized that higher tolerance of macro-decomposers to aridity may counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers , leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients . Litter decomposition is expected to be positively associated with precipitation despite evidence that decomposers of varying sizes have different moisture dependencies . Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer . This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyper-arid sites . We found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size . Macro-decomposer richness , abundance , and biomass peaked in arid environments .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] We , in turn , hypothesized that the opposing climatic dependencies of macrofauna and that of microorganisms and mesofauna should lead to similar overall decomposition rates across precipitation gradients , except in hyper-arid environments in which decomposers activity is predicted to be minimal regardless of organism size . The puzzle of why plant litter decomposition in arid-lands is decoupled from annual precipitation and is faster than expected based on microbial decomposition models has bothered scientists for half a century , and was later termed the dryland decomposition conundrum . This discrepancy may reflect underestimation of faunal decomposition rates in drylands , possibly because these studies either deliberately grouped cold and dry environments together , or focused solely on precipitation without accounting for differences in temperature . We , however , hypothesized that climate dependencies of mesofauna and macrofauna should differ due to the lower sensitivity of macrofauna to high temperature and low moisture , and the ability of macro-decomposers to shuttle between the hostile environment aboveground and the climatic havens belowground . Our work highlights that in other less studied ecosystems additional processes like the role of animal decomposers may be dominant , opening the door for new exciting research that may shake our conceptualization of decomposition processes . Attempts to resolve this conundrum have focused predominantly on abiotic weathering agents , such as photodegradation and thermal degradation , alternative sources of moisture such as fog , dew , and atmospheric water vapor and soil-litter mixing . Plant communities differ substantially between our sites , suggesting that each decomposer community has experienced very different resource inputs , and may have access to alternative litter of various qualities . For instance , Hemilepistus reaumuri , an abundant isopod species in Avdat , and Anacanthotermes ubachi , a common termite species in Sayeret Shaked , consume detritus predominantly during the summer and autumn and disperse and reproduce during the winter . Consequently , we highlighted that differential climatic dependencies of different-sized decomposers rather than abiotic factors explain the discrepancy between classic decomposition models and the observed decomposition rates in drylands . The opposing climatic dependencies of micro- and macro-decomposers have led to similar or even higher annual decomposition rates in arid sites compared to those measured in more mesic sites . Our results suggest that decomposers respond differently to precipitation levels based on their size , leading to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient , except in hyper-arid sites . Furthermore , ample resource availability may increase niche space , resulting in higher macro-decomposer diversity , which in turn can facilitate decomposition through synergistic effects of functionally complementary species . This suggests that microorganisms , meso-decomposers , and macro-decomposers should be considered separately in decomposition models , and emphasizes the need to contemplate animals ' physiology and behavior when investigating zoogeochemical processes . During the summer , the observed hump-shaped relationship between macro-decomposition and precipitation tightly echoed the variation in richness , abundance , and biomass of macro-decomposers , revealing the mechanistic foundation for the cross-system variation in macro-decomposition . This realization provided a plausible resolution to the longstanding dryland decomposition conundrum , and exposed a hidden mechanism that may account for unexplained variation in plant litter decomposition across biomes . Our findings highlight the need to explore the moisture dependency of mesofauna in greater details , and to generate different predictions for how mesofauna and microorganisms may affect plant litter decomposition . Understanding the mechanisms that regulate decomposition in drylands is key for conserving and restoring fundamental ecosystem processes in these ever-growing areas , and in improving our understanding of global processes like C cycling . The richness , abundance , and biomass of macro-decomposers followed a hump-shaped relationship with precipitation , peaking in arid environments and diminishing toward hyper-arid or semiarid and Mediterranean sites . We used litter baskets of different mesh sizes that were placed along a sharp precipitation gradient during hot-dry summer and again during colder-wetter winter . In winter , macro-decomposer abundance , richness , and biomass were similar to or even
[METHODS] ",,870,92,None,"In the tropics and sub-tropics , plants and animals are subjected to a variety of environmental conditions , including climate change , rainfall , and a lack of water . This is due to the fact that plants are unable to produce enough nutrients for themselves , which can lead to disease . However , in areas where the soil is dry , this is not the case . In arid environments , the soil can be contaminated by a range of factors , such as the presence of a large amount of mud , a high amount of rain , or a combination of these factors . The microbial and macro-decomposers in the soil are able to decompose in the same way , but in a different way . For example , microbes and macrofauna are both found in the desert , while microbe-decomposing in the wet desert is found in warm , dry areas . Interestingly , it was not clear how these two processes are related . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called pitfall trapping to measure the size of the litter in seven sites along a gradient of precipitation . These experiments showed that a small number of micro- and macro decompositors responded differently to the varying levels of rainfall . Wang 's findings suggest that if a larger number of macro- and micro-recyclers were present in the area , they would be more likely to be decomposed in the environment .

[ABSTRACT] Deletion of Cyrib ( the gene encoding CYRI-B protein ) accelerates tumourigenesis , leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions , indicating a potential role as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation in early stages . Overall , we implicate CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer , providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis . CYRI-B depleted tumour cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid , a major driver of tumour spread , due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 . Hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all tumours drives RAC1 activation , conferring enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropinocytosis . Macropinocytosis is well understood as a nutrient scavenging mechanism , but little is known about its functions in trafficking of signalling receptors . We find that CYRI-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carries a dismal prognosis , with high rates of metastasis and few treatment options . However , as disease progresses , loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our previous cell biology studies highlighted a role for CYRI-B as a buffer of RAC1-mediated actin assembly in lamellipodia and macropinocytic cups , but did not address the potential role that CYRI-B could play in tumourigenesis and metastasis , given its central role as a regulator of motility . Deletion of Cyrib in the pancreas , in concert with expression of KRAS G12D and p53 R172H , led to acceleration of PanIN formation and an increase in the area of pancreas showing lesions with high phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK , two crucial downstream targets of KRAS and RAC1 that drive proliferation and expansion . Having a buffer for RAC1 activity could provide advantages for tumours , where mutations in KRAS will drive high activation of RAC1 , which might be detrimental to cell survival due to enhanced reactive oxygen species production and enhanced downstream signalling . Taken together , CYRI-B may have potential as a biomarker and driver of early cancer and play a role in the progression or conversion from precancerous to cancerous lesions , but more studies are needed . Thus , CYRI-B and N-WASP control two different aspects of a similar pathway , whereby LPAR1 is stimulated , internalised , and then either sorted into tubules for rapid recycling or targeted towards lysosomes for slow recycling or degradation . Polarity maintenance could be disrupted by a lack of proper control of Scar/WAVE complex localisation leading to aberrant actin regulation , or due to aberrant membrane trafficking of receptors such as integrins or LPAR1 ( this study ) . In particular , pancreatic tumours appear to directly invade into the wall of the bowel due to the close proximity of these two organs and in human patients , duodenal invasion has also been observed . While we were not able to measure RAC1 activity in tumours directly , it would be desirable to do this in the future , using such tools as a RAC1 FRET biosensor mouse model . CYRI-B autoantibodies were detected as a potential biomarker for early stage breast cancer , a gene found in patient serum on extrachromosomal circular DNA overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma and a potential saliva marker of oral cancer . Interestingly , a major mechanism for internalisation of LPAR1 appears to be via macropinocytosis , as we observed LPAR1 on the membrane surface of both nascent and internalised macropinocytic structures co-localising with CYRI-B . Similarly , with macropinocytosis , RAC1 needs to be transiently activated to allow actin assembly and cup formation , but then RAC1 is dampened and actin needs to be disassembled to allow closure and uptake of macropinosomes or phagocytic vesicles into the cell . It is unclear why diaphragm and bowel metastasis were not significantly affected by CYRI-B deletion , but this might be due to the proximity of the tumours to these sites . While N-WASP localises to SNX9-positive membrane tubules that are involved in trafficking of LPAR1 back to the plasma membrane after internalisation , we find that CYRI-B is required for efficient internalisation of LPAR1 after stimulation . Likewise , RAC1 and PI3-kinase are important for apicobasal polarity in the pancreas and RAC1 has a known role in acinar to ductal metaplasia and in polarity and cell identity during early PDAC progression . CYRI-B was also highlighted as a target of the zinc finger RNA-binding protein Zfrbp , leading to accelerated tumour development when overexpressed in colorectal and liver cancers . This suggests that macropinocytosis , which has recently attracted substantial interest as a regulator of nutrient uptake by PDAC cells , is also a key mechanism by which cells control surface receptor trafficking . It would also be interesting to determine whether CYRI-A is involved in pancreatic cancer progression , as we previously implicated this protein in RAC1 binding and macropinocytosis . We previously found that loss of N-WASP in the KPC model caused a reduction in metastasis and that the role of N-WASP in recycling the LPA receptor LPAR1

This process is called chemokine , and it is thought that this process is responsible for the growth of new cells in the body . However , there is no clear way to know how this process works . To study this process , a group of scientists have developed a new protein called Cyrib . Cyrib is a protein that is found in the pancreas and helps cells to move around . It is also known to be involved in a process called macropinocytosis , where cells are able to take in nutrients from the environment . In some cases , the cells that carry out this process are more likely to be cancerous than others , but it is not clear how this happens .

[ABSTRACT] 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between env and the 3′ long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K ( HML-8 ) -related virus . HERV-K ( HML-2 ) , the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses ( HERVs ) , includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses , but no replication competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans . We show that the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element ( CTE ) , indicating the ancestral Rec-RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism . Age estimates , intact open reading frames , and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques . The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3 , which disrupt the Rec Response Element ( RcRE ) , required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA . HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates , including rhesus macaques , but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear . This clade is found in Old World monkeys ( OWM ) , but not great apes , suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split . We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons ; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade , suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons . We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques , including a clade of young , rhesus-specific insertions .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Rhesus macaques are a well-characterized model organism for human disease ; if these viruses are still actively replicating in macaques or other OWM species , they could provide an opportunity to observe the infection dynamics of an HML-2-like virus in a natural host , which could provide insights on currently incompletely understood aspects of HML-2 biology , such as tropism , pathogenic potential , receptor usage , and mode of transmission . Lastly , we have demonstrated that SERV-K/MER11 contains a novel CTE ; this provides a fascinating opportunity to investigate the evolution of a retrovirus as it shifted from using a Rev/RRE-type system to a CTE-type system , and to observe how two closely related viruses that use very different RNA trafficking mechanisms differ in their replication dynamics . We were unable to estimate integration times for most of the gibbon proviruses because their 5′ and 3′ LTRs had discordant phylogenies , indicating that they have undergone some type of recombination event ; one provirus appears to be derived from a crossover recombination between two separate proviruses , resulting in a reciprocal chromosomal translocation . We investigated the coding capacity of these proviruses , and identified full-length ORFs for all genes , including 28 gag , 13 pro , 6 pol , and 7 env ORFs ; two proviruses have intact ORFs for the full gag-pro-pol region and could thus potentially make functional retroviral cores , although they are lacking env , and so could not make infectious virus without complementation in trans from a provirus encoding a functional env gene . In order to test the CTE functionality of the SERV-K/MER11 HML-8-derived region in the context of a replicating , natively CTE-using virus , we cloned this region ( including both the HML-8 env-derived region and the MER11 element ) into a GFP-tagged MPMV infectious clone in place of the original MPMV CTE , and tested this construct 's ability to generate infectious virus in a single round , VSV-G pseudotyped assay . Interestingly , the HML-2 env-derived sequence in between the MER11 element and the 3′ LTR is ~240 bp long in the oldest SERV-K/MER11 proviruses , but has been reduced to a short remnant containing the PPT in the rhesus-specific clade , as one might predict since it no longer has a function as part of the env ORF . This tree structure may indicate an earlier interspecies transmission from a cercopithecine monkey to a colobine lineage ancestral to the GSM , which later crossed into gibbons ; however , these deeper nodes in the phylogenies are relatively low confidence , and we can not rule out alternative evolutionary scenarios . However , there are other examples of CTE-like elements much longer than the MPMV CTE ; the MusD transport element ( MTE ) is 412 bp long , and the murine leukemia virus ( MLV ) post-transcriptional regulatory element ( PTE ) is over 1400 bp long , while the woodchuck hepatitis virus ( WHV ) post-transcriptional regulatory element or WPRE ( known to enhance both export and translation of RNAs ) is 592 bp long . We can not completely rule out the possibility that sRec still has some unspliced RNA transport activity , but the RcRE deletions and presence of an Rec-independent CTE in the MER11 element in combination with the lack of any promotion of unspliced RNA transport in our experiments by an sRec plasmid suggests any such activity is likely minimal . The evidence for at least one and possibly more such transmission events is strong , and geographic proximity makes contact between the GSM and white-cheeked gibbon lineages plausible ; however , both species are herbivorous , removing perhaps the most straightforward route of transmission , predation , from consideration . The presence
[METHODS] ",,918,94,None,"Many viruses , including viruses that cause cancer , can be transmitted to humans by a variety of different animals . However , it is not clear how these viruses are transmitted , and how they are transmitted to other animals , or how they can be used as models to study human diseases . The HERV-K ( HML-2 ) , the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses , is found in rhesus macaques , but it has not been identified in humans . It has been suggested that the HML-8-derived region of the RNA encoded by the virus is responsible for the transmission of the virus . This region is known as a constitutive transport element ( CTE ) and has been linked to a number of other viruses .

They also found that some of the genes in the env gene are missing , suggesting that the RcER was replaced with a new CTE mechanism .

[ABSTRACT] Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds , elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process . Examining over 23 , 000 cells , we created a comprehensive single-cell atlas that captures the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds . Additionally , E. faecalis infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro , in vivo , and in our scRNA-seq atlas . Wound infections are highly prevalent and can lead to delayed or failed healing , causing significant morbidity and adverse economic impacts . To address this , we employed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model . Furthermore , we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils , which regulates chemokine signaling pathways , while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells . Enterococcus faecalis is often found in persistent non-healing wounds , but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied . We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection , jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment . Overall , our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faecalis in wound infections . These infections occur in various contexts , including diabetic foot ulcers , burns , and surgical sites . Notably , E. faecalis infection prompted a premature , incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes .

Our study provides a comprehensive comparison of the transcriptomic and cellular communication profiles between uninfected and E. faecalis-infected full-thickness mouse skin wounds at 4 days post-infection .

[ABSTRACT] This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants , by revealing that they can do both in sequence . Using a custom-built , high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( PTR-ToF-MS ) system , we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants . We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants , characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure . Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern . Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants ( senders ) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants ( receivers ) , however , the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon remain poorly studied . Instead , it is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day . The delayed burst occurs independent of day : night light transitions and can not be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics . This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night , but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Given these considerations , together with the observed volatile release , response kinetics , and our manipulative experiments , we can draw up the following scenario : On day 1 , maize plants are exposed to GLVs , which trigger a small burst of terpene release in receiver plants . So far , studies in maize and other plants showing priming effects have often exposed receiver plants to HIPVs for several hours , overnight , or even for multiple days , and induced them , e. g. , by simulated herbivory , on the following day in the absence of HIPVs . Responding on the second day could be advantageous , as by this time , the natural enemies would have located and interacted with the herbivores on sender plants , and would thus be ready to move over to the next plant in anticipation of herbivore arrival . As fitness outcomes are likely highly nuanced , especially considering HIPVs also attract herbivores , investigation into information transfer on the multi-plant scale , namely in the context of multi-trophic interactions , will be critical . Although it has been established for decades that plants transmit airborne chemical information between individuals , we are only scratching the surface of the dynamic nature of this phenomenon . Additionally , considering we observed an induction in jasmonates coinciding with terpene bursts it is likely that non-volatile jasmonate-dependent defenses follow similar temporal patterns . Airborne information transfer has the potential to play a major role in plant communities , as it functions as a signaling viaduct between plants not physically connected to one another . Our experiments reveal the importance of tracking plant defense responses in real time as they perceive the dynamic natural volatile blend of herbivore-attacked neighbors . Defense activation can happen directly , with plants increasing their defense hormone production and volatile release , and/or via priming effects , with plants increasing their defenses more strongly upon a secondary stimulus . Thus , responding most strongly to repeated GLV exposure could avoid false negatives and allow plants to respond more robustly to the presence of actual herbivory . The kinetics of information transfer at the detailed temporal resolution of this study provide some insights regarding how HIPVs act across time and space . Here , we show that these two phenomena operate together to trigger strong defense activation in receiver plants with predictable temporal kinetics . Our findings demonstrate that more natural continuous exposure to volatiles results in the same pattern without the need for another stimulus . We find that this is the result of volatile-mediated priming on the first day that yields a clocked response to the volatiles that are perceived the next day . Further experiments will reveal whether similar patterns are observed in other plants , and how they may operate on a mechanistic level . We show that , somewhat surprisingly , upon continuous exposure to HIPVs , receiver plants show a pronounced activation of defenses at the onset of the second day . At the same time , receiver plants are primed to respond more strongly on the next day , once light is restored . What is the mechanism that results in a strong activation of defenses on the onset of the second day of exposure to HIPVs ? Indeed , such a setup would reveal clear priming , with minor or no direct induction by the volatile treatment . Considerable work will be needed to understand whether the observed defense activation pattern has any adaptive benefit . The orchestration of these elements is noteworthy and results in a predictable response pattern under variable HIPV exposure . Attracting natural enemies too early to herbivore-free plants could have fitness costs for both the plant and herbivore natural enemies . On this basis , a more comprehensive understanding of
[METHODS] ",,905,94,None,"Plants communicate with each other by sending chemical signals to each other . This communication is called information transfer , and it is important to understand how plants respond to these signals . For example , if a plant is attacked by a herbivore , it can send a chemical signal to the next plant . The chemical signals are then sent to the neighboring plant , which is then attacked by another plant – called a sender . When the sender plants are attacked , the chemical signals become more active , leading to a burst of volatiles . However , how this happens is not well understood . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( PTR-ToF-MS ) to study how plants react to volatiles in their neighboring plants . In the first day , plants were exposed to terpenes , an airborne chemical that can be found in the air . Next , they were given a second dose of the chemical , called GLV , to activate their defenses against the herbies . After the second dose , plant defenses were activated , but this was not the first time that plants were attacked . Wang also found that the plants responded to the first dose of GLV in the second day . These results suggest that plants can respond to GLVs in a similar way , even if they are not attacked by the herbions ."

[ABSTRACT] Remarkably , three temporally and acoustically distinct call rhythms in the lower stratum were not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples , which suggests that these recursive structures were neither the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures nor anatomical artifacts of bodily constraints or resonances . There are , however , no known vocal sequences among nonhuman primates arranged in self-embedded patterns that evince vocal recursion or potential incipient or evolutionary transitional forms thereof , suggesting a neuro-cognitive transformation exclusive to humans . Second-order combinatorics , 'sequences within sequences ' , involving hierarchically organized and cyclically structured vocal sounds in ancient hominids may have preluded the evolution of recursion in modern language-able humans . Recursive procedures that allow placing a vocal signal inside another of a similar kind provide a neuro-computational blueprint for syntax and phonology in spoken language and human song . Here , we uncover that wild flanged male orangutan long calls feature rhythmically isochronous call sequences nested within isochronous call sequences , consistent with two hierarchical strata . Findings represent a case of temporally recursive hominid vocal combinatorics in the absence of syntax , semantics , phonology , or music .
[INTRODUCTION]

[DISCUSSION] Such classifications may be putting the proverbial cart before the horse ; they are based on untested assumptions that may not have applied to proto-recursive ancestors , for example , that syntax and phonology evolved as separate 'modules ' , that one attained modern form before the other , or that they evolved in hominids regardless of whether consonant-like and vowel-like calls were present or not . The occurrence of three non-exclusive recursive patterns ( i. e. , three acoustically distinct sub-pulse calls occurring at three distinct tempi nested within the same pulse-level tempo ) substantially decreases the probability that recursion was the by-product of anatomic constraints , such as vocal fold oscillation , breath length , heartbeat , and other physiological processes or movements . Future studies on primate vocal combinatorics , particularly undertaking a structural approach and in the wild , offer promising new paths to empirically assess possible precursors and proto-states for the evolution of recursion within the hominid family , also adding temporal recursion as a new layer of analysis . Any differences between our findings and recursion in today 's syntax , phonology , or music do not logically reject the possibility that recursive isochrony represents an ancient , and perhaps ancestral , state for the evolution of vocal recursion within the hominid family . Yet , the possibility of self-embedded isochrony , or non-exclusive self-embedded patterns occurring within the same signal sequence , has on no account been formulated or conjectured as a possible state of recursive signaling , be it in vertebrates , mammals , primates , or otherwise , extant or extinct . These crucial data on the evolution of recursion , language , and cognition along the human lineage will materialize if , as stewards of our planetary co-habitants , humankind secures the survival of nonhuman primates and the preservation of their habitats in the wild . Loud calling is an archetypal trait in primates and among ancient hominids it could have preceded , and subsequently transmuted , into modern recursive vocal structures in humans , as found today in the form of song and chants . The discovery of recursive vocal patterns organized along two hierarchical temporal levels in a hominid besides humans suggests that 'sequences within sequences ' may have been present in ancestral hominids , and hence , that second-order sequences may have predated the emergence of language in the human lineage . Therefore , ear anatomy offers confidence that orangutans ( and other great apes ) , like humans , perceive sub-pulse rhythmic motifs at these rates as such , that is , a train of signals , instead of one uninterrupted signal . Such processes can generate frequency patterns nested within others ; however , in these cases , sub-frequencies occur in the form of harmonics related to the reference ( dominant ) frequency and to each other by small whole-numbered multiples . Human and nonhuman great apes have similar auditory capacities , and there are limited skeletal differences in inner ear anatomy to suggest significantly distinct sensitivity , resolution , or activation thresholds in the time domain . Resolution may come through a re-evaluation of previous studies with further related taxa and with experimental tests designed within a richer and more articulated panorama of observations on vocal combinatorics in wild great apes . Together , our findings suggest that recursive isochrony is not the absolute result of raw mechanics but is instead likely generated or tampered with by , at least , one temporally recursive neuro-motor procedure . Given the dearth of such data , findings imply that it may be too hasty to discuss whether combinatorial capacities in primates or birds are equivalent to those engaged in syntax or phonology . This opens the intriguing , tentative possibility that recursive vocal combinatorics were first and foremost a feature of proto-musical expression in human ancestors , later recruited and 're-engineered ' for the generation of
[METHODS] ",,888,93,None,"The brain is made up of neurons , which are connected to each other by a network of connections called neurons . These connections are called recursive neural circuits , or recursion . During a human’s life , a vocal signal is placed inside another of a similar kind , called a “sequence within sequence” . This process is known as recurrent neural circuitry , and it has been suggested that the earliest hominids had a system called “selectronics” that allowed them to place a signal inside another . However , it was not clear how relapsed neural circuitries evolved . Now , Wang et al . show that flanged male orangutan long calls feature rhythmically isochronous call sequences that are arranged along two hierarchical temporal levels . The calls are nested within two distinct temporal regions , but they were not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples . Wang also found that three distinct patterns of call were found in the lower stratum , suggesting that these patterns were not the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures or anatomical artifacts of bodily constraints or resonances ; instead , they were arranged in a pattern that was not associated with a higher level . In contrast , the calls were not associated to the higher level of the call , either because of anatomically restricted movements or aural constraints . Thus , these findings suggest that a second-order combinatoric system may have preluded the evolution of vocal reursion in humans ."

[ABSTRACT] Firstly , the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes , with homology-dependent genetic compensation response ( HDGCR ) being the main pathway . In summary , our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus , offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system . Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of M. miiuy and Gallus gallus , the homolog of RIG-I , can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5'ppp-RNA virus , which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution . Secondly , as an adversarial strategy , 5'ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability , thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion . During this process , the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection . Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5'ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish , Miichthys miiuy . The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life 's evolution .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Next , by linking the immune replacement ability evolved by MDA5 with the common RIG-I loss event in vertebrates , we propose a straightforward explanation for this evolutionary event : In the lengthy process of vertebrate evolution , MDA5 gradually acquired new functionalities to effectively detect viruses such as 5'ppp-RNAs , which were initially recognized by RIG-I . SCRV and VSV belongs to the class of rhabdovirus , which is a negative-strand virus with a non-segmented genome and initiate both replication and transcription de novo leading to 5′-triphosphate RNA in the cytosol , was expected to trigger an IFN response without the need for replication and presumed dsRNA formation . Fish and birds , as the most abundant aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates respectively , are also the two lineages with the most frequent occurrence of RIG-I deficiency , the investigation of host-pathogen interactions of them offers valuable insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system . In our previous study , we discovered that SCRV infection can not only increase overall cellular methylation levels but also upregulate the expression of METTL3 , thereby suggesting its potential to regulate host gene expression through the m6A mechanism . Previous research has revealed that in T. belangeri , concurrent with the loss of RIG-I , both MDA5 and LGP2 have undergone notable positive selection , and MDA5 or MDA5/LGP2 could sense Sendai virus ( an RNA virus posed as a RIG-I agonist ) for inducing type I IFN . For instance , following infection by human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) , the IFN-β transcript was modified by m6A , and this methylation decreased its half-life , suggesting that HCMV can exploit this control of IFN-β expression to facilitate its replication by increasing m6A modification of the IFN-β transcript and thus decreasing its production . This hypothesis is supported by two viewpoints : first , MDA5 and RIG-I can both recognize overlapping viruses Schoggins et al. , 2015 ; secondly , in fish without RIG-I deficiency , MDA5 has stronger antiviral ability compared to RIG-I . In this study , we characterized the consequences resulting from the loss of RIG-I in the M. miiuy and G. gallus ( two representative species of vertebrates lacking RIG-I ) and provided direct functional evidence for the alternative immune recognition function of MDA5 . However , similar to the interaction observed between MDA5 and STING in tree shrews and chickens that lacking RIG-I , the MDA5 of M. miiuy can also interact with STING protein , indicating that in vertebrates lacking RIG-I , MDA5 may utilize STING to facilitate signal transduction in the antiviral response . For example , the loss of m6A site or removing m6A from human metapneumovirus may weaken its immune evasion ability , prevent it from evading detection by RIG-I , and result in higher levels of IFN release . While changes in m6A modification and the expression of m6A-modified transcripts are biologically relevant , identifying bona fide m6A alterations during viral infection will allow us to understand how m6A modification of cellular mRNA is regulated . In another study , the m6A reader YTHDF3 could restrain the type I IFN response and ISG expression by involving enhancement of FOXO3 translation in a m6A-independent mechanism , which acts as a negative regulator of immunity . Specifically , we conducted an evolutionary analysis and provided functional evidence to confirm that MDA5 of M. miiuy and G. gallus has acquired an additional function of sensing 5'ppp-RNA , thus compensating for the loss of RIG-I . But this does not imply that there has been no loss event among them , but rather , there is insufficient information regarding the genomes of reptiles and amphibians to draw the conclusions . As the abundance of genomic data continues to grow , there will be an increasing amount of evidence available
[METHODS] ",,900,93,None,"The immune system is made up of a group of proteins called viral receptors . These proteins are found on the surface of the cell , and they are used to detect viruses . In some cases , these proteins can also be used to recognize other viruses , such as viruses that cause cancer . However , it is not clear how these proteins interact with each other . For example , in mammals , the immune system detects viruses that are transmitted to humans , but it does not detect viruses transmitted to animals . This is because viruses can use a protein called RIG-I , which is a receptor on the cell surface , to detect other viruses that can infect humans . It is not known how this protein interacts with other viruses in the body . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called genetics to study the interactions between viruses and their hosts . The experiments showed that the genes that make up RIG–I are encoded by a gene called Gallus gallus , a species of fish that has a mutation in the gene that makes it more likely to recognize viruses that have previously been detected by RIG—and that this gene can be replaced by another protein called MDA5 . Wang flies a fish called Miichthys miiuy , that is able to recognize 5’ppp-RNA viruses that were previously detected by the RIG signaling protein . Previous studies have shown that the MDA-5 protein can replace RIG in response to a virus , although it was not clear whether this could be the case in other species . Now , Zhang e"

[ABSTRACT] Since androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) has a profound impact on circulating FSH concentrations , this hormone could potentially be implicated in the changes of fat body mass ( FBM ) , lean body mass ( LBM ) , and bone fragility induced by ADT . The objective of this study is to correlate FSH serum levels with body composition parameters , bone mineral density ( BMD ) , and bone turnover markers at baseline conditions and after 12 months of ADT . Therefore , FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and to guide the clinicians in the tailored evaluation of body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT .

Twenty-nine consecutive non-metastatic prostate cancer ( PC ) patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2019 in a phase IV study . On the other hand , an inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio was observed ( r = −0 . FBM , LBM , and BMD were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 12 months of ADT . Among its extragonadal effects , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) has an impact on body composition and bone metabolism . For outcome measurements and statistical analysis , t-test or sign test and Pearson or Spearman tests for continuous variables were used when indicated .

[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Indeed , the protocol of BLADE study did not include measurement of testosterone values , since radioimmunoassay and chemiluminescence assay used in clinical practice could overestimate testosterone levels in majority of patients under ADTs , leaving a concern of misdiagnosing truly castrate patients as being inadequately treated . FSH could be a promising marker in monitoring PC patients during ADT in order to identify those who are more vulnerable and at greater risk of alterations in body composition , which can be captured and measured reliably by DXA . However , since sex hormones were not measured in our patients , it was unclear whether the possible variability in testosterone values during degarelix treatment might have influenced the detrimental effects of FSH and body composition . During the recent years , there has been consistent evidence that alterations in body composition could contribute to determine skeletal fragility in patients under ADT , such as well demonstrated in other forms of male hypogonadism . As demonstrated in other studies prospectively evaluating circulating FSH levels after treatment with LHRH agonists and antagonists , degarelix administration consistently reduced FSH values , although values might be variable among individuals under ADT . These associations were not significant before starting degarelix , suggesting that sex hormones might counteract FSH effect on body composition at baseline conditions , whereas this effect becomes more evident after ADT . This ancillary analysis of the BLADE study shows that higher serum levels of FSH during degarelix treatment were significantly associated with higher total , limbs , and trunk fat mass . We can infer therefore that the effect was caused by the direct relationship of FBM since there was no correlation between lean mass and FSH in this study . Of course further investigation is required to establish the association between FSH serum levels , measured during ADT , and sarcopenic obesity risk in PC patients . Moreover , higher FSH values under ADT were associated with lower ALMI/FBM ratio , a parameter that identifies patients at high risk for sarcopenic obesity . To our knowledge , this is the first study showing an association between circulating FSH levels and body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT . In conclusion , the findings of this study suggest that FSH serum levels after ADT could impact body composition - FBM in particular - in PC patients undergoing ADT . According to our data , PC patients treated with LHRH antagonists may experience less body composition changes due to lower FSH residual values . As a matter of fact , low testosterone values do not seem to be the only determinant of sarcopenic obesity in males with hypogonadism . In this context , it is reasonable to hypothesize that variable values of FSH might directly influence body composition and skeletal fragility . It is known that one of the most noticeable differences of LHRH antagonists compared to LHRH agonists are FSH levels during therapy , which are mildly higher with LHRH agonists compared to LHRH antagonists . ADT in PC patients leads to an increase in fat mass and to a decrease in lean mass , thus increasing the

[ABSTRACT] We used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic HF , such as a prolonged QT interval , a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD , and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2 . Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation , thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD . These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation , such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD . We tested the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability , mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function . We assessed the incidence of VT/VF and SCD ( primary outcome ) , ECG heart rate and QT variability , echocardiographic left ventricular ( LV ) structure and function , immunohistochemical LV fibrosis , and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation . Compared to placebo , DS lowered resting heart rate , preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge , and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function . Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation ( VT/VF ) is a leading cause of death , but current therapies are limited . Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels , none have proven sufficiently effective for preventing SCD . Sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 ( RyR2 ) Ca2+ release channels , the downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels , are underexplored in this context . Recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) -mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s in the pathophysiology of SCD . DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias . HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene ( DS ) or placebo in early or chronic HF . Moreover , the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] This study demonstrates that inhibition of Ca2+ leak via RyR2 pauses the transition to heart failure by reducing cardiac fibrosis , increasing repolarization lability , and decreasing QT heterogeneity , improving chronotropic competency , ultimately improving LV contractility , and mitigating lethal VT/VF . Damage caused by oxidative stress alters the proteomic profile of the cell , including altering expression levels as well as the structure and function of EC-coupling proteins . Given that dantrolene is available for clinical use , future studies should evaluate its efficacy in humans with heart failure .
[METHODS] ",,447,64,Low token utilization (447/1024),"Heart failure , or HF , is a serious health problem that affects millions of people worldwide . It is caused by a build-up of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in the bloodstream , which can cause damage to the heart and lead to heart failure . The oxidative stress caused by ROS causes the blood vessels to leak more blood , leading to a loss of blood flow . This can lead to cardiac death , but it is not known how this happens . One of the main causes of heart failure is ventricular tachycardia , a condition in which the heart fails to pump blood to the rest of the body . In humans , this happens when the heart stops working properly . However , it can also lead to death if the heart is not properly regulated . A drug called dantrolene has been shown to reduce the levels of ROS in the heart , and it is currently available for clinical use . To test this idea , Weiss et al . used a guinea pig model to study the effects of a drug that inhibits the activity of the sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 ( RyR2 ) . Using a mouse model of HF and a human model , we found that dantsrolenone reduced the levels in the repolarization of the left ventricular wall , increasing the ability of the heart to pump water , improving the ability to contract the left heart . These results suggest that reducing the level of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ in the right ventricular walls can help prevent heart failure and HF in humans .

[ABSTRACT] Smads and their transcription factor partners mediate the transcriptional responses of target cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) family , including those of the conserved bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) family , yet only a small number of direct target genes have been well characterized . Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that in turn regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation . Here , we identify functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri based on ChIP-seq peaks ( identified by modEncode ) and expression differences of nearby genes identified from RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants . Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) secretory pathway , including the disulfide reductase dpy-11 . Mutations in sma-9 partially suppress the small body size phenotype of sma-3 , suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnurri function . At a genome-wide scale , SMA-3/Smad acts as a transcriptional activator , whereas SMA-9/Schnurri direct targets include both activated and repressed genes . In C. elegans , the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates multiple biological functions , including body size , via a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade . We found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] One powerful element of our approach was that our ChIP-seq/RNA-seq BETA analysis identified direct target genes and combined those findings with a functional analysis of a subset of those targets , thereby demonstrating that a combination of SMA-3-exclusive targets ( including chaperones and collagen secretion factors ) work together with SMA-3/SMA-9 co-regulated targets ( including collagen genes and factors involved in one-carbon metabolism ) to affect the process of body growth through their regulation of the extracellular matrix of the surrounding cuticle . By using an analysis pipeline that combines BETA , which integrates ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to identify targets , with LOA , which integrates two separate RNA-seq pairwise comparisons to identify shared DEGs , we identified nearby direct transcriptional targets based on their functional impact on transcript levels in corresponding mutants . The thioredoxin-like DPY-11 was a particularly compelling target given its established role in cuticle formation and the dramatic effect of its loss on body size growth , as well as the known role of these enzymes in processing secreted proteins moving through the ER/Golgi network . The significant number of shared ( co-regulated ) target genes with overlapping binding peaks is consistent with a model in which SMA-3 and SMA-9 bind as a complex ( or at least adjacent along DNA ) , as has been demonstrated at a few loci in Drosophila and Xenopus . Alternatively , these sites could have an additional role in DBL-1 signaling besides transcriptional regulation of nearby genes , or they could be regulating the expression of target genes at a far enough distance to not be detected by our BETA analysis . 6 , nath-10 , and hsp-3 reduced body size in lon-2 ; rrf-3 double mutants but not in rrf-3 single mutants , suggesting that they might be factors whose effects are only detectable in the context of an overactive pathway ; these warrant future study . An enrichment of ER secretion and chaperone factors in the list of direct targets involved in body size growth was unexpected , but reasonable given that one of the key functions of the hypodermis is to secrete cuticular collagen . We chose the second larval ( L2 ) stage because Smad activity is elevated at this stage as determined by the RAD-SMAD activity reporter , and because this stage is the earliest point at which one can observe a clear difference for one of the best-studied Smad mutant phenotypes : body size growth . Consistent with a secretion defect , we found a corresponding decrease in the amount of ROL-6 : :wrmScarlet in the cuticle of sma-3 mutants , although not in sma-9 mutants , which could reflect the differential enrichment of dpy-11 and chaperones in the list of SMA-3-exclusive target genes . Canonical signaling is mediated by the Smad transcription factor complex , but Smad binding sites are too degenerate and have low affinity to account for the specific context-dependent effects , so transcription factor partners must also be involved . We also performed body size measurements on RNAi knockdowns for identified target genes in an RNAi-sensitive strain , examining their effect in both a wild-type background and a lon-2 background in which DBL-1 signaling is exaggerated , resulting in an elongated body size . We remain cautious in our interpretation of this result , as blocking ER secretion with tunicamycin could affect the secretion of the BMP receptors or other proteins that function together with the receptors , which could also lead to a body size defect . These genes had GO terms associated with either one-carbon metabolism or chaperone/ER secretion , suggesting that the upregulation of these activities is a key aspect of how DBL-1 signaling promotes growth ( Figure 8 ) . While both single mutants were phenotypically small ,

[ABSTRACT] DUX4 expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort , with DUX4 expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year . The embryonic transcription factor DUX4 was recently characterized as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation that is aberrantly expressed in a small subset of primary tumors . Here , we report that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors , with ~10-50 % of advanced bladder , breast , kidney , prostate , and skin cancers expressing DUX4 . DUX4 expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients . Our data motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance . Cancer immune evasion contributes to checkpoint immunotherapy failure in many patients with metastatic cancers .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While the mechanism governing DUX4 de-repression in cancer remains to be elucidated , we show that DUX4 expression in the metastatic context is associated with reduced anti-tumor immunity , mirroring previous observations in primary cancers and cancer cell line models , and is correlated with decreased patient survival under ICI treatment . Altogether , these results possibly indicate the existence of co-occurring conditions in patients with higher degrees of disability , predisposing them to adverse effects associated with ICI treatment- comorbidities whose effects presumably manifest shortly after therapy commencement . As these become available in the future , extending the analyses we have outlined in this study will be important to appraise DUX4 's definitive clinical relevance , contextualized among response-modifying clinical variables , in the use of immunotherapy in the treatment of metastatic cancer . We also report that DUX4 expression in metastasis is correlated with downregulation of TIGIT and other immune checkpoints whose interception are currently under clinical investigation : HAVCR2/TIM3 and LAG3 . However , our current study is limited by the availability of sufficiently sized ICI-treated cohorts with associated patient data on relevant characteristics such as demographics and risk factors . ECOG PS negatively impacts patient survival during ICI therapy , inferred from our multivariate Cox PH analysis and from findings of the IMvigor210 clinical trial : patients with ECOG PS = 2 ( n = 24 ) had a median overall survival of 8 . For example , patients with advanced melanoma that is nonresponsive to anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy have higher frequencies of genetic alterations associated with IFN-γ signaling defects compared to responsive patients . Our data underscore the utility of time-dependent approaches in identifying covariate-linked survival effects which may not be apparent in a summary computed over the entire time period . Our sequence analyses show that DUX4 transcripts in the metastatic context contain the full-length coding region , suggestive of an intact capability as a STAT1 suppressor . Intriguingly , these analyses revealed the outsize influence of ECOG PS , a measure of patient functional status , on survival at early timepoints relative to other patient covariates . For instance , the contribution of DUX4 expression to survival prediction is most prominent at later timepoints , suggesting principal effects on long-term survival . The prognostic value of IFN-γ activity and its non-redundancy relative to TMB in terms of influencing ICI response is widely appreciated . Screening for DUX4 tumor expression , with binarized results such as through IHC using anti-DUX4 antibodies , could have clinical utility . DUX4 has been implicated in modifying IFN-γ activity through direct binding and inhibition of STAT1 via its C-terminal domain . DUX4 's ubiquitous expression across metastatic cancers and our controlled survival analyses emphasize DUX4 as an underappreciated contributor to ICI resistance . Second , the pervasive expression of DUX4 in all the metastatic cohorts we examined exhibits its potential as a pan-cancer biomarker . 1 months , lower than the subgroup with ECOG PS < 2 ( n = 35 ) whose median survival was not reached during the observation period . Other studies have similarly reported poorer outcomes associated with ICI treatment in patients with high ECOG PS . Our previous work showed that DUX4 expression is associated with resistance to anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies . In our current study , we comprehensively demonstrate that DUX4 modulates patient response to PD-L1 blockade . Additional randomized trial data from diverse metastatic cancer cohorts , with adequate genomic and clinical data , is imperative . We show that binary categorization of patients according to DUX4 expression status was sufficient to stratify patients according to ICI response . DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastasis and may be an important driver of immune evasion . Our RSF model allowed us to interrogate changes in variable importance over time . First , DUX4 expression may promote patient resistance in a wide array of ICI modalities . Our data motivate the investigation into DUX4 's potential to prognosticate response to ICI .

[ABSTRACT] Several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa surveillance data rarely include information from abortions , little is known about aetiology and impacts , and data are not available to inform interventions . If so , samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate ( a ) determinants of attribution ; ( b ) patterns of events , including species and breed , previous abortion history , and seasonality ; ( c ) determinants of reporting , investigation and attribution ; ( d ) cases involving zoonotic pathogens . Livestock abortion surveillance , even at a small scale , can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks , reproductive losses and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance . This study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system , achieved through engagement of community-based field officers , establishment of practical sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic platforms . This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform established in Tanzania spanning pastoral , agropastoral and smallholder systems to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion . Lack of data on the aetiology of livestock diseases constrains effective interventions to improve livelihoods , food security and public health . Between 2017-2019 , 215 events in cattle ( n=71 ) , sheep ( n=44 ) , and goats ( n=100 ) were investigated . Abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers ( LFO ) and on to investigation teams . Events were included if the research team or LFO could attend within 72 hr . Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples . Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome affecting productivity and public health . 5 % of cases , was significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples . Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection . Attribution , achieved for 19 .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] One possible explanation is that , in comparison to sheep and cattle , fewer data are available worldwide on causes of abortions in goats and very little is known about the aetiology of goat abortions in Africa , so the pathogens included in our diagnostic panel may not have been as relevant for goats as for sheep and cattle . Our results may simply reflect a higher likelihood of reporting of abortion in animals that are of higher value and more likely to be zero-grazed or tethered while grazing ( and hence abortions would be more apparent ) and for which an existing relationship with animal health services is more likely . The risk of exposure to zoonotic pathogens through abortion cases was underscored by two findings : first that , in nearly 80 % of cases in which a pathogen was detected , the pathogen was zoonotic and second , that in nearly a quarter of all cases , someone had assisted with the aborted delivery , very likely without any form of personal protective equipment . Recent studies have indicated that the economic costs of livestock abortion in Tanzania and impacts on food security are much more substantial than previously recognized ; for example estimated the annual gross losses associated with abortion in Tanzania to be $ 262 million USD . The study demonstrated the utility , acceptability , and feasibility of livestock abortion as a target for both syndromic and event-based surveillance and showed that an effective reporting and investigation system could be operationalized across a range of settings in Tanzania , including remote rural areas . This work might include the investigation of rapid point-of-care testing and the use of mobile phone technology to speed up the detection and reporting back of results to LFOs and livestock keepers , with the potential to facilitate the capture of data for use in national disease surveillance databases . Additionally , investigating the effectiveness of syndromic or event-based surveillance more broadly , targeting syndromes other than abortion , would provide further evidence demonstrating whether this type of surveillance can be implemented , in a cost-effective manner , at scale . Data from the household questionnaire indicated that livestock abortion was a common occurrence across the study area with almost a third of cattle herds and two-thirds of small ruminant herds having experienced a previous case of abortion in the preceding 12 months . In conclusion , this study has demonstrated that livestock abortion surveillance , even at a relatively small scale , can capture valuable aetiological and epidemiological information on important livestock pathogens , including those that are zoonotic and those with epidemic potential . Given these findings , data collected on the number of cases and species/breed affected will be of considerable value in highlighting the importance of this syndrome in the context of livestock productivity , household livelihoods and food security . Key elements of effectiveness were high levels of engagement of community-based field officers , the establishment of practical and robust field sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic techniques , with prompt response to reporting of cases , and timely feedback of results . During this study , samples were tested for only 10 abortigenic pathogens and it is likely that rates of detection and attribution would be higher with inclusion of tests for other known abortigenic agents ( such as Listeria spp. , Campylobacter spp. , Salmonella spp . Our study suggests a possible role for recent stressful events , including episodes of drought and attacks by wild predators , which were reported
[METHODS] ",,956,96,None,"Livestock abortion is a disease that affects millions of people worldwide . It is caused by a parasite called zoonotic worms , which can infect animals . The parasites are transmitted to humans and animals by the animal’s fetus , and they can cause serious health problems , such as cancer , heart disease and diabetes . However , it is not clear how these diseases are transmitted . In Africa , there are many different types of livestock abortion , including sheep , goats and cattle . There is also a lack of information on the causes of abortions . This is especially true in rural areas where there is fewer people grazing . One way to find out more about the causes and effects of abortion is to use a method called molecular diagnostics – which can be used to identify pathogens that are not easily captured by other methods . For example , a bacterium known as a protozoan worm can be detected in urine , blood , saliva , or saliva . But it is unclear how this can be done . To investigate the causes , the researchers used a technique called PCR . PCR was used to test for a variety of bacteria , but it was not able to detect a pathogen . Instead , samples were collected from farmers and field officers , who were involved in the investigation . These volunteers were asked to provide information about the cause of abortion . They were asked if they could attend to the event . A survey was conducted to assess the results of the survey . Results showed that 99% of the cases were reported by farmers , while 5% were reported to investigators based on their ability to attend . Overall , this study shows that a surveillance system can be implemented"

[ABSTRACT] Moreover , NIC induces Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif ( TAZ ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAchR ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation ; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells . Hence , this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors . In this study , we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) in vivo and ex vivo . NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc , DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth . Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases . The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs . However , knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited . Nicotine ( NIC ) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In contrast , our analysis validates that NIC affects ISC rather than Panth cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling activated though nAchRa7 by mRNA and protein analyses of sorted ISCs or Paneth cells and ex vivo functional assays . Similarly , the expression of target proteins ( Sox9 , TCF4 and , C-myc ) of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as well as cell-cycle regulatory proteins , such as cyclin B , and cyclin E , was up-regulated in crypts obtained from NIC-treated mice in our experiment ( data not shown ) . As NIC effectively expands the ISC population through the upregulated α7-nAChR and the formation of the YAP/TAZ-Notch loop , we speculate these factors to be good therapeutic targets for treating NIC-induced colon cancer . Activated YAP/TAZ , which act downstream of Hippo signaling , translocate to the nucleus and induce the gene expression of Notch receptors and Notch ligands , and thus , Notch is a mediator of YAP1-induced ISC expansion . Moreover , In the Lgr5CreERT2 Apcfl/fl mouse model , APC loss results in a constitutive stabilization of β-catenin , thus the hyperproliferation of ISCs by NIC treatment in this mouse model is likely beyond Wnt activation ( Figure 7 ) . Furthermore , we traced the signaling pathway in ISCs and detected that ISCs respond to NIC via α7-nAchR , PKC activation , and stimulation of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling ( Figure 5 ) . Similarly , we assessed the functional ability of ISCs and Paneth cells in terms of ex vivo organoid formation , which indicated a NIC-induced gain-of-function in ISCs but not in Paneth cells . These findings revealed the pivotal role of NIC as a stimulant of the cancer stem cell proliferation in intestinal tumors , and thus , explains colon cancer development in cigarette smokers . This previous report predicted that NIC activates the Hippo and Notch signaling pathway in Paneth cells rather than ISCs , because the α2β4-nAChR was mainly expressed in Paneth cells . Furthermore , YAP with TEADs enhances Jagged1-Notch1 signaling ; Notch1 promotes YAP stability through inhibited β-TrCP-mediated degradation and formation of a YAP1- jagged-1/Notch1-positive feedback loop in breast cancer cells . Consistent with this model , DBZ treatment inhibited Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in mice and prevented NIC-induced ISC expansion and transformation through Apc loss . The development of drugs that can block the α7-nAChR , Hippo-YAP/TAZ , and Notch signaling may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating colon cancers . This model is consistent with DBZ-induced suppression of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in ISCs from NIC-treated mice ( Figure 6B ) . Our data propose a model in which NIC enhances the self-renewal of ISCs via activated Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling ( Figure 5G ) . Moreover , mRNA analysis of NIC-treated organoids showed that the expression of YAP1/TAZ and Notch1/Dll1 was upregulated after treatment with NIC . Hence , we propose that the increase of ISC activity induced by NIC are not dependent on Paneth cells in functional assays . Moreover , PKC activity induces the translocation of ADAM-10 , which is implicated in the cleavage of Notch receptors , to the cell membrane of glioblastoma . Hence , we propose the possibility of NIC-induced activation of YAP and ADAM via PKC , leading to Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch activation and ISC expansion . Our data indicated that NIC increased the abundance and proliferation of ISCs , which may partly explain the increased rate of intestinal tumors in smokers . In conclusion , we demonstrated that NIC enhances the ISC population via α7-nAChR as well as Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling . Our ex vivo organoid assay revealed the role of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in NIC-induced ISC expansion . However , the risk of cancer associated with stem cell divisions is heavily influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors . The lifetime risk of various cancers is strongly correlated with frequency of stem cell divisions that maintain tissue homeostasis . Moreover
[METHODS] ",,884,93,None,"Nicotine is the main component of cigarette smoke . It is also known as a potent stimulant , but it is not known how it affects the development and progression of various diseases . One of the most common causes of cancer is the development of intestinal cancer , which is caused by a group of cells called intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) . These cells are made up of a protein called acetylcholine , and are responsible for the growth and development of many different types of cancers . However , it is unclear how these cells are able to grow and develop in the presence of nicotine . To address this question , Wang et al . used a mouse model to study the effects of nicotine on the growth of intestinal stem cell populations in mice . The experiments showed that , when a gene called Apc was deleted , the ISC population increased . This increased the number of ISC cells , resulting in the formation of tumors , while inhibiting Notch signaling . In addition , they found that a receptor called Notch binds to a specific protein called Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) and activates the Notch pathway . Interestingly , this signaling pathway was not activated in the paneth cells . Wang also found that dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) inhibited Notch activity in ISC populations , suggesting that this could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal cancers in cigarette smokers who smoke cigarettes . Furthermore , these findings suggest that BDZ can be used to treat cancers caused by smoking ."

[ABSTRACT] Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones : J-domain proteins ( JDPs ) and nucleotide exchange factors ( NEFs ) . The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surface , which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones . Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation , but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum . Here , we elucidate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing . Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif . We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation , determining its final efficacy . Thus , balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential . Hsp70 is a key cellular system counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation , associated with stress , ageing , and disease . Furthermore , we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The susceptibility to the NEF depends on the phase of the process and the composition of the Hsp70 system ( Figure 3A-D , Figure 3-figure supplement 1A ) , which may explain the discrepancies between different studies of Hsp110 's impact on disaggregation As well established , the most effective is sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 proportion to Hsp70 which corresponds with the physiological conditions , where the ratio between all cytoplasmic Hsp70 and Hsp110 paralogs involved in disaggregation ranges from approximately 10:1 . We propose that the local extraction of polypeptides by Hsp70-JDPB-Hsp110 , which penetrates the surface and takes apart amorphous aggregates , although not enough for full protein recovery , could successfully generate more manageable substrates for chaperones , as we demonstrated by applying the derepressed Hsp104 variant ( Figures 2A and 5 ) . While the s-shaped Ssa1-Sis1 binding to the aggregate results in the association of more Ssa1 than with Ydj1 ( Figure 1-figure supplement 2A ) , Hsp110 shortens the initial lag phase and boosts the binding efficacy , loading a thicker layer of Hsp70 molecules onto aggregates ( Figure 1B and C , Figure 1-figure supplement 2A ) , similarly as has been shown for amyloid fibrils . On the other hand , the final folding of a soluble substrate by Ssa1 relies much more on the class A JDP ( JDPA ) Ydj1 than on Sis1 , and not on Sse1 altogether ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1D ) , which is in line with previous reports that its human ortholog , Hsp105 inhibits luciferase folding . At high Hsp110 levels , the JDPB-Hsp70 interaction is very strongly affected , similarly as aggregate binding and disaggregation ( Figures 3A , B , D , 4A and B ) , suggesting that the proteins released by Hsp110 do not re-bind or that any subsequent binding is non-productive . 4-fold overexpression from two plasmids , shown by Kaimal et al. , was insufficient to complement the thermosensitive phenotype of sse1-200 sse2Δ , as it was six times too low to reach the level effective in disaggregation in vitro ( Figure 1-figure supplement 3A ) . We also gained insight into the biphasic impact of Hsp110 : with increasing Sse1 level , the stimulation is overshadowed by inhibition and the contribution of each trend depends on the phase of disaggregation and the composition of the disaggregating system , with a crucial role of the NEF 's affinity for Hsp70 . The results of the BLI experiments show that Hsp110 with class B JDP ( JDPB ) greatly increases Hsp70 aggregate binding ( Figure 1B and C , Figure 1-figure supplements 1E , F and 2A ) , which correlates with the final reactivation yield ( Figure 1A , Figure 1-figure supplement 1H ) , implying that the initiation phase determines the overall disaggregation efficiency . According to our data , the optimum , at which the stimulation and inhibition curves intersect , is shifted to higher levels : ( a ) during the initiation versus final protein folding ( Figure 3A and C ) , ( b ) with class B JDP , in comparison with class A ( Figure 3A , B , and D ) , ( c ) with Hsp104 , comparing with the system without the disaggregase ( Figure 3A , Figure 3-figure supplement 1A ) , and ( d ) for the human Hsp70 system , comparing with the yeast chaperones ( Figure 3A and B ) . Likewise , we observed remodelling of amorphous aggregates into smaller aggregated species , which resembles amyloid disassembly in terms of the dependence on the NEF activity of Hsp110 , the class B JDP and its interaction with the Hsp70 EEVD motif . An abundant association of Hsp70-JDPB with aggregate surface , although generating strong pulling effect to disentangle polypeptides , could also mask access of chaperones to the newly emerging sites adjacent to and buried beneath
[METHODS] ",,889,93,None,"Proteins are made up of many different types of molecules , including amino acids , proteins , and lipids . Each type of protein has a specific function , but it is not clear how it works . For example , the protein Hsp70 binds to a protein called amyloid fibrils , which are found on the surface of cells . This process is called disaggregation , whereby the protein is refolded into smaller pieces . However , this process can also occur in other cells , such as cells that have been damaged by stress , ageing , or disease . The protein H . spp . is a key component of the cell’s immune system . It is thought that the protein may be involved in a number of different processes , depending on how well it is able to disassemble the protein . One of these processes is called re-assembly . In the cell , a group of proteins called J-domain proteins ( JDPs ) and nucleotide exchange factors ( NEF ) are involved in disassembling the protein and releasing it . These proteins are known to help the protein to fold , so that it can be used as a substrate for other proteins . But it is unclear how these proteins work together . To investigate this , Wang et al . used a technique called X-ray crystallography to show that Hspinas , an enzyme that helps to break down proteins – called aggregates – into smaller particles . When the aggregates were disassembled , they were more easily rearranged , making them easier to recycle . As the aggregate was reassembled and the protein was ready to be recycled , it was difficult to"

[ABSTRACT] This work provides a framework for a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods , adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding wearable technology analytical pipelines , and supports clinical development of at-home gait assessments , with the potential to improve the ease , frequency , and depth of patient monitoring . After showing that digital insole-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional gait measurements , we next showed that a single stride of raw sensor time-series data could be accurately assigned to each subject , highlighting that individuals using digital insoles can be identified by their gait characteristics . However , clinical gait analysis relies on subjective visual observation of walking as objective gait analysis has not been possible within clinical settings due to the expensive equipment , large-scale facilities , and highly trained staff required . To achieve this , we constructed a machine learning model , trained on force plate data collected in participants with knee arthropathy and controls . In this work , we demonstrate how a digital insole measuring osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures yields similar results to the clinical gait-lab standard . This model was highly predictive of force plate data from a validation set ( area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [ auROC ] = 0 . Gait analysis is used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and monitor disease progression or intervention response . 90 ) and of a separate , independent digital insole dataset containing control and knee osteoarthritis subjects ( auROC = 0 . Relatively low-cost wearable digital insoles may offer a solution to these challenges . Gait is impaired in musculoskeletal conditions , such as knee arthropathy . 86 ; area under the precision-recall curve [ auPR ] = 0 . 83 ; auPR = 0 . 86 ) .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] In addition , the finding that our models can identify individual gait patterns suggests that data generated from a digital insole may have unforeseen future applications such as the potential to detect changes in individual gait patterns , which may provide better understanding of the impact of a therapeutic intervention for that individual . The study 's analytical approach , which focused solely on regular walking patterns and excluded outliers and irregular patterns in the insole gait data , may limit the comprehensiveness of the findings ; future research should aim to collect more diverse walking data per subject to include nonregular patterns . Additionally , the insoles are currently only capable of providing vGRF outcome measures , but medial and lateral GRF would also be useful outcomes for OA as these also relate to pain and OA severity . Ultimately , this work helps support the aspiration that digital technology may provide value in the healthcare delivery setting , aiding in accurate diagnosis or longitudinal monitoring of disease progression or of response to treatment . Only two repeat timepoints were used for subject-level classification in the knee OA group , but we demonstrated a modeling approach to reliably compute an individual 's gait consistency . Limitations of this analysis include the small sample size in the pilot study of controls , in addition to the fact that subjects in this study were not demographically and clinically matched with the OA study . To identify disease signatures , we built an ML model using only data from force plates , the clinical standard , and analyzing data from a digital insole , we showed comparable disease classification . Technology developments would be required to develop a wearable system that would be capable of capturing comprehensive GRFs during walking in OA and should be an area of future research . Further , the OA study did not control for knee-only OA on one or both joints , thus making this population heterogeneous and limiting generalizability . This platform-agnostic analysis demonstrates that ML approaches can help support and validate digital biomarkers and may yield digital endpoints of clinical utility . This work outlines a framework for an integrated analysis of digital insole data to answer clinical and research questions relevant to digital biomarker development . In addition , full analytical validation of the digital insoles was not possible as force plate and insole data was not collected simultaneously , and therefore evaluation of criterion and concurrent validity was not possible . While this study only looked at knee arthropathies , future work will be focused on a broader set of gait-affecting diseases . Despite this , we were able to show favorable classification performance for these control subjects relative to their force plate counterparts . In the future , this would ideally be performed on data collected at more than two timepoints . The study design also did not specifically account for familiarization with the insoles . Future work should help determine gait outcome measures for accuracy and error .

To achieve this , researchers need to be able to use a device called a digital insole to measure gait . This device can be used to track the movement patterns of people with a variety of musculoskeletal conditions , such as knee arthropathy . The insoles are made from a material called force plate , which is made from the skin of the foot . When the insole is worn , the force plate is placed on the foot and the foot is then pushed into the shoe . These forces are then measured using a computer program called machine learning . Machine learning algorithms can be applied to a wide range of subjects , including people with knee , hip , or ankle arthritis . In the future , these algorithms will be used in clinical trials , where they can help to predict the outcome of treatment .

We further purified the major matrix component , the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO . Local application of Clarix Flo ( FLO ) , a human amniotic membrane ( AM ) product , attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice . Collectively , our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain . This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways . Moreover , we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 . Therefore , there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain . HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition . Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death . Pain after surgery causes significant suffering .

[DISCUSSION] It induced an acute cytoskeleton rearrangement and inhibition of INav and HVA-Ica currents in a CD44-dependent manner , making it a promising non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain . Nevertheless , translation of preclinical findings into clinical treatments is complex and often challenging due to species differences and the intricate nature of pain etiology in patients . Our findings provide an important rational for future clinical trials to validate the utility of FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 for post-surgical pain control . Our study suggests that human birth tissue products may be deployed as a viable biologic to treat post-surgical pain . We further identified HC-HA/PTX3 as the primary bioactive component responsible for pain inhibition .

[ABSTRACT] We reasoned this by less correlation between the actual color and the gene expressions that directly define the level of pigmentation , from which we hypothesized the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition not strongly indicating the functional characteristics of the RPE . To know whether their color in appearance is correlated with the function of the RPE , we analyzed the color intensities of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells ( iPSC-RPE ) together with the gene expression profile at the single-cell level . For this purpose , we utilized our recent invention , Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System ( ALPS ) , which enabled photographing each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell . While our iPSC-RPE were categorized into four clusters by gene expression , the color intensity of iPSC-RPE did not project any specific gene expression profiles . Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells show heterogeneous levels of pigmentation when cultured in vitro .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] When stem cell-derived RPE cells are cultured in vitro , they are apparently not pigmented at sparse density , probably due to dilution amongst daughter cells or secretion of melanin by the fusion of melanosome membrane to the plasma membrane as proposed in melanocytes , but they become pigmented when they form a confluent monolayer , which is a reversible effect as the dynamics of pigmentation repeats when they are re-plated at a sparse density and become confluent again ( Figure 3-figure supplement 1 ) . In this study , we showed the degree of pigmentation of in vitro cultured iPSC-RPE cells did not project specific gene ontological clusters , although it correlated to some extent with the expressions of functional genes of the RPE , such as complement- and lysosome-related genes . For example , bone marrow-derived RPE cells that are poorly pigmented in vitro become highly pigmented when transplanted , as well as our iPSC-RPE cells that are not pigmented when prepared but actually become heavily pigmented after engrafted , suggest the significance of environmental niche for melanogenesis . On the other hand , primary culture of fetal-derived RPE cells , although less pigmented initially , becomes heavily pigmented when confluent monolayers are formed , reflecting the nature of melanosomes produced during a limited time window of embryogenesis . More importantly , human embryonic stem cell ( ESC ) - or iPSC-derived RPE cells exhibit pigmentation when they become confluent suggesting these cells may retain or have been reprogrammed to gain the characteristics of fetal RPE cells . Without the exposure to pathogens or photoreceptor outer segments , in vitro pigmentation of iPSC-RPE cells could be somewhat a spontaneous but not a necessary sign to show they are prone to execute their protective function . Interestingly , the pigmentation level of Lonza-RPE cells correlated with their gene expression profile ( Figure 2D ) , which may reflect the developmental process of RPE that gains protective function , including melanogenesis , during embryogenesis . Our iPSC-RPE formed different clusters from Lonza-RPE by single-cell transcriptome analysis , which was consistent with our previous study showing the gene expression pattern of our iPSC-RPE was slightly different from Lonza-RPE , although it was closer than human RPE cell-line ARPE19 , . Although it was weak , the correlation of complement- and lysosome-related genes to the color shown in the present study , suggests the darker RPE cells may be prone to facilitate these functions . Several attempts were made to re-pigment RPE cells by supplying them with melanosomes isolated from ex vivo RPE cells or more recently with artificial melanin-like nanoparticles . Indeed , it has been shown that in vitro pigmentations of RPE cells are enhanced by extracellular matrix or even more intriguingly by phagocytosis of rod outer segments . The material of the dark pigments , melanin , is conserved from bacteria to mammals , with diverse protective functions against damaging ultraviolet rays , free radicals , or toxins . In fact , there are several lines of evidence implying in vitro pigmentation of stem cell-derived RPE cells may not necessarily reflect their levels of functional maturation . To protect the photoreceptors from pathogens in this immune suppressive environment , RPE has an immune cell-like aspect with the capability of complement activation and phagocytosis . Unlike skin melanin that is constantly synthesized in epidermal melanocytes , melanin in RPE cells decreases with age , making the retina vulnerable with less protection by the RPE . In the eye , melanosomes are located in RPE cells and choroidal melanocytes , where they shield the photoreceptor to reduce backscattered light and remove free radicals . From this aspect , ESC- or iPSC-derived RPE cells may be more plastic , retaining immature profiles although apparently being pigmented spontaneously . Eye , as well as brain and testis , is an immune privilege organ , where inflammation by the immune system is minimized . This again suggests the involvement of extracellular cues for pigmentation , besides the intrinsic characteristics of
[METHODS] ",,871,92,None,"Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells are a group of cells in the retina that produce a pigment called melanin . The pigment is produced by a small group of red blood cells called reticulum , which are found in the eye . These cells are known as pigment epithelial cells , and they are thought to be responsible for protecting the retina from damage . However , it is not clear how the pigment is formed . In the retina , the pigment epithelia is made up of two types of cells called pigment cells . One type is called iPSC-RPE . This type of cells are called stem cell-derived RPE cells and are able to grow in vitro , but it is unclear how this type of RPE is made .

They found that the color of these cells was not correlated with the gene expression profiles of each cell , suggesting that pigmentation is a temporal condition , not a specific characteristic of the RPE cell .

[ABSTRACT] MarmoAAP addresses the limitations of traditional behavioral research methods by enabling high-throughput , detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings , allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting . This new apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations , paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism . In recent years , the field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms . The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) , due to its small size , prosocial nature , and genetic proximity to humans , has emerged as a pivotal model toward this effort . To address this critical gap , we developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling ( MarmoAAP ) , a novel behavioral apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets . We also highlight the flexibility of MarmoAAP in task parameter manipulation which accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual animal capabilities . However , traditional research methodologies often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors . MarmoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes . Furthermore , MarmoAAP provides a platform to perform investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] One key modification would involve adjusting the size of the servo motor and the lever , as the current setup is tailored to small animals like marmosets , which can be trained to exert a pulling force of approximately 500-600 g. For larger animals , incorporating a larger motor capable of exerting greater force , along with more durable parts , would be recommended . This task design strikes a pivotal balance between traditional naturalistic animal behavior studies , which benefit from a high degree of naturalism but often suffer from low behavioral resolution and limited trial counts , and conventional lab studies , which are highly controlled but lack natural ethological relevance . While our study demonstrates a considerable increase in trial throughput using the automated apparatus , with marmosets completing an average of 146 trials per 20 min session , it is important to note that not all of these trials result in successful outcomes . Additionally , there are challenges associated with sustaining motivation over longer periods , particularly in the context of the Mutual Cooperation task which requires not just one , but two animals to be simultaneously motivated and engaged for the same duration . As we move forward , this paradigm not only serves as a platform for in-depth investigations into marmoset social dynamics but also holds the promise of extending our understanding of cognitive processes and neural mechanisms across a variety of complex behaviors . For future studies , researchers might consider implementing more controlled and stringent food and water restrictions , in line with established protocols , to increase the marmosets ' motivation by ensuring they are sufficiently hungry or thirsty during task sessions . This approach addresses the limitations of paradigms that fall short of faithfully capturing the intricacies of social interactions , emphasizing the importance of a more ecologically valid framework for advancing our understanding of the neural dynamics that underpin fundamental aspects of primate social brain functions . Our findings also showcase that the detailed behavioral data outputs from the apparatus , including millisecond-level timestamps for lever pulls and reward deliveries , enable us to quantitatively assess marmosets ' learning and performance on this task . The scientific community can leverage this paradigm to explore a myriad of cognitive processes , from observational learning to executive function , laying the groundwork for comprehensive insights into the neural mechanisms of complex behaviors in nonhuman primates . While our primary focus was on the design , development , and validation of the apparatus and methods , we recognize the potential for further optimization in these areas to maximize the efficacy of the paradigm for neurophysiological and cognitive experiments . Utilizing video recordings obtained during the task , we showcased the application of automated behavioral marking tools , such as DLC2 , to probe the interplay between behavioral dynamics-particularly gaze behaviors-and performance on the cooperative task . Coordinating motivation between two animals is inherently more challenging than motivating a single subject , as both must be willing to work at the same time and for the same length of time to achieve successful cooperation . This adaptability not only expedites the animal training process but also allows for a nuanced exploration of the intricate dimensions of cooperative behaviors , ensuring that experimental conditions closely align with research objectives . We show that marmosets exhibit a rapid acquisition of proficiency in the lever-pulling action and demonstrate their capacity to grasp more complex task contingencies , such as the cooperative pulling task highlighted in this study . This increased trial throughput is of critical importance for investigations of the neural mechanisms underlying these social behaviors , ensuring the acquisition of a robust dataset for comprehensive analyses of neural activity during naturalistic behavioral settings .

[ABSTRACT] Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology , intelligence , educational attainment , autism , and schizophrenia . Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions . Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific , with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation . In our murine model , a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation . We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE ) resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans . DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation . Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates . Alcohol consumption in pregnancy can affect genome regulation in the developing offspring but results have been contradictory .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] It is remarkable that some associations identified in our murine model of early moderate exposure were recapitulated in human subjects with FASD despite species and biosample differences , suggesting that at least some DNA methylation changes are stable over time . In conclusion , this study demonstrates that early moderate PAE can disturb fetal genome regulation in mice and humans and supports current public health advice that alcohol consumption during pregnancy , even at low doses , may be harmful . Notably , PEX12 is associated with Zellweger syndrome , which is a rare peroxisome biogenesis disorder ( the most severe variant of peroxisome biogenesis disorder spectrum ) , characterised by neuronal migration defects in the brain , dysmorphic craniofacial features , profound hypotonia , neonatal seizures , and liver dysfunction . Although a plausible alternative explanation is that some of the PAE regions were not reproduced in the set of mice given the folate diet , our data are consistent with preclinical studies of choline supplementation in rodent models . On the balance of this , we speculate duration of exposure , dose , and other tissue-related factors all likely influence the extent to which genome regulation is perturbed and manifests as differences in DNA methylation . Although our findings should be interpreted with caution , they collectively support the notion that alcohol-induced perturbation of epigenetic regulation may occur , at least in part , through disruption of the one-carbon metabolism . Caveats of our study design include a limited ability to determine the contribution of specific cell types within tissues to the methylation differences observed , and we did not assess markers of brain or liver physiology . Notably the effect size for replicated regions were strikingly smaller in blood samples from subjects with FASD suggesting the dose and duration of exposure may need to exceed a high threshold to survive reprogramming in the blood . In this study , we found that moderate early ( first trimester ) PAE was sufficient to induce site-specific differences to DNA methylation in newborn pups without causing overt behavioural outcomes in adult mice . For example , three genes that were validated in the Lussier et al. , 2018 cohort are zinc finger proteins ( RP9 , PEX12 , and ZNF823 ) that play an important role in fetal gene regulation . The most encouraging aspect of this relates to the potential utility for evidence-informed recommendations for dietary advice or supplementation , particularly in population groups with limited access to antenatal care or healthy food choices . Although global levels of DNA methylation were not significantly different with PAE , regional analysis demonstrated widespread effects characterised predominantly by lower DNA methylation with PAE , mostly at non-coding regions of the genome . Previous rodent and human studies have identified DNA methylation differences with PAE in imprinted regions such as the Igf2/H19 locus , although results are not entirely consistent . In our model , alcohol effects on DNA methylation were predominantly tissue-specific , with only two genomic regions and four genes that were similarly affected in both liver and brain . Both the human replication studies and the candidate gene analysis provide validity to our model for recapitulating some of the genomic disturbances reported in patients with clinical FASD . Although the trajectories of alcohol consumption were not statistically different between groups , this introduces more variability into alcohol exposure patterns , and might impact offspring methylation data . We also performed WGBS representing the gold standard in DNA methylation analysis , which to our knowledge has not been performed before in the context of murine PAE studies . In the candidate gene analysis we replicated previously published reports of decreased DNA methylation within Peg3 and KvDMR1 from South African children with FAS . Indeed , most of the observed effects were tissue-specific , with more perturbations to the epigenome observable in liver tissue ,
[METHODS] ",,896,93,None,"Alcohol is a harmful substance that can affect the development of a child . It can also affect the brain , liver , and other organs , including the brain and liver . Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can affect genes that are important for developing children , such as autism , schizophrenia , or autism . However , it is not clear how alcohol affects genes in the developing offspring . In this study , researchers used a mouse model to study how alcohol can affect DNA methylation in newborn pups . The mice were fed a diet high in folate and choline , which protects them from some of the harmful effects of early moderate prenatal alcohol exposure . Previous studies have shown that early moderate alcohol exposure can affect gene reprogramming in the fetal brain . But the results have been contradictory . For example , in humans , the mice were exposed to a low dose of alcohol in the first trimester of pregnancy , but this was not the case in mice with FASD . Now , Lussier et al . have used mice that were given a high dose of folate , a protein that is found in the brain of newborns and in the liver of adult mice . These mice were then exposed to alcohol for a short period of time before they were born . This allowed them to develop a better understanding of how alcohol influences genes in their developing babies . Using a genetically relevant mouse model , they found that the levels of methylated DNA in the newborns were significantly different from those in the adult littermates . Some of the changes in the DNA in these mice were likely to be caused by a mutation in a gene called PEX12 . Further experiments showed that the mice had a lower level of phenotypic changes compared"

[ABSTRACT] Quantitative models and their exploratory simulations led us to find that ( 1 ) changing cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3 , ( 2 ) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells , and ( 3 ) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides , which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs , are enriched within 'pUG zones ' matching the dsRNA . In this network , the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10 , the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16 , and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene , but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene , where only the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing . Here , we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism . Since double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) is effective for silencing a wide variety of genes , all genes are typically considered equivalent targets for such RNA interference ( RNAi ) . Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs . Yet , loss of some regulators of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can selectively impair the silencing of some genes .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Therefore , we propose that the production of 22G RNAs in response to the addition of dsRNA occurs as follows : ( 1 ) non-processive RdRPs make a heterogenous mixture of short RNAs , ( 2 ) 2° Argonautes bind the 5′ end of these pre-secondary siRNA , and ( 3 ) RDE-10 and/or associated protein ( s ) remove excess 3′ sequence to generate 22-nt siRNAs that are effectively retained by the mature siRNA-Argonaute complex . Current models for the production of 26G RNAs propose that the RdRP RRF-3 transcribes long antisense RNA from internal C nucleotides on template mRNA , the phosphatase PIR-1 converts the 5′ triphosphate of the RdRP product into 5′ mono phosphate , the template is then trimmed by the 3′-5′ exonuclease ERI-1 to generate a blunt-ended dsRNA , which is then cleaved by DCR-1 to generate the mature 26G RNAs that are bound by the Argonaute ERGO-1 . When a gene with a high threshold for silencing is targeted , it could rely on multiple regulators that act in parallel to contribute to silencing ( e. g. , bli-1 in this study ) , making resistance through the mutation of any one regulator more likely and necessitating another round of drug development . The various values of τkd that are possible for each tkd ( Figure 4D ) cautions against using a rapid onset of silencing ( low τkd ) as the sole indicator of promise during early stages of drug development when long-term effects of a drug are often not evaluated in the interest of expedience . The detection of long pUG RNAs with no detectable shorter pUG RNAs upstream of sequences matching the dsRNA ( Figure 6C ) argues against the 3′ trimming of mRNA templates to generate shorter RNAs that then get pUGylated to become stabilized templates for RdRPs and against pUG RNA generation driven by successive rounds of 22G RNA production in somatic cells . RDE-10 has a conserved Maelstrom domain that shares homology with the DnaQ-H 3′-5′ exonuclease family and the mutation we identified as disrupting silencing by dsRNA ( Figure 1D ) alters a residue located near the highly conserved ECHC zinc-binding motif ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1C ) . In contrast , genes with a lower threshold may not require all the regulators for silencing ( e. g. , unc-22 in this study ) , making them ideal targets that remain silenced despite single mutations in many regulators of RNAi ( e. g. , RDE-10 , MUT-16 , or NRDE-3 in this study ) . Since Argonautes bind the 5′ end of small RNAs and can associate with RNAs of different lengths , we suggest a model whereby RDE-10 and downstream Argonautes together play a role in the maturation of 22-nt siRNAs from longer RdRP products . In contrast , since the mRNA is used as a template to generate the abundant secondary small RNAs in C. elegans or additional dsRNAs in other systems , the silencing of different mRNAs could diverge through the selective recruitment of different collections of regulators . Strikingly , changing the 3′cis-regulatory sequences of bli-1 also made its silencing largely independent of NRDE-3 ( Figure 5B ) , providing direct evidence for the prior regulation of a gene dictating the genetic requirements for silencing in response to dsRNA . Despite this potential use of an intersecting network for silencing all somatic genes , different genes could critically depend on different regulators because of differences in their mRNA metabolism and/or subcellular localization ( summarized as threshold differences in Figure 2 ) . The fact that any two of MUT-16 , NRDE-3 , and RDE-10 - three structurally and functionally different proteins - are required for unc-22 silencing suggests that each of these proteins could be contributing to silencing of any RNAi target . Since a dsRNA drug can be
[METHODS] ",,903,94,None,"Many genes have been linked to different diseases , including cancer , heart disease and diabetes . However , some genes are also linked to other diseases . For example , genes that are linked to cancer can be spliced into a protein called double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) , which is produced by a group of enzymes called the Argonaute protein . This protein is a key regulator of the production of RNA molecules , but it is not known how this process works . In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , the gene that controls gene expression is regulated by two different proteins: the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10 and the argonautes protein NRDE-3 . These proteins are involved in a number of processes that are important for gene expression . One of these is the cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides , a process that makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs . The Argonauates protein , however , is not involved in this process . Instead , it is involved in the amplification of a specific gene , called the gene for which dSRNA is produced . A new protein called RDE-1 is required for this process to work properly , and it is thought that this protein could also be involved in other processes that help to control gene expression in animals . Now , Wang et al . have investigated how a network of regulators that control gene activity in the organism can be used to determine whether a gene can be targeted by an RNA interference ( RNAi ) pathway . To do this , they used a computer simulation to study the interactions between the proteins"

[ABSTRACT] We aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality , and determine the best predictors of death , utilizing whole-blood RNA sequencing from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM , 295 pulmonary tuberculosis ( PTB ) , and 30 healthy controls . These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB , highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death , offering insights for potential therapeutic targets alongside a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes . Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis , we identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality , with a consensus analysis revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals . Mortality and morbidity from tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) are common , primarily due to inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection , yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood . We employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death , then logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose best predictors . Among HIV-positive individuals , mortality associated with increased angiogenesis , while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization . Four hub genes-MCEMP1 , NELL2 , ZNF354C , and CD4-were strong TBM mortality predictors . Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our own earlier studies have also suggest a role for neutrophils in TBM pathogenesis , with high pretreatment CSF bacterial loads being correlated with high neutrophil numbers in both CSF and blood and more frequent new neurological events or paradoxical inflammatory complications . Whilst there appeared to be many common pathways involved in TBM mortality in HIV-positive and negative individuals , there were differences : death was associated with increased expression of angiogenesis genes in HIV-positive adults , and with TNF signaling and down regulated extracellular matrix organization in HIV-negative adults . This study investigated the pathways associated with death from TBM at a whole-genome transcriptome level in whole blood , characterizing a global dysregulation in immune responses , including inflammation , and revealing specific functional pathways and hub genes involved in TBM and the mechanisms leading to death . Therefore , the differences in gene expression associated with TBM mortality in the current study - with angiogenesis activation linked to HIV-positive TBM mortality only , for example - may provide an explanation for the poor response and offer alternative therapeutic strategies . Studies have shown a decreased memory B cell proportion , and lower levels of IgG , IgM antibodies and Fcγ receptors binding capacity in plasma in those with active lung TB compared to those with latent TB or healthy volunteers . The observed association between TBM mortality and decreased transcriptional responses in B cell activation and B cell receptor signaling pathways suggest an unanticipated role for B cells and humoral immunity in TBM pathogenesis that needs further investigation . A range of immune responses , involving in inflammation , cytokines , interferon , inflammasome and neutrophil signaling pathways , were activated in both PTB and TBM , but with significantly greater activation in HIV-positive TBM than HIV-negative TBM . Furthermore , we have identified similarities and differences in the inflammatory response associated with TBM in HIV-positive and negative adults , which may explain the different therapeutic effects of adjunctive corticosteroid treatment . We also revealed a four-gene host response signature in blood that might represent a novel biomarker for defining those at highest risk of death , regardless of their HIV status . In general , previous studies investigating TBM pathogenesis have been small , testing for relatively small numbers of selected genes or molecules , and have been unable to take an unbiased and broader view of the inflammatory response . A reduction of activities in both T cell and B cell receptor signaling pathways in death were identified , independent of over-expression of neutrophil-mediated immune responses , indicating that multiple functional pathways influence TBM mortality . Previous studies have shown lower numbers of T cells , reduced ability to respond to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens or reduced expression of activation markers and cytokine production in TBM compared to PTB and healthy individuals . Previous blood transcriptome studies have shown that IFN-inducible neutrophil-driven transcripts were over-expressed in blood neutrophils from active TB patients compared to those with latent TB . However , increased transcripts in some specific immunity pathways , including TNF signaling , Toll-like receptor , NF-kappa B and neutrophil extracellular trap formation , were associated with TBM mortality . Taken together with previous studies , our findings support an important role for over-activation of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses in TBM pathogenesis and its lethal complications . This finding aligns with our previous data showing a dysregulated hyper-inflammation in HIV-associated TBM , with significantly higher CSF cytokine concentrations than in those without HIV infection . Recent studies have shown that angiogenesis is induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection , which then contributes to inflammation , tissue damage and is correlated with disease severity . We found blood transcriptional responses of T cells and B cells were under-expressed in those who died from TBM , indicating an impairment in adaptive immunity in fatal disease . These

It is caused by a bacterial infection that causes the lungs to become infected with the bacteria . The lungs are also contaminated with bacteria that can infect the body . TBM is mainly caused by an inflammatory response , but it is not clear how the immune system responds to the infection . In some cases , TBM can lead to death . However , the underlying mechanisms of TBM are not well understood . For example , it is thought that TBM causes an inflammation response in the blood , causing the blood to become more inflamed . To investigate this , Wang et al . used whole-blood RNA sequencing to identify genes and pathways that are associated with TBM mortality . This revealed that the immune response to TBM has a similar effect to that of PTB , and that these genes are more likely to be involved in TBM death than in HIV-positive or HIV-negative individuals . These findings suggest that the TBM immune response is more important for TBM survival than for other diseases , such as pulmonary tuberculose , as well as other diseases such as cancer .

[ABSTRACT] Side-by-side comparisons of all antibodies against each target , obtained from multiple commercial partners , have demonstrated that : ( i ) more than 50 % of all antibodies failed in one or more applications , ( ii ) yet , ~50-75 % of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody , depending on application , suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant ; and ( iii ) recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies . It is commonly understood that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets , but information on the scope of the problem remains largely anecdotal , and as such , feasibility of the goal of at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in a proteome can not be assessed . This first study helps demonstrate the scale of the antibody specificity problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome ; mine the existing commercial antibody repertoire , and use the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts . Focusing on antibodies for human proteins , we have scaled a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins . Encouragingly , more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers , and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market . The hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles , which should raise alarm . Antibodies are critical reagents to detect and characterize proteins .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Our set of 65 funder-designated proteins is an unbiased sample , representative of the heterogeneity of knowledge of the human proteome ; a search of the NIH protein database revealed that 15 proteins ( 23 % of our protein sample ) are well studied with more than 500 publications and 50 proteins ( 77 % of our protein sample ) have corresponding publications ranging from 37 to 498 ( Figure 1-source data 1 ) . Although we observed that there are more commercial antibodies available for the best-studied proteins ( Figure 1-source data 1 ) , an encouraging result of our work is that more than half of our protein targets are covered by well-performing , renewable antibodies for WB , IP and IF - including both well characterized and more poorly studied proteins . Given that it is difficult to imagine a characterization pipeline dependent on IF , we suggest that using KO ( or knockdown in the case of an essential gene ) strategies to screen antibodies for the intended application will provide the most effective approach to identify selective antibodies . Our studies provide an unbiased and scalable analytical framework for the representation and comparison of antibody performance , an estimate of the coverage of human proteins with renewable antibodies , an assessment of the scientific value of common antibody characterization methods , and they inform a strategy to identify renewable antibodies for all human proteins . Thus , independent antibody characterization with openly published data , funded by various global organizations , is an important , if not essential , initiative that is certain to save large amounts of money and increase the quality and reproducibility of the literature . While recombinant antibodies may rely on the use of animals for the initiation of an antibody generation program , animal-free in vitro molecular strategies are also used for production , and to generate new batches of these antibodies . This situation has also been acknowledged by the EU Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing and a lack of understanding in the use of recombinant methods has been suggested by authors of a recent correspondence to the editors of Nature Biotechnology . Extrapolation of our findings to the human proteome would suggest that it might be possible to identify well-performing renewable reagents for half the human proteome , including poorly characterized proteins , simply by mining commercial collections . Overall , this project provides the global life sciences community with a tremendous resource for the study of human proteins and will result in significant improvements in rigour and reproducibility in antibody-based assays and scientific discovery . The search term 'ycharos ' will return all the currently available antibodies that have been characterized and searching for the target or the catalogue number of the antibody in any of these portals will also bring back the YCharOs information . Currently , one of the main barriers to large-scale production of high-quality antibodies is the lack of availability of KO lines derived from cells that express detectable levels of each human protein . In our set of 65 proteins , we found that an average of ~12 papers per protein included use of an antibody that failed to recognize the intended protein target using our protocols . For example , while leading antibody manufacturers are converting top-cited polyclonal antibodies into recombinant antibodies and removing underperforming antibodies from their catalogues , polyclonals remain the most purchased . At a minimum , removal of these poorly performing products from the market will have significant impact in that hundreds of published papers report the use of such antibodies . Our approach , developed in collaboration with manufacturers , and

[ABSTRACT] Together , these LexA and QF system vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal . Focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns , we generated a set of more than 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in and verified their tissue specificity in larvae . Finally , using new compatible shRNA vectors , we evaluated both LexA and QF systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a library of such RNAi fly lines as a community resource . Following successful integration of this construct into the fly genome , FLP/FRT recombination is used to isolate fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD . The ability to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal is emerging as a major need , especially in the context of inter-organ communication studies . This type of study is made possible by technologies combining the GAL4/UAS and a second binary expression system such as the LexA system or QF system . Here , we describe a resource of reagents that facilitate combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary system in various Drosophila tissues . We also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] There have been previous efforts to make LexA and QF tools , but the availability of LexA-GAD and QF2 tissue-specific fly stocks remains a major resource gap , preventing the average fly researcher from performing the type of multi-tissue manipulations that are essential to advance the study of organ and tissue communication . Our collection of T2A-LexA-GAD and T2A-QF2 and double driver vectors can be easily adapted to target any gene for CRISPR knock-in , with a high probability that the resulting line will accurately reflect the expression of the endogenous locus . Further , we expect that there will also be differences between the expression pattern of corresponding GAL4 and the LexA-GAD/QF lines , as the latter were made by knock-in , while the former are often enhancer traps . For example , we identified the uncharacterized genes CG9458 and CG17560 , as highly oenocyte-specific based on the Fly Cell Atlas Single-cell transcriptome , and the T2A-LexA-GAD and T2A-QF2 knock-ins in these genes were indeed restricted to this tissue . In summary , we have generated a set of stocks , vectors , and protocols that when combined with the wide array of GAL4 lines will greatly expand the ability of Drosophila researchers to modulate gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously . While we had no difficulty obtaining knock-ins for both types of activators , we did observe that for some target genes , the T2A-QF2 was only active in a subset of the expected gene expression pattern . We have therefore prioritized Cre-Lox removal of the 3XP3-RFP cassette from our knock-in stocks , and advise that users of the plasmids described here likewise remove the marker , following successful knock-in . These efforts will benefit from the emergence of scRNAseq datasets , which can be used to identify target genes with highly organ or tissue-specific gene expression patterns . When we compared the knockdown efficiency of shRNAs targeting forked and ebony and , we found that the TRiP 13XLexAop vector was more effective than the 5XQUAS vector , although both were able to induce knockdown . Based on these results , the TRiP is currently generating a set of ~100 LexAop shRNA lines encompassing the genes targeted by the most commonly ordered UAS shRNA stocks at the BDSC . In our hands , the drop-in cloning strategy is particularly effective , as the cloning success rate is 100 % , requires little troubleshooting , has a very high knock-in rate , and only costs ~ $ 100 to synthesize the construct . However , recent innovations in multi-module vectors and multiplexed drug-based genetics allow researchers to more efficiently generate UAS/QUAS/lexAop transgenic fly strains . The collection of T2A-LexA-GAD and T2A-QF2 drivers described here is unique in that it is the first to focus on covering the major organ systems of the fly . However , based on our larval mounts and dissections , the stocks generated in this paper are highly specific to the expression pattern of the targeted genes . The specificity achieved with this approach can also be seen in recent efforts to build collections of gene-specific T2A-Split-GAL4 and T2A-GAL4 insertions . Perhaps due to interaction between the 3XP3 promoter and the regulatory regions of the target gene , we occasionally saw misexpression of the LexA-GAD/QF2 in the 3XP3 domain . Our protocol for generating these stocks is straightforward and can be easily adapted to produce driver lines for other fly tissues . Additionally , we found that the driver expression in the gut-specific genes , mex1 and Myo31Df , differed between the LexA-GAD and QF2 transformants . Alternatively , differences in the LexA-GAD and QF2 sequences , and sequence length , could impact the function of nearby gene regulatory regions . There remains an unmet need for a single vector that would allow for UAS/LexAop/QUAS control of different shRNAs .
[METHODS] ",,905,94,None,"During the development of a new cell , an organism must communicate with other cells in order to survive . This is achieved by a process called gene expression . In this process , a protein called GAL4 is produced , which is a transcription factor that can be activated or repressed in different tissues in the same animal . The GAL-4 protein is regulated by two genes , LexA and QF . These two genes are known as LexA-GAD , and are involved in the production of many proteins . However , it is not clear how these two genes interact with each other . For example , some genes are found in the fly’s skin , while others are found inside the body . To study how these genes interact , researchers need to understand how they work . One way to do this is by using a technique called RNAi . RNA is made up of RNA molecules called reagents . A protein called LexA can be used to repress the expression of two genes in different tissue types , such as the liver , the kidney , or the intestine . It can also be used as a template to create a clone of the RNA in a fly .

[ABSTRACT] We show in mice that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro . Interruption of C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or by deletion of Nrxn3 in the dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b as well as C1ql2 mutant phenotype . Together , this study identifies a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function . Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses . Furthermore , we demonstrate C1ql2 to exert its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3 , Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) . The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction . Thus , our findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction . The underlying molecular mechanisms , however , remained unclear .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] While a modest displacement of SV might fail to noticeably influence synaptic transmission due to the low initial Pr at MFS , causing only a fraction of release-ready vesicles to be initially released , the reduction in synapse numbers might indeed be expected to reflect in the input-output relationship . We have previously shown that conditional ablation of Bcl11b in the adult hippocampus leads to structural and functional changes of MFS characterized by an overall reduction in synapse numbers , loss of bouton complexity , misdistribution of SV as well as loss of MF-LTP . Moreover , the existence of such cell-type-specific signaling modules reveals how a fundamental transcription factor with diverse functions such as Bcl11b can be implicated in the pathogenesis of brain disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction . Using shRNA-mediated selective KD of C1ql2 in DGN as well as rescue of the Bcl11b mutation by the reintroduction of C1ql2 into mutant DGN , we observed a novel , presynaptic function for C1ql2 in the recruitment of SV and the expression of LTP in MFS . Here , we found that reintroduction of the synaptic organizer protein C1ql2 , which is a direct transcriptional target of Bcl11b and is downregulated in Bcl11b mutant DGN , was able to rescue major part of the Bcl11b mutant phenotype at the MFS . Restoring C1ql2 expression in Bcl11b cKO DGN led to a complete rescue of the SV distribution and docking , as well as LTP at the MFS , while synapse numbers and ultrastructural complexity of boutons remained unchanged . We can not exclude , however , that the expression of a mutant C1ql2 variant created an additional gain-of-function effect that circumvented SV recruitment and allowed the rescue of MF-LTP in our experimental system . It might be that synapses that are preferentially eliminated in Bcl11b mutants are predominantly silent or have weak coupling strength , such that their loss has only a minimal effect on synaptic transmission . Together , our results suggest Bcl11b to be an important synaptic regulator that controls the structure and function of adult MFS through both C1ql2-dependent , as well as -independent transcriptional programs . In the present study , mossy fiber responses were specifically identified by testing for frequency facilitation and sensitivity to mGluR antagonists , whereas in the previous study , this purification was not done . Neurexin mRNAs are subjected to extensive alternative splicing that leads to the expression of thousands of isoforms with differential expression patterns that act in a type-specific manner on synaptic functions . MF-LTP relies on presynaptic mechanisms and is mediated by the second messenger cAMP , which is produced by AC in response to Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and KARs . Our findings on the role of Nrxn3 isoforms containing SS525b in the recruitment of SV at the MFS through interaction with C1ql2 add to the understanding of the synapse-specific mechanisms of action of Nrxns . There is emerging evidence that the zinc finger transcription factor Bcl11b is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental as well as neuropsychiatric disorders that are frequently associated with synaptic dysfunction . Recent studies have shown that the increase in Pr involves the recruitment of new AZ and an increase in the number of docked and tethered vesicles , corresponding to the readily releasable pool of SV . In the present study , we uncover a novel C1ql2-dependent regulatory pathway through which Bcl11b controls the structural as well as functional integrity of hippocampal MFS in adult mice . Furthermore , clustering of vGlut1 by C1ql2-secreting HEK293 cells was reduced in neurons harboring a pan-neurexin mutation , a phenotype that was rescued by the selective reintroduction of Nrxn3α ( 25b+ ) . In our study , we show that neither loss of C1ql2 nor overexpression of C1ql2 affects the number of MFS , supporting the notion that synaptic organizers have synapse-specific functions . This raises the possibility that C1ql2 can influence MF-LTP through additional , yet uncharacterized
[METHODS] ",,879,92,None,"Neurons in the brain are made up of a network of neurons called synapses . These connect to each other by a process called synaptic vesicles , which are known as synapses . When a neuron receives a signal from another neuron , the sxypse carries the signal to the next neuron and then carries it back to the cell . This process is known as synaptogenesis , and it has been linked to a number of disorders , including autism , schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease . However , it is not clear how the synaptome is formed , how it is used and how it interacts with other cells . To investigate this , Wang et al . used a mouse model to study the function of the transcription factor Bcl11b .

[ABSTRACT] We further studied the first mode of Sfp1 activity and found that , following promoter binding , Sfp1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration , manifested by dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking . We show that Sfp1 can regulate transcription either by binding to promoters , like most known transcription activators , or by binding to the transcribed regions ( gene bodies ) , probably via RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) . Thus , Sfp1 's co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate , serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs , and a paradigm for the dual-role of some zinc-finger proteins . The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1 's relocation to the nascent transcripts , whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability . To function effectively as an integrated system , the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries must communicate through mechanisms that are still poorly understood . The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1 's dissociation from chromatin . Here , we focus on the zinc-finger Sfp1 , known to regulate transcription of proliferation-related genes . We propose that , following promoter recruitment , Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking . Intriguingly , Sfp1 dissociation from the chromatin correlates with the extent of the backtracked Pol II . The interplay between Sfp1 's two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined . Surprisingly , Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Based on the following observations , we propose that Sfp1 binds to Pol II in proximity to both DNA and Rpb4 , accompanying Pol II during elongation and influencing its configuration , thereby enhancing its propensity to backtrack ( Figure 8A ) : ( I ) Sfp1 physically interacts with Rpb4 , either directly or indirectly ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1 ) . These results , in combination with the weak interaction of Sfp1 with chromatin ( Figure 5A 'Sfp1 Control ' ) , are in accord with previous observation that expression of > 30 % of the genes , most are not considered to be direct targets of Sfp1 , is affected by either Sfp1 depletion or its overexpression . Given that proteins with zinc fingers , characteristic of many TFs , are known to be involved in DNA , RNA , and protein binding , it is conceivable that this zinc finger-containing protein is suitable for participating in the mRNA imprinting process , as proposed here ( Figure 8B ) . Given that RBPs have been proposed to perform multiple roles in RNA-based regulation of gene expression in mammals , we anticipate that the case of Sfp1 as an imprinting factor will serve an example of this important type of gene regulators in other eukaryotes . In summary , we propose that the role of certain class-specific TFs , such as Sfp1 , extends beyond merely controlling various stages of mRNA synthesis and processing in the nucleus ; they also regulate post-transcriptional functions in the cytoplasm . We propose that RNA-binding occurs co-transcriptionally for the following reasons : ( I ) Sfp1 export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is dependent on transcription ( Figure 1A ) , suggesting that it is exported together with the Pol II transcripts . The discovered effect of Sfp1 on its target genes , most of which are growth-related , provides a plausible mechanism to explain how growth-related genes avoid buffering when their expression must be rapidly adjusted to the ever-changing environment . We note that backtracking is influenced by the alteration of Rpb4 within the elongation complex , independently of Sfp1 , as the correlation between Rpb4 ChIP/Rpb3 ChIP ratios and BI is still present , albeit more mildly , in sfp1∆ . ( IV ) The ChIP-exo signal drops past the GCTGCT motif in C1-C2 genes ( for clusters ' definition see Figure 2B ) , a position where Sfp1 prefers to bind the motif containing CRAC + transcripts ( Figure 5C ) . This hypothesis is inspired by the following observations : ( I ) Sfp1 shows a positive general influence on mRNA stability that is maximal in those mRNAs that it physically binds ( Figure 4A 'HL , ' 4B , and 6 C ) . These observations suggest that , at least in some of their mRNA targets , Sfp1 is released from Rpb4-containing Pol II to the nascent transcripts co-transcriptionally as GCTGCT motif emerges from Pol II . We note , however , that , although changes in the stoichiometry are the most likely interpretation of the change in Rpb4 ChIP/Rpb3 ChIP ratio , this change can merely reflect changes in Pol II configuration that compromise the capacity of Rpb4 to produce ChIP signal . Further analysis that we performed using published ChIP-exo and ChEC-seq data has revealed an additional aspect of Sfp1 's binding behavior-it also interacts with gene bodies . Collectively , these findings demonstrate that CRAC + genes and their transcripts constitute a unique group , distinguishable from others based on several criteria , only one of them is the ability of their transcripts to bind Sfp1 . If the effect of Rap1 on mRNA stability

In the human body , the m rRNA is produced by a protein called RNA polymerase II . This protein is known to be involved in a number of processes , but it is not clear how this process is controlled . For example , it is thought that a gene called Sfp1 is involved in the synthesis of proteins , which can be used to control the cellular processes that make up a cell . However , there is still a long way to go to understand how SfP1 works . To do this , a group of proteins called TFs bind to a specific region of the RNA , known as the nucleus . During this process , Sfpe1 binds to the cytoplasm of the cell , where it is able to control how a particular molecule of RNA is translated into another molecule . It is also thought that Sfep1 can also control how many genes are translated into a new molecule by interacting with a small protein called Rpb4 .

[ABSTRACT] Here , we investigate the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots , focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO ( SMB ) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1 . Additionally , reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells , suggesting a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots . This demonstrates that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root . Mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica , primarily in the differentiation zone . smb-3 mutants additionally exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of S. indica-induced root-growth promotion . Programmed cell death occurring during plant development ( dPCD ) is a fundamental process integral for plant growth and reproduction .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] The importance of an intact root cap in plant-microbe interactions is further highlighted by the fact that the physical removal of root caps in maize plants leads to increased colonization of the root tip by the plant growth promoting rhizobacterium ( PGPR ) Pseudomonas fluorescens and to changes in the rhizosphere microbiome composition along the root axis . It was recently demonstrated that small active metabolites produced either by Toll/interleukin-1 receptor ( TIR ) -containing leucine-rich repeat ( NLR ) receptors or by fungal-derived enzymes through hydrolysis of RNA/DNA can mediate host cell death . This raises an exciting possibility that RNAse and DNAse activities of BFN1 may be involved in producing small , active nucleotide-derived metabolites that affect cell death , cell corpse clearance , proteostasis and fungal accommodation in the differentiation zone . This suggests an age-dependent dPCD in the outer epidermal layer of Arabidopsis roots where expression of BFN1 possibly pre-dates cortical and epidermal abscission during secondary root growth and contributes to clearance of cell corpses during periderm emergence . Likewise , malfunctions within regulated cell death in mammal gut epithelial cells produce death-induced nutrient release ( DINNR ) that can fuel bacterial growth and infection and could cause a variety of disorders such as inflammatory diseases . These results shed light on the complex relationship between PCD and microbial accommodation in plant roots , offering valuable insights into the development of plants that establish more efficient partnerships with beneficial microbes . Notably , we have shown that colonization by other beneficial microbes such as the closely related fungus S. vermifera and bacterial members of the Arabidopsis and H. vulgare microbiota also led to the downregulation of BFN1 in Arabidopsis . While we show that dPCD protects the meristem from microbial colonization , we propose that some adapted microbes manipulate host dPCD processes by affecting the transcriptional expression of BFN1 to facilitate accommodation in the root . The smb-3 mutants displayed hypercolonization along the entire primary root , suggesting that the extra sheet of cell corpses surrounding smb-3 roots provide additional and easily accessible nutrients that fuel fungal colonization . It thus represents a sophisticated physical mechanism to prevent or reduce intracellular microbial colonization near the root meristematic tissue and contributes to the maintenance of a beneficial interaction with root endophytes . This process resembles root cortical senescence and cell death in grass species such as wheat , barley , and corn , which typically start in the epidermis and spread toward the endodermis . Our results provide strong evidence that root cap size maintenance in the form of constant root cap cell turnover in Arabidopsis acts as a dynamic barrier , analogous to epidermal cell turnover in animals . Whether active interference by fungal effector proteins , fungal-derived signaling molecules or a systemic response of Arabidopsis roots underlies BFN1 downregulation by S. indica remains to be investigated . The root apical meristem embedded in this zone of the root tip is essential for root growth , as all primary root tissue originates from these continuously dividing stem cells . While the expression of the transcription factor SMB is restricted to the LRC , the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1 is expressed in different tissues undergoing dPCD and senescence below and above ground . This widespread distribution suggests that BFN1 plays a broader role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control throughout the root epidermis and differentiation zone . In conclusion , our data show that tight regulation of host dPCD in epidermal- and root cap-tissue plays an important role in restricting fungal colonization . In contrast , bfn1-1 mutation results in a more extensive and diffuse pattern of protein aggregation in the epidermal cell layer of the differentiation zone , regardless of the occurrence of cell death . These findings provide a valuable foundation for future studies investigating the dynamics of dPCD processes during beneficial symbiotic interactions and the potential manipulation of these processes by symbiotic partners . These findings emphasize the presence of a conserved pathway influenced by diverse beneficial microbes to downregulate BFN1 expression in epidermal

[ABSTRACT] In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs , ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes , dead eggs , or even fluid , supporting that distention consequences , rather than the presence of fertilized eggs , constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus . Conversely , restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production . Genetic disruption of C. elegans germline , sperm , oocytes , or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period . Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms , making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease . Large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to spreading pathogenic protein aggregates and promoting inflammatory responses , two mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative disease . Factors that regulate the extrusion of large vesicles , such as exophers produced by proteostressed C. elegans touch neurons , are poorly understood . We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons . Overall , genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths and genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths . Exopher production from the C. elegans ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3 , coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak . Here , we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] More broadly , proteome 'clean up ' phases may be programmed as key steps at specific transitions during development and homeostasis , for example , as occurs in the temporal lysosome activation that clears aggregate debris in C. elegans maturing oocytes or in the maturation of mouse adult neuronal stem cells via vimentin-dependent proteasome activity during quiescence exit . We speculate that young adult physiology might be temporally tweaked such that some tissues have optimized capacity to manage/degrade large aggregates and organelles at an early adult developmental 'clean up ' time , possibly analogous to how a town service for bulky oversized garbage pick-up might be limited to particular days during the year . At the same time , the neurodegeneration field has generated myriad studies linking Alzheimer 's disease susceptibility and AD pathology signatures such as extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β protein and/or intracellular accumulation of tau as outcomes of mechanical stress-based stimuli such as traumatic brain injury , arterial hypertension , and normal pressure hydrocephalus . Under no-sperm conditions , oocyte transit rates are lower than for fertilized eggs , and sperm-derived signals influence spermathecal valve opening , but if the egg-laying apparatus is genetically compromised and oocytes accumulate in the absence of sperm , exopher levels are high , suggesting deficits in spermatheca operations or sperm signals per se do not drive exophergenesis . Adhesion G-Protein Coupled Receptors , which have extracellular adhesion motifs and seven transmembrane domains characteristic of the GPCR class , or components of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional program may integrate responses to forces transmitted via the cytoskeleton and could be considered as potential players in the required signaling . We speculate that this young adult reconfiguration of proteostasis might reflect a mechanism to optimize successful reproduction , possibly both fine-tuning nervous system function and shifting resources balance to favor progeny as suggested by the disposable soma theory of aging proposed by Kirkwood . report that exophers produced by C. elegans muscle cells follow a similar time course of highest production at adult day 2 , and demonstrated a dependence of the temporal muscle exophergenesis pattern on eggs , and commonly with highest exopher production in muscles in the vicinity of the uterus ( muscle exophers may be released to supply nutrients to developing progeny ) . Examples of recent implication of mechanical stimuli in AD-related outcomes include that stretch in the brain vascular system can increase APP and B-secretase expression to increase Aβ production and that microglial mechanosensing via the Piezo1 mechanotransducing channel limits progression of Aβ pathology in mouse models . Modeling will also need to incorporate the fact that fluid injections , which require 2 min long sustained application of the filling stimulus to induce exophers , could provoke exopher production on a rapid timeframe , typically recorded only 10 min after the injection period . Thus , the simplest model we envision for the reproductive cues that influence maternal neuronal exophergenesis is that a filled uterus ( under normal conditions the consequence of hard-shelled eggs that occupy it ) is sensed and required for the early adult peak in exopher production . Working backward , exopher-promoting force seems unlikely to derive from the vulva or vulval muscle contractions , since when these cells are genetically disrupted in lin-39 RNAi or in sem-2 mutants , high levels of exophers still are generated . Our study reveals a capacity of mechanical force to influence neuronal release of large vesicles containing neurotoxic species , inviting more serious consideration of the roles of mechanobiology in maintaining proteostasis and influencing aggregate transfer within the context of a living nervous system . Given that under normal reproductive conditions of egg-laying proficiency , correctly shelled eggs are required for the early

[ABSTRACT] Our findings show that DKK3 expression is upregulated in the brains of AD subjects and that DKK3 protein levels increase at early stages in the disease . In hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse AD models , extracellular DKK3 levels are increased and DKK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques . Functionally , DKK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway . Studies reveal that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 ( DKK3 ) colocalizes to amyloid plaques in AD patients . Collectively , our findings identify DKK3 as a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD . Here , we investigate the contribution of DKK3 to synapse integrity in healthy and AD brains . In contrast , DKK3 knockdown restores synapse number and memory in hAPP-J20 mice . Increasing evidence supports a role for deficient Wnt signaling in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] These apparently paradoxical results could be reconciled by our finding that only a small proportion of DKK3 is released from neurons , and therefore changes in DKK3 protein levels are not detected in the total cell lysate . We found that extracellular DKK3 levels are elevated in brain slices from J20 and NLGF models before substantial amyloid burden occurs , whereas acute exposure to Aβo increase both total and extracellular DKK3 levels in neurons . Although loss of synapses around amyloid plaques is well described , changes in synapse number induced by silencing DKK3 is unlikely to be due to the formation of plaques as we observed similar synaptic changes when plaques are absent . Our functional studies in the J20 mouse model of AD demonstrate that knocking down DKK3 in J20 mice ameliorates the changes in excitatory and inhibitory synapse number in the hippocampus both before and after plaque deposition . Consistent with these findings , we demonstrate that DKK3 accumulates at both diffuse and dense-core Aβ plaques in two AD mouse models : the NLGF and J20 lines . Consistent with this suggestion , treatment with BFA , an inhibitor of vesicle transport used to study the release of proteins , blocks the increase in extracellular levels of DKK3 after cLTD . These findings are in agreement with other proteomic studies showing increased levels of DKK3 in different brain areas , including the hippocampus and in cortical synaptosomes of AD patients . Importantly , DKK3 elevation starts from early stages as we observed increased protein levels in Braak I-III subjects and in asymptomatic cases using a published proteomic dataset . The rescue of the synaptic and cognitive defects is specific to DKK3 downregulation as no differences in Dkk1 levels , a Wnt antagonist that affects synapses , are observed . Importantly , activation of canonical Wnt pathway by inhibition of GSK3 blocks DKK3-mediated excitatory synapse loss , which is consistent with a role for DKK3 as an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling . This finding suggests that other molecules might compensate for the loss of DKK3 resulting in the maintenance of excitatory synapse number under basal conditions in the healthy brain . Intriguingly , a study reported reduced levels of DKK3 in the human AD brain and an AD mouse model , but the specificity of the DKK3 antibody used in this study was not demonstrated . A previous study revealed that DKK3 is present at Aβ plaques in the brains of AD subjects , which was later confirmed by proteomic studies in human and mouse brains . Several studies showed that Aβo block glutamate uptake by neurons , raising the extracellular glutamate levels and aberrantly activating NMDARs , leading to impaired synaptic function and memory . Our functional analyses in AD models and our studies in human samples strongly support the notion that DKK3 contributes to synapse defects and memory impairment in AD . Our studies revealed that the increased extracellular DKK3 levels in the hippocampus of J20 and NLGF mice are completely abolished by blockade of NMDARs . In conclusion , our results are consistent with several other findings that DKK3 levels are increased in AD suggesting that elevated DKK3 may contribute to AD pathogenesis . Together , our results show that DKK3 regulates the stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the adult hippocampus through different signaling pathways . Conversely , in vivo knockdown of endogenous DKK3 in adult WT mice decreases inhibitory synapses but does not affect excitatory synapse density . However , this function is disrupted in the presence of toxic proteins such as Tau and , importantly , recovered by inhibition of GSK3β . In line with this view , knockdown of DKK3 does not affect the number or size of amyloid plaques in the J20 hippocampus . Given that LTD is increased in AD , these results suggest a possible mechanism for the regulation of DKK3 secretion in this condition . In this work , we investigated the function of the Wnt antagonist DKK3 on synaptic integrity and memory

This pathway helps cells to communicate with each other , and it is thought that this pathway is responsible for the formation of plaques in the brain .

When the mice were treated with the drug , they had a better sense of how their brains work . Further experiments revealed that , when the mice had been treated with BFA for two weeks , the levels were higher in the mice . Liu and Liu found that the mice that had been exposed to AO had fewer and smaller synapses . They also had less and smaller ones , suggesting that the effects of the drug on the brains of AD patients were more severe . Furthermore , these mice had less memory and less memories .

[ABSTRACT] Here , we show that the iron-chelating pyoverdines , siderophores produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp. , have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens . A screen of 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates used against 12 human pathogens uncovered several pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics . The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of the pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner . Thus , pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens . Pyoverdine increased survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host , mammalian cell lines , and erythrocytes . Furthermore , experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic . A common approach is to search for natural compounds deployed by microbes to inhibit competitors . The global rise of antibiotic resistance calls for new drugs against bacterial pathogens .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Especially the finding that pyoverdines have no negative effects on the survival of non-replicating NSC-34 cells is encouraging , as this cell line is representative of intact host tissue , in which iron is bound to strong chelators such as transferrin , lactoferrin , or ferritin . Combined with low toxicity to hosts at therapeutically effective concentrations and minimal potential for resistance evolution , these natural chelators hold promise as a new class of effective antibacterials , either as standalone treatments or in combination with conventional antibiotics . While we do not know the phenotypes of these mutations , one possibility is that increased biofilm formation could offer some protection against pyoverdine treatment , for example , by restricting pyoverdine from chelating free iron . Taken together , we predict that pyoverdine treatment could be highly potent against certain pathogens like A. baumannii and S. aureus that have less efficient siderophores and are unable to use the pyoverdine as iron source . One explanation is that such mutations ( albeit beneficial ) might not reach high frequencies in populations because increased siderophore production and secretion would increase the iron acquisition of resistant and non-resistant cells alike . For example , our experimental evolution setup did not allow for horizontal transfer of siderophore receptors , a scenario that might occur in the context of polymicrobial infections and confer resistance to pyoverdine therapy . While pyoverdine treatment may affect such signaling cascades in other pathogens as well , and thus potentially increase virulence factor production , we observed the opposite in S. aureus , which showed a loss of virulence genes . Our toxicity assays reveal that there is a range of pyoverdine concentrations for which only mild adverse effects against cell lines and G. mellonella larvae are observed and no hemolysis occurs . Finally , pyoverdines may have differential effects on the various members of the microbiota or the different pathogens in polymicrobial infections and thereby induces shifts in species composition due to the unequal suppression of community members . When administered as treatment to infected G. mellonella larvae , we observed significantly increased host survival rates in infections with A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae , demonstrating that pyoverdine exhibits antibacterial activity in hosts . By contrast , the adverse host effects of pyoverdines might come with additional opportunities , for instance , in cancer therapy , where siderophores reduce iron levels in tumors and slow tumor progression . However , these P. aeruginosa specific mechanisms require the presence of this pathogen , which is not the case when purified pyoverdines are used as a treatment against other pathogens like A. baumannii . Previous work showed that the pyoverdine of P. aeruginosa can retrieve iron from human transferrin when working in concert with proteases ( proteolytically degrading transferrin ) or phenazines ( spontaneously reducing ferric to ferrous iron ) . Consistent with the concept of iron competition , we observed that pyoverdine treatment is less effective against K. pneumoniae and was only potent for one out of three pyoverdines ( 3G07 , Figure 3 ) . Similarly , iron limitation can increase or decrease the formation of biofilms , depending on the species or strain , and it is well possible that pyoverdine treatment thus affects the propensity of pathogens to form biofilms . However , its efficacy as antibacterial is limited because of its low iron affinity and several pathogens have receptors for deferoxamine uptake and can thus use it as an iron source . Regarding pyoverdine treatment , this means that pathogens with regular siderophores will hit a double wall : their siderophores are immobilized by siderocalins , while pyoverdines lock away the remaining iron . These candidates could be distinguished from non-inhibitory pyoverdines by their high CCS values ( standing for larger and more complex molecules ) and their higher iron complexation stability . Our approach offers a distinct advantage by utilizing naturally evolved iron chelators from non-pathogenic species , which possess unique chemical structures and exceptionally high iron affinities
[METHODS] ",,879,92,None,"Bacteria are a group of microbes that live in the environment . They can cause diseases such as bacterial infections , and they can also cause cancer . The bacteria that cause these infections are known as bacteria . However , bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics are still able to survive . This is because bacteria that have a mutation in one of their genes , called a siderophage , are unable to use the iron they receive from their host to grow . Infections with these bacteria can lead to death , which can be fatal if they are not treated properly . One of the most common antibiotics used against bacteria is the antibiotic Pseudomonas . It is thought that Ps , the bacteria that causes the most infections in humans , is responsible for the rise of antibiotic resistance . But it is not clear how P . aeruginosa is related to other bacteria , such as Klebsiella pneumoniae , or Staphylococcus aureus . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used 320 natural Psp . isolates from 12 human pathogens to study the effects of pyoverdines on the growth of these bacteria based on their chemical properties . These 320 isolates were used against 12 different human pathogenic bacteria and found that the most potent , pYoverdine , was found to reduce the growth rate of the bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii , K . pneumoniae and S . aureous .

[ABSTRACT] To address that question , we developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits that can explain the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits we recently observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia . This is a crucial gap in our understanding because it prevents us from discovering how genetic mutations and environmental risks that alter synaptic function cause prefrontal network to fail in schizophrenia . These findings strongly parallel dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony we observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior , as well as the suppression of this 0-lag spiking by administration of NMDAR antagonists . As such , our cortical network model provides a plausible mechanism explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia . We show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs such as might occur during behavior . We analyze how the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influence oscillatory spike synchrony to inform the biological data . Schizophrenia results in part from a failure of prefrontal networks but we lack full understanding of how disruptions at a synaptic level cause failures at the network level .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Although these modeling studies provide important mechanistic insight into prefrontal network dynamics underlying working memory , and potentially , working memory deficits in schizophrenia , they do not address the topic of the current study , which is how slow NMDAR recurrent excitation and external input received by the network jointly influence spike timing dynamics at the neuron level and oscillatory dynamics at the population level in the presence of fast AMPA excitation and GABA inhibition . Given these considerations , the convergent spike desynchronization we observed in monkey drug and mouse genetic models could be explained by an inverted U-shaped relationship wherein either too little NMDAR function ( as produced by NMDAR blockade in monkeys ) or too much NMDAR function ( as predicted to result from deletion of Dgcr8 in mice ) decreases the frequency of 0-lag spiking between prefrontal neurons . Key parameters that could influence the diversity of outcomes among studies include whether or not axonal conduction delays and the geometry of recurrent connections are incorporated into the models ( since circuit architecture and associated signal conduction delays powerfully influences when action potentials arrive at pre- and postsynaptic elements ) , as well as the specific form of the STDP rule employed . These studies did not for example contrast the effect of low versus high doses of an NMDAR agonist ( such as NMDA ) on spike synchrony in the monkey model , nor relate reduction in spike synchrony specifically to the upregulation of NMDAR subunit expression in the mouse model ( rather than the many other proteins regulated by miRNA that are dependent on Dgcr8 ) . Prior theoretical studies have investigated circuit and synaptic mechanisms that can generate persistent activity in recurrent prefrontal networks , specifically addressing how reducing NMDAR function destabilizes attractor states ( patterns of stable neural activity ) in these networks during a delay period ( when the memory of the stimulus must be retained ) leading to working memory deficits . Compte and colleagues carried out spiking network simulations with different relative contributions of the NMDAR and AMPAR mediated currents to the recurrent excitation and showed that with less NMDA but more AMPA currents , the asynchronous steady state becomes unstable and neurons begin to synchronize , leading to network oscillations in the gamma band . However , the diversity of results obtained from theoretical studies of STDP outlined above make it difficult to conclude that the reduction in synchronous spiking we observed would lead to synaptic disconnection via STDP , imposing important constraints on our prior hypothesis , although this remains a possibility . We showed that λ , in essence , directly depends only on the AMPAR synaptic conductance ; it is virtually independent of the NMDAR conductance due to the slow synaptic decay time constant , while the dependence on the GABAR conductance is much weaker compared to AMPAR because of nearly 90° effective phase lag introduced by synaptic filtering . These include the emergence of 0-lag synchronous spiking between individual prefrontal neurons when external inputs to the network push it across this state boundary , and failure of synchronous spiking to emerge between prefrontal neurons when NMDAR synaptic currents are reduced , as we have observed in neural recordings in primate prefrontal cortex . To gain further insights into how specifically synaptic conductances and external rate affect emergence of synchronous oscillations , we obtained an analytic approximation for the oscillatory instability growth rate λ describing the dependence on these parameters near the boundary between the asynchronous and synchronous states where λ=0 . We previously hypothesized that reduced synchrony at the level of spiking neurons could disconnect prefrontal local circuits via spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity , contributing to the reduction in dendritic spine density that has been observed in postmortem analysis of prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia .

[METHODS] ",,903,94,None,"Schizophrenia is a disorder that affects millions of people worldwide . The disease is caused by a mutation in a protein called NMDAR , which is involved in the production of a neurotransmitter called GABA . This protein is found in the brains of many different species , including humans , but it is not known how this protein works in schizophrenia . It is thought that the loss of the N MDAR protein can lead to a decrease in the activity of the neurons in the prefrontal cortex . However , there is no evidence that this is the case . To address this question , Weiss et al . developed a model of the brain that can explain how a disruption in the function of NMDA in schizophrenia causes the network to fail . In this model , we use a monkey model to study how the activity and timing of the synaptic connections between neurons are affected . These experiments show that a reduction in the number of synaptical connections between the neurons is necessary to ensure that the network does not become unstable , and that this decrease in activity leads to the network becoming unstable . Moreover , the model also shows that reducing the amount of synapses in the network prevents the network from shifting from a steady state to an oscillatory state . Further experiments showed that the concentrations of the neuron's signaling pathway , known as AMPA and NMDA , influence how the neurons respond to stimuli . Weisson e"

[ABSTRACT] Here , by combining a controlled experimental angiogenesis model with mathematical and computational analyses , we find that the regular spatial Tip-Stalk cell patterning can undergo an order-disorder transition at a relatively high input level of a pro-angiogenic factor VEGF . Together , our data suggest that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation enabling but not instructing subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis , which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms . We further find that sprouts form in a manner maximizing their mutual distance , consistent with a Turing-like model that may depend on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin . The initial steps of angiogenesis depend on robust differentiation of oligopotent endothelial cells into the Tip and Stalk phenotypic cell fates , controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell-cell communication . Angiogenesis is a morphogenic process resulting in the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones , usually in hypoxic micro-environments . The resulting differentiation is robust but temporally unstable for most cells , with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions . This analysis can assist in further understanding of cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and other complex morphogenic processes . The dynamics of spatial patterning of this cell fate specification are only partially understood .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Endothelial fate induction process may be interesting to contrast with other complex multicellular processes , including collective epithelial migration , where NOTCH signaling similarly modulates fine-grained patterns of leader and follower cells , and underscore the need in the future to develop more refined models that explicitly integrate the interconnections between biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip-Stalk fate . Although the actual mechanism of putative Turning-like pattern formation is not fully elucidated here , our results are consistent with a variant of this regulatory behavior , in which a component of the ECM , fibronectin is actively redistributed by the nascent sprouts , with this ECM component being enriched at the points of sprout formation , but depleted in other zones , thus preventing sprout induction in the depleted areas . This dynamic fate-switching behavior can thus represent a signature of an unstable differentiation process that may either stabilize , in response to additional cues , leading to a specific morphogenetic outcome , such as the extension of a stable sprout , or display a prolonged instability resulting in a lack of pronounced morphogenesis . For instance , our prior analysis indicated that exposure of model parental vessels to VEGF only rather than a more complete pro-angiogenic cocktail of various factors , can result in formation of mini-sprouts ( and hence , effective Tip-Stalk cell differentiation ) , but not full-fledged sprouts . A major challenge of the analysis of tissue development and homeostasis is understanding of how differentiation into distinct cell types can be robustly achieved , while also being sensitive to various pro-differentiation and morphogenic cues and , potentially affected by molecular noise in biochemical reactions . Although , questions remain about the mechanistic underpinnings of the phenomena observed here and in related studies , the analysis enabled by these model systems can help formulate guiding hypotheses for further understanding of angiogenesis in vivo , while decoupling the complexities of the native angiogenic environments . These results suggested that cell specification patterns deviating from the expected 'salt-and-pepper ' one can develop not only due to noisy NOTCH signaling , as suggested by prior models , but also due to the control of the fractions of alternative cell states by the magnitude the pro-differentiation cue . In spite of the observation that disordered 'salt-and-pepper ' patterns still display robust differentiation , the spatial patterns of cell co-localization can generate inherent instabilities , for example , due to two adjacent Tips mutually suppressing their fate selection through NOTCH signaling . Of note , another version of the Turing mechanism has recently been suggested to account for the branching of the sprouts , also involving formation of new Tip cells leading individual branches , although the molecular mechanism postulated in that analysis was distinct from the one proposed here . On the other hand , our results also suggest that an increase of VEGF levels can introduce disorder into this pattern , similar to order-disorder transition for various composite materials , which may occur with increasing temperature and have the properties of a sharp phase transition . These may include the effects of pericytes or local inflammatory environments , as mentioned above , but also other ECM components , such as collagens , that may enhance the protrusion of Tip cells and thus stabilize the emergent sprouts both directly and indirectly . A plausible mechanism for this inhibition and the overall pattern formation is the redistribution of fibronectin from the zones between sprouts toward the incipient sprouts , constituting both a positive and negative feedback loops , commonly assumed in a variant of the Turing patterns from action . In particular , in many circumstances , the levels of VEGF are determined by the degree of hypoxia , which can be highly elevated following oxygen supply interruption , for example , in wound healing or ischemia , or due to progression of neoplastic growth .
[METHODS] ",,894,93,None,"Angiogenesis is a process in which new blood vessels are formed from existing ones . This process is called angiogenic , and it involves the formation of new vessels from pre-existing ones , usually in hypoxic conditions . The first step in angitogenic morphogenesis is to develop new blood vessel types , which are then re-established . However , the process is not fully understood . To understand how angiogenesis works , it is important to understand how the cells that form the new vessels are able to communicate with each other . For example , a cell called the Tip and Stalk cells can communicate with other cells in the same way , but they can also communicate with one another . In this way the cells can be more easily differentiated into different types of cells , or they can be rearranged into different shapes . It is not clear how these changes are made , however , because it is not known how these cells behave . Now , Wang et al . have used a computer model to study the process of angiogenetic morphology . Using this model , they show that a protein called NOTCH is involved in determining the fate of the cells . When the protein is activated , only a small subset of the newly-created Tip cells can lead to sprouts . These sprouts form in a manner that maximizes their mutual distance , while minimizing the distance between them . Wang also found that the sprouts can be depleted by a factor called VEGF , making them unstable . Further experiments showed that the signaling molecules that activate NOTCH are also involved in the process . Thus , these findings could help to better understand how a morphogenic process works ."

[ABSTRACT] Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine , several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions . We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation . We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity . Here , we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice . However , the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown . In some cases , it appears that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine . Finally , we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation , while norepinephrine is not . Locus coeruleus ( LC ) projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory .
[INTRODUCTION] 
[RESULTS] 
[DISCUSSION] Across all intensities , LC responses were larger to the aversive stimuli than to neutral auditory stimuli , suggesting that the LC may encode some information about the emotional valence of stimuli in addition to the simple sensory salience - though to determine this conclusively would require equating the salience of stimuli across the somatosensory and auditory modalities while varying the emotional valence , which may not be possible , especially in a rodent model . However , it was important to test whether LC-HPC projections respond during trace conditioning directly , as more recent work suggests the LC may be composed of many distinct 'modules ' of neurons that project to separate regions and it is not yet known whether these modules exhibit different response properties . Previous work has shown that LC neurons can respond more to conditioned than non-conditioned stimuli ; however , to our knowledge , this is the first demonstration of increased LC responding to the CS in a trace conditioning task where the CS and US are separated by an extended interval . For example , in our optogenetic experiment ( Figure 4 ) phasic LC stimulation may have enhanced stimulus detection and allowed the relatively weak stimuli that were used to capture the animals ' attention and produce learning when they otherwise would not . Using DREADDs , we were able to show that direct LC stimulation drives increases in both dopamine and norepinephrine in the HPC , consistent with a number of recent studies indicating their co-release from LC terminals in the hippocampus and neocortex . Thus , some care must be taken in conflating the characteristics and/or function of the relatively short-lasting responses presented here and the extremely fast phasic responses to very brief ( μs to ms ) sensory stimuli reported previously . Based on this previous work and our data showing learning-related activity in LC-HPC projections , we believe that LC release of dopamine into the hippocampus is at least partially responsible for our observed effects . Our finding that systemic β-adrenergic receptor antagonism has no effect on trace fear memory formation was surprising in light of previous work demonstrating memory impairments after infusions of adrenergic antagonists into the hippocampus or amygdala . We did not observe obvious changes in tonic LC-HPC activity in our data , although these changes may be more subtle and occur over longer time scales that would be difficult to detect using fiber photometry . Given our data showing that dopamine , and not norepinephrine , is required for trace fear memory formation , the most direct possibility is that the release of dopamine from the LC enhances learning-related plasticity in regions supporting trace fear conditioning . However , due to the predominant use of spatial memory tasks in which the learned information is experienced diffusely in time , the precise temporal dynamics of learning-related LC and LC-HPC activity remain poorly understood . Therefore , while it is not possible to completely rule out increased hippocampal dopamine via a LC-midbrain-HPC circuit based on our studies , direct release of dopamine from LC terminals in HPC is more likely . However , because of the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent sensors relative to electrophysiology , we can not rule out the possibility that these responses are somehow different in nature from previously reported phasic LC responses . The presence of the same responses in the LC-HPC axon terminals that were seen in LC cell bodies fits with the canonical view of the LC as a largely homogenous structure whose neurons ' axons are highly collateralized . Distinguishing between these plasticity and cognitive modulation accounts of LC-driven memory enhancements would be difficult as many of the same cellular mechanisms are likely involved in both processes . This may indicate some level of top-down influence over the LC by the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex , as both of these
[METHODS] ",,893,93,None,"Brain cells called the hippocampus are responsible for storing information about the world around us . This information can be stored in the brain’s memory , which can then be used to make decisions about how to live and work . However , it is not clear how the brain processes this information , or how it does so . For example , a brain cell called the Locus coeruleus ( LC ) is thought to release a neurotransmitter called dopamine into the brain . The LC releases this neuron into the dorsal cortex , where it can be used as a model to study how animals learn and remember their environment . Previous studies have shown that LC neurons can release dope and norepinephrine , but it was not clear whether these two neuron proteins are involved in the process of learning and memory . To investigate this question , Wang et al . studied mice that had been trained to fear a particular type of fear , and found that the mice were more likely to remember the fear than the mice that did not . These mice were then given a test to see if the mice could recall the fear they had experienced when they were trained to avoid the fear . When the mice learned to avoid a fear involving a stranger , the mice had a better understanding of how the animals learned to fear the stranger than they did when they learned to ignore the stranger . In addition , they were able to recall how they felt when they heard the stranger’s voice .
