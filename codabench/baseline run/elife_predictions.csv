[ABSTRACT] Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell–cell communication, known as ‘chemical’ and ‘electrical’ synapses, respectively. Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components. Electrical synapses are, on the other hand, generally defined by the presence of a ‘gap junction’ ( a cluster of intercellular channels ) between two neuronal processes. However, while gap junctions provide the communicating process, it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures. We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells, at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse. Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures. Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components. Remarkably, most of the synaptic contact’s surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. Thus, our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one, but multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses. Synapses are specialized cell–cell contacts where two neurons can share relevant functional information. The exchange of information can occur directly through cell–cell channels, known as ‘electrical synapses’, or indirectly, via the release of a chemical messenger, known as ‘chemical synapses’ . While the molecular complexity of chemical synapses with structurally distinct pre- and postsynaptic components has long been recognized , less is known regarding the molecular and structural complexity of electrical synapses. Electrical synapses are a modality of neuronal communication mediated by structures known as ‘gap junctions’ ( GJs ) . These structures contain intercellular channels formed by the apposition of two hemichannels, each provided by one of the connected cells, and which cluster together into GJ ‘plaques’ . Hemichannels are formed by proteins called ‘connexins’ in vertebrates and ‘innexins’ in invertebrates that, though unrelated in sequence, share a similar membrane topology that allows them to assemble into intercellular channels. While GJs are ubiquitous and present in virtually every tissue of the organism providing metabolic coupling , they additionally serve as a pathway of low resistance for the spread of electrical currents between neurons ( and cells of the heart ), the main form of signaling in the brain, which is fast enough to operate within the time frame required for decision-making by neural circuits . Electrical synapses are generally perceived as structurally simpler than chemical synapses and exclusively involving the function of intercellular channels. However, recent results show that the function of these channels is under the control of their supporting molecular scaffold , suggesting that neuronal GJs are complex molecular structures whose function requires the contribution of multiple molecular components . Such molecular complexity is likely to underlie plastic changes in the strength of electrical synapses , which are capable of dynamically reconfiguring neural circuits .

[ABSTRACT] The pre-Bötzinger complex ( preBötC ), a key primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm, contains neurons that project directly to facial nucleus ( 7n ) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons, we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity, with minimal effects on breathing. These effects are altered by the type of anesthetic employed and also between anesthetized and conscious states. The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity. We show that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors. This is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases. Breathing is a complex behavior requiring the coordination of multiple motor patterns in the face, upper airways, thorax, and abdomen to enable gas exchange between the external and internal environment and maintenance of blood gas homeostasis . Strict coordination of breathing with the activity of facial and upper airway muscles underlies the rhythmic orofacial behaviors, such as sniffing, sucking, licking, whisking, vocalization, and swallowing, which are fundamental for ingestive and exploratory behavior, and social interaction . Breathing-related information permeates the brain with respiratory modulation of suprapontine brain structures affecting cognitive function and emotional expression . Similarly, coordination of this motor activity with autonomic nervous system activity produces phasic fluctuations of blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate ( HR ) that are essential for optimizing cardiac efficiency and organ blood flow . The network of neurons coordinating breathing is distributed throughout the brainstem, with a major group responsible for generating inspiration located in the pre-Bötzinger complex ( preBötC ) within the ventrolateral medulla oblongata . In rodents, the preBötC consists of a heterogeneous population of ~3000 neurons with distinct, but intermingled, excitatory and inhibitory subgroups . Anatomical studies showed that preBötC sends parallel excitatory and inhibitory projections to target nuclei throughout the brain, including to regions responsible for respiratory motor activity . As indicated by their extensive projections, preBötC neurons modulate many circuits in addition to those required for breathing activity. For example, preBötC neurons project monosynaptically to key medullary centers for autonomic regulation, and modulate cardiorespiratory coupling . Photoinhibition of preBötC neurons produces the expected apnea, but also causes a significant reduction of sympathetic vasomotor activity, reduces respiratory modulation of BP, and increases cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity to decrease HR and respiratory-sinus arrhythmia . Neurons in the preBötC also modulate orofacial behaviors. Activation of the developing brain homeobox1 ( Dbx1 ) -expressing preBötC neurons alters the networks responsible for the coordination of upper airways and swallowing, to decrease the probability of swallowing during inspiration . The preBötC also contributes to motor patterns that are necessary for exploratory behaviors, such as sniffing and whisking. In this case, a group of inhibitory preBötC neurons provide monosynaptic inputs onto the vibrissal premotor neurons in the intermediate reticular nucleus ( vIRt ) to helped synchronous whisking.

[ABSTRACT] Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm, their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably by amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception, and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger. Effective survival necessitates a repertoire of dynamic defensive behaviors, encompassing both passive and active responses. Passive defensive strategies, such as freezing, help avoid detection from predators by reducing motion . In contrast, active defensive behaviors, including fleeing or fighting, enable animals to swiftly escape or confront imminent threats . The ability to adaptively switch between passive and active defenses in response to varying threat contexts is essential for optimizing survival outcomes, as demonstrated by studies utilizing naturalistic threat stimuli like predator-like robots or looming disks, which allowed the observation of various critical defensive behaviors . A critical component of this adaptive response is the general alarm signal, which detects danger and plays a role in eliciting appropriate defensive behaviors in the face of threats. These signals help organisms quickly recognize and respond to potential threats. The mechanisms underlying these alarm signals can be studied through Pavlovian fear conditioning . In this process, a neutral sensory stimulus ( conditioned stimulus or CS ) is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus ( US ), leading to a conditioned response ( CR ) that can be expressed as either freezing or fleeing, depending on the specific features of the CS and US . Neurons within the PBN that express CGRP have been suggested to function as general alarm signals in the brain . These neurons respond to noxious stimuli of diverse sensory modalities and transmit interoceptive and exteroceptive information to the forebrain . Additionally, these CGRP neurons relay US information to the central amygdala during conventional fear conditioning with electric footshock . Prior studies have primarily focused on the role of CGRP neurons in mediating passive freezing behavior, demonstrating that activation of these neurons exclusively elicits immediate freezing behavior and contributes to the formation of fear memories . However, for CGRP neurons to serve as a true general alarm system, they must be capable of transmitting threat-related signals and facilitating the coordination of appropriate defensive behaviors, whether passive or active. While the role of CGRP neurons in passive responses is well-established, their potential involvement in active defensive behaviors remains unexplored.

[ABSTRACT] The relationship between obesity and human brain structure is incompletely understood. Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ∼30, 000 UK Biobank participants, we test the idea that obesity ( waist-to-hip ratio, WHR ) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction ( ICVF ), an index of neurite density. We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid ( MOR ) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. Conversely, the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein ( CRP ), we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF ( rg = 0. 026, P = 0. 36 ) and ICVF ( rg = 0. 112, P < 9×10−4 ) as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF ( P<0. 05 ). These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation. Obesity has long been recognised as a preventable risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders such as heart disease and type-2 diabetes. More recently, it has also emerged as an important risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, linked to both an increased risk of dementia and accelerated age-associated cognitive decline . Defined as the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in the body , the worldwide prevalence of obesity has more than doubled in the last thirty years, making it one of the most important global public health challenges . To date, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies investigating effects of obesity on the brain have focused almost exclusively on macroscopic aspects of brain structure such as total grey matter volume and cortical thickness. Results in this field were often contradictory: although studies tended to report lower gray matter volume in relation to obesity, some have also observed null or positive associations as described in a meta-analysis by García-García et al., 2019, who noted that the likely reasons for this were heterogeneities in brain and obesity metrics, a wide variation in sample size, and poor statistical methodology. However, the emerging consensus indicates that typically studies are reporting negative associations between obesity ( particularly visceral obesity indexed by waist to hip ratio: WHR ) and ( smaller ) total grey matter volume and ( thinner ) cortical thickness . Notably, this negative association between body mass index ( BMI ) and global grey matter volume has been substantiated in a recent large-scale study conducted in the UK Biobank involving 9652 participants .

[ABSTRACT] Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental cancer models. However, tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the tissue surrounding human tumour specimens, leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain. We have previously identified both EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers that, alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin, identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines. This afforded the opportunity to investigate whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours. Examining disseminating tumour cells in over 12, 000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours, we see a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD24 and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens. Through training an artificial neural network, these predict metastasis with high accuracy ( cross-validated accuracy of 87–89% ). In this study, we have observed single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens, and these are highly predictive of metastatic disease. In multiple types of carcinoma, cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to enable metastatic dissemination from the primary tumour . This model of metastatic dissemination has been built from studies using murine models and human cancer cell line models. However, this process has not been observed in human tumours in the in vivo setting, leading to uncertainty over the relevance of these findings to human tumour metastasis . A key complication with efforts to study metastatic processes in human tumours is the inability to trace cell lineage. As cancer cells exiting the tumour downregulate epithelial markers whilst undergoing EMT, they become indistinguishable from the mesenchymal non-tumour cells surrounding the tumour . Therefore, once these cells detach from the tumour body and move away they are lost to analysis. Attempts have been made to use the retention of epithelial markers alongside acquisition of mesenchymal markers to identify cells undergoing EMT in human tumours . However, these studies were limited to characterising cells undergoing the earliest stages of EMT whilst still attached to the cohesive body of the primary tumour. EMT must be followed by the reverse process of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ) to enable new tumour growth at secondary sites, and therefore retained plasticity manifested as ability to revert to an epithelial phenotype is an important feature of metastatic CSCs . We have previously demonstrated that a CD44highEpCAMlow/- EMT population can be separated from the main CD44lowEpCAMhigh epithelial population in flow cytometric analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) cell lines and fresh tumour specimens . We identified retained cell surface expression of EpCAM and CD24 in a minority of cells that have undergone a full morphological EMT. Both EpCAM and CD24 were individually associated with enhanced ability to undergo MET, and thus are markers of EMT CSCs exhibiting retained plasticity. We therefore reasoned that retention of one or both of these markers may identify an important population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated from the primary tumour in human tumour specimens, and are responsible for subsequent metastatic seeding. Here, we characterise the combined role of EpCAM and CD24 in marking a population of disseminating tumour cells in human OSCC specimens.

[ABSTRACT] Apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that drive tissue repair. However, the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a map of the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds. We find that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident Lyve1+ macrophages, during inflammation. Interestingly, human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6. During early inflammation in mouse wounds, we detect upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis. By contrast, inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor, Timd4, in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair. These data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients. Proper tissue function and homeostasis require efficient and effective repair of injury. Repair of mammalian tissues requires highly dynamic changes in cellular heterogeneity and communication to correctly heal tissue, usually resulting in a scar rather than true tissue regeneration. Cell death is a common event during tissue injury, and several studies from hydra to mice have shown the importance of apoptosis in the initiation of inflammation to drive reparative processes . Proper initiation and subsequent resolution of inflammation is essential for tissue repair and progression to the proliferation stage of healing, when fibroblasts, blood vessels, and other tissue-specific cells proliferate and migrate, forming new tissue to repair the wound. While several signaling factors have been shown to induce apoptosis in wounds , the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells are recognized and regulate tissue repair are not well understood. The skin is an excellent model to define the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells regulate tissue repair. After injury, mammalian skin undergoes stages of repair beginning with inflammation, which removes debris and pathogens. As inflammation regresses, the proliferative phase leads to the coordination of epidermal keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial, and immune cells to reseal the epidermal barrier and generate a reparative scar including new ECM production and revascularization . Apoptosis occurs after skin injury, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells – or efferocytosis – by macrophages reduces inflammatory signaling and repair in several tissues . Yet, it is unclear how apoptosis controls skin wound healing. Apoptotic cell death is characterized by cytomorphological alterations, DNA fragmentation, activation of caspases and other regulators, and finally membrane alterations including outer membrane exposure of phosphatidylserine ( PtdSer ), which allows the recognition of apoptotic cells by cellular receptors on phagocytes . The most well-studied receptors that allow phagocytes to bind and phagocytose apoptotic cells include the TAM ( Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk ) tyrosine kinases and the TIM ( T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain ) family of receptors . While TIM receptors can directly bind PtdSer, TAM receptors require their ligands growth-arrest-specific 6 ( Gas6 ) and protein S ( Pros1 ) to bind to PtdSer . To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which apoptosis regulates skin wound healing, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on cells from murine wound beds 24 hr and 48 hr after injury.

[ABSTRACT] Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided new insights into the dynamics of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues and have enabled the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge. We describe a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools in Drosophila to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. This method, called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ), involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population of interest. By creating many such independently barcoded fly strains, TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, identification of multiplet droplets, and barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to helped population-scale behavioral measurements. Thus, TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments. Spatially and temporally regulated gene expression patterns are a hallmark of multicellular life and function to orchestrate patterning, growth, and differentiation throughout development . In mature organisms, spatial expression patterns both in tissues and within cells define functionally distinct compartments and determine many aspects of cellular and organismal physiology . In addition, such expression patterns differentiate healthy and diseased tissue and impact disease etiology . Spatial and temporal expression patterns, which can be used to distinguish between cell types and provide insight into cellular function, also provide a means to understand the organization and physiology of complex tissues such as the brain . Thus, strong and scalable tools for measuring spatial and temporal gene expression patterns at a genome-wide scale and at high resolution would be transformative research tools across many biological disciplines. Single-cell sequencing technologies have provided insights into the dynamics of gene expression throughout development, been used to characterize somatic variation and heterogeneity within tissues, and are currently enabling the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases . However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge. The cellular identities of gene expression clusters identified in cell atlas data sets are typically inferred from the expression of distinctive gene sets , and the lack of positive identification of gene expression clusters introduces an element of uncertainty in this analysis. Moreover, this process of manual annotation is labor-intensive and often requires additional experiments to determine or confirm the expression patterns of marker genes. Emerging spatial genomics technologies hold promise in linking anatomical and transcriptomic information . Several of the emerging commercial spatial genomics technologies rely on in situ sequencing of marker genes allowing droplet-based single-cell transcriptomic data to be mapped onto a tissue. However, these technologies currently suffer from constraints related to cost, content, or applicability to specific model systems. In addition to descriptive cell atlas projects, studies involving multiple experimental timepoints throughout development and aging, or studies assessing the effects of experimental exposures or genetic manipulations would benefit from increased ability to multiplex samples. Given the fixed costs of droplet-based single-cell sequencing, generating data for single-cell transcriptomic time courses or experimental manipulations can be costly.

[ABSTRACT] Understanding the origins of new, complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology. Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the new ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species, without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended. As a result, our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete. Here, we provide new data showing that, in contrast to previous studies, species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. Thus, our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics, we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins. Complex phenotypes can evolve by leveraging phenotypic plasticity in existing traits with concerted change in developmental modules . However, the evolutionary trajectory that animals take to traverse an adaptive landscape from one phenotype to another may be difficult to reconstruct given that they often must cross or avoid adaptive valleys, which include phenotypes that are not always readily observed in populations . Nevertheless, phenotype diversity can help us unravel origins of new traits and reveal the physiological trade-offs associated with their evolutionary trajectory . Acquired chemical defenses, or the ability to sequester and use chemicals from the environment against predators or parasites, is one complex phenotype whose evolutionary history has proved difficult to characterize . Although human interest in poisonous plants and animals is old — dating back millennia — we have only recently begun to explained the specific mechanisms involved in acquired chemical defenses . This persisting gap in knowledge may be partly explained by a historical lack of integration between systems biology and pharmacology . Here, we incorporate ideas from pharmacokinetics with data from poison frogs ( Anura: Dendrobatidae ) into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in poison frogs and more generally in other animals. In the following text, we use the terms alkaloid and toxin interchangeably, although the toxicity of each poison frog alkaloid is not always known or very straightforward . Similarly, for simplicity we broadly bin species as defended ( high alkaloid content ) or undefended ( low or zero alkaloid content ), although little information exists regarding the defensive efficacy of specific alkaloids. In this context, we use the term alkaloid to refer to compounds with nitrogen-containing rings, specifically the subset of lipophilic alkaloids representing classes previously described in anuran integument, for example ‘N-methyldecahydroquinolines’ or ‘lehmizidines’ .

[ABSTRACT] Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) contributes significantly to chemotherapy resistance and remains a critical challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ), has hindered the development of effective treatments. In this study, we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. Our findings revealed elevated ribosome biogenesis ( RiBi ) during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes. RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signalings are essential for EMT/MET completion. Importantly, inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells. Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies. Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer. Tumor cells exploit the transdifferentiation program of EMT to acquire aggressive properties, including anchorage-independent survival, invasion, and stemness . Multiple growth factors ( TGFβ, EGF, Wnts, etc ), signaling pathways ( Smad2/3, PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2, etc ), EMT transcription factors ( Snail, Twist, Zeb1/2, etc ), and hundreds of downstream EMT related genes are involved in the EMT program . Such complexity leads to a wide spectrum of EMT phenotypes coexisting at different stages of tumors . The EMT-endowed features contribute to tumor heterogeneity, metastasis, and therapy resistance, making EMT an attractive therapeutic target. Current EMT-targeting strategies focus on blocking EMT stimuli, signaling transduction, or mesenchymal features . However, these approaches may paradoxically promote the reversed process of EMT, MET, which also contributes to malignancy development . Therefore, we proposed that instead of targeting epithelial or mesenchymal phenotype, inhibiting a biological process mediating the transitions of both EMT and MET could effectively overcome the limitations of traditional strategies . To investigate the EMT process in metastatic tumor progression, we previously developed an EMT lineage-tracing model ( Tri-PyMT ) by combining MMTV-PyMT, Fsp1 ( S100a4 ) -Cre, and Rosa26-mTmG transgenic mice . This model traces EMT via a permanent RFP-to-GFP fluorescence switch induced by mesenchymal-specific Cre expression. The absence of EMT reporting in metastatic lesions in this model has sparked a lively debate about the proper definition of EMT status in tumor cells and the biological significance of EMT in tumor progression . Rheenen’s group also posited that the Fsp1-Cre mediated EMT lineage tracing model might not accurately capture the majority of EMT events in comparison to an E cadherin-CFP model . Although we disagree with this assessment of the Fsp1-Cre model’s fidelity in tracing EMT, we acknowledge the limitations of relying on a single EMT marker to investigate the EMT contributions in tumor metastasis. Notably, using the refined EMTracer animal models, Li et al., 2020 discovered that N-cadherin + cells, rather than the Vimintin + cells, were predominantly enriched in lung metastases. These findings with different mesenchymal-specific markers underscore the complex nature of the EMT process; metastasis formation does not necessarily require the expression of many traditional mesenchymal markers. The Tri-PyMT model, despite its limitations in comprehensive tracing of metastasis, provides unique opportunities to study EMT’s role in tumor progression and chemoresistance. In particular, the fluorescent marker switch of the established Tri-PyMT cell line reliably reports changes in EMT phenotypes .

[ABSTRACT] Seedling root traits impact plant establishment under challenging environments. Pearl millet is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops that provides a vital food source across the sub-Saharan Sahel region. Pearl millet’s early root system features a single fast-growing primary root which we hypothesize is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using crop modeling, we demonstrate that early drought stress is an important constraint in agrosystems in the Sahel where pearl millet was domesticated. Furthermore, we show that increased pearl millet primary root growth is correlated with increased early water stress tolerance in field conditions. Genetics including genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) approaches identify genomic regions controlling this key root trait. Combining gene expression data, re-sequencing and re-annotation of one of these genomic regions identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene PgGRXC9 as the candidate stress resilience root growth regulator. Functional characterization of its closest Arabidopsis homolog AtROXY19 revealed a new role for this glutaredoxin ( GRX ) gene clade in regulating cell elongation. In summary, our study suggests a conserved function for GRX genes in conferring root cell elongation and enhancing resilience of pearl millet to its Sahelian environment. Pearl millet was domesticated about 4500 years ago in the Sahelian part of West Africa and is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops . Today, it is the sixth cereal in terms of world production, and it is mostly cultivated in arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa and India where it plays an important role for food security. However, in Africa, pearl millet yield remains low compared to its genetic potential because it is mostly cultivated in marginal lands in low-input and rainfed agricultural systems and the development and adoption of improved varieties is still limited . The plant root system is responsible for water and nutrient acquisition from the soil. Breeding for root traits that could improve the crop root system efficiency has been proposed as one of the pillars of a second green revolution . Improved crops with optimized soil resources acquisition might be particularly relevant in low-input and rainfed agrosystems found in the Sahelian region of Africa . This strategy relies on the selection of root traits suitable for the specific characteristics of the target environment such as soil and climate but also agricultural practices . It requires a better understanding of stress patterns and the performance of individual root traits in real conditions and in response to different constraints. However, only a few studies have addressed the importance of individual root traits in field conditions. Primary root development is an important contributor to seedling vigor and greatly influences plant establishment . Pearl millet embryonic root system development is characterized by the formation of a fast-growing primary root that is the only architectural component of the root system for the first 6 days after germination ( DAG ) . No seminal roots are present in pearl millet and crown and lateral roots were only observed 6 DAG . We hypothesized that the fast-growing primary root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment . Here, we show that early drought stress after germination is a major constraint in Sahelian environments and that primary root growth is correlated with increased tolerance to this stress under field conditions in pearl millet. Differences in root growth seem to be mainly regulated by changes in cell elongation.

[ABSTRACT] Language is acquired and processed in complex and dynamic naturalistic contexts, involving the simultaneous processing of connected speech, faces, bodies, objects, etc. How words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing is still unknown. Here, the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts was investigated during movie watching to address the extent to which brain responses dynamically change depending on visual context. First, across contexts, concrete and abstract concepts are shown to encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. Specifically, the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when these are processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the underlying neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information. Humans acquire, and process language in situated multimodal contexts, through dynamic interactions with their environment. For example, children may learn what the word ‘tiger’ means primarily via sensory-motor experience: they see one on TV, or they are told that a tiger looks like a big cat. Conversely, the experience required for understanding the more abstract concept of ‘good’ will likely include an evaluation of the rational and emotional motives underscoring intentional actions. Consequently, while more concrete concepts have external physical references ( they refer to objects or actions that are easily perceived in the world ), more abstract concepts do not necessarily have such references ( they generally refer more to cultural and societal constructs or peoples' inner states of mind ) . Is this difference reflected in concrete and abstract representations in the brain during naturalistic processing ? And are these static or can they change as a function of the multimodal contexts in which processing occurs ? Most studies of concrete and abstract processing are not naturalistic in that they present words or sentences isolated from the rich contexts in which we usually process them. Collectively, these studies suggest that concrete and abstract concepts engage separate brain regions involved in processing different types of information. . Concrete words engage regions involved in experiential processing . For example, motor-related cortices activate during the processing of action verbs like ‘throw’ , or action-related nouns like ‘hammer’ , auditory cortices for sound-related words like ‘telephone’ , and visual cortices for color-related words like ‘yellow’ . These results are consistent with the view that we learn and neurobiologically encode concrete concepts in terms of the sensory and motor experiences associated with their referents. In contrast, some studies of abstract concepts have found greater activation in brain regions associated with general linguistic processing . These findings suggest that abstract concepts are learned by understanding their role in a linguistic context, including semantic relationships with other words . However, neurobiological data also support the view that subcategories of abstract concepts retain sensorimotor information as well as social information and internal/interoceptive/affective experiences , which are also important for learning abstract concepts . Thus, abstract concepts constitute a more heterogeneous category . A limitation of these studies is that they have only investigated the processing of decontextualized concepts .

[ABSTRACT] Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy, its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface. As an intrinsic cellular pathway, nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations. We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen, based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts, to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. This led us to design a new SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Most importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases. Despite success with cancer immunotherapies, approved immunotherapies are not available for the majority of cancer patients and only a minority of treated patients realize a durable response . Current studies largely focus on discovering new agents and identifying patients most likely to benefit from existing immunotherapies . While many studies correlate tumor insertion and deletion ( indel ) mutation load with immunotherapeutic response, not all tumors with high indel mutational loads respond to checkpoint inhibitors . The typical adult solid tumor contains a median of 54 coding somatic nucleotide variants, many of which have the potential to create new neoantigens or Mutation-Associated NeoAntigens . Approximately 5% of mutations are insertions/deletions ( indels ) or splice site changes that alter the open reading frame of the transcript . This subset of mutations is of particular interest because they can result in proteins and derived peptides that are foreign to a host’s healthy cells, giving rise to neoantigens . In normal cells, nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) plays an important role in messenger RNA ( mRNA ) quality control, as well as normal gene expression . In cancer cells, however, NMD may aid immuno-evasion by eliminating RNA transcripts coming from genes that carry truncating mutants . This prevents translation and presentation of peptides from these proteins on major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I complexes, rendering them invisible to immune cells . Previous work has shown knockdown of the NMD pathway with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) enhances the anti-tumor immune response . Analysis of cell lines with loss of the UPF1 RNA helicase and ATPase gene ( UPF1 ), a key mediator of NMD degradation, also showed increased levels of aberrant transcripts and mutant proteins in the alleles targeted by NMD . This is reminiscent of the pharmacological modulation of splicing, which has also been shown to increase the number of neoantigens present on the cancer cell surface due to similar underlying mechanisms . Despite early studies showing little toxicity with NMD inhibition, there is as of yet no reports of a specific chemical inhibitor of the pathway with good bioavailability . In this work, we create a cell-based high-throughput assay to query the effects of a curated library of small molecules on NMD function.

[ABSTRACT] Age is the most important risk factor for cancer, but aging rates are heterogeneous across individuals. We explored a new measure of aging-Phenotypic Age ( PhenoAge ) -in the risk prediction of site-specific and overall cancer. Using Cox regression models, we examined the association of Phenotypic Age Acceleration ( PhenoAgeAccel ) with cancer incidence by genetic risk group among 374, 463 participants from the UK Biobank. We generated PhenoAge using chronological age and nine biomarkers, PhenoAgeAccel after subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression residual, and an incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score ( CPRS ) based on 20 cancer site-specific polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ). Compared with biologically younger participants, those older had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer, with hazard ratios ( HRs ) of 1. 22 ( 95% confidence interval, 1. 18–1. 27 ) in men, and 1. 26 ( 1. 22–1. 31 ) in women, respectively. A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel was observed on overall cancer risk, with HRs of 2. 29 ( 2. 10–2. 51 ) for men and 1. 94 ( 1. 78–2. 11 ) for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared with those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge. PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors ( Beta = –1. 01 in men, p<0. 001; Beta = –0. 98 in women, p<0. 001 ). Within and across genetic risk groups, older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer with adjustment for chronological age and the aging process could be retarded by adherence to a healthy lifestyle. This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ; and the Excellent Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province . Cancer continues to be the leading cause of death globally and the reduction of cancer-related deaths remains to be a public health priority . The morbidity and mortality of cancer increase dramatically with age, which demonstrates that aging is the greatest risk factor for cancer . Although everyone gets older, individuals are aging at different rates . Therefore, the variation in the pace of aging between person may reflect the differences in susceptibility to cancer and death. Thus, measurement of an individual’s biological age, particularly at the early stage of life, may promote the primary and secondary prevention of cancer through earlier identification of high-risk groups. Recently, Morgan and colleagues developed and validated a new multi-system-based aging measurement , PhenoAge, which has been shown to capture long-term vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, and strongly predict morbidity and mortality risk in diverse populations . However, it is largely unknown whether PhenoAge can predict overall cancer risk and identify high-risk individuals for potential personalized prevention. To date, more than 2000 genetic loci have been identified as susceptibility markers for certain cancers by genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) . Although the effect of these individual loci is relatively modest on cancer risk, a PRS combining multiple loci together as an indicator of genetic risk has been proved to effectively predict the incidence of site-specific cancer . Recently, we systematically created site-specific cancer PRS for 20 cancer types, and constructed an incidence-weighted CPRS to assess the effect of genetic risk on overall incident cancer risk based on the UK Biobank .

[ABSTRACT] Comprehensive biodiversity data is crucial for ecosystem protection. The Biome mobile app, launched in Japan, efficiently gathers species observations from the public using species identification algorithms and gamification elements. The app has amassed >6 million observations since 2019. Nonetheless, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models ( SDMs ) estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias. Here, we investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on SDM performance. Species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional survey data required >2000 records for accurate models ( Boyce index ≥ 0. 9 ), while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems. Nature underpins human society, and the conservation of ecosystems and associated ecosystem services contributes to the sustainable development of human society, yet these services have been rapidly declining in recent years . The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework ( KM-GBF ) by the United Nations envisions reversing the nature loss by 2030. As direct means for nature conservation, KM-GBF targeted making 30% of Earth’s land and ocean area as protected areas by 2030 ( i. e. 30 by 30 ). As an indirect but influential way, KM-GBF requires companies to “monitor, assess, and transparently disclose their risks, dependencies and impacts on biodiversity through their operations, supply and value chains and portfolios, ” which is guided by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures ( TNFD ) . To achieve these goals, it is imperative to assess the state of biodiversity with a sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to support conservation planning, adaptive management, and companies’ annual nature-related financial disclosures. The basis for such assessments lies in our knowledge of species distributions . Traditionally, distribution data was acquired through on-site surveys by experts ( people have expertise about biodiversity ), but collecting distribution data with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution is challenging if we rely only on such limited human resources . Since the emergence of digital devices and the internet, people have been able to share their observations through various media, such as images and video/audio recordings. Such community-sourced data have significantly contributed to the accumulation of ecosystem information. These datasets have been instrumental in assessing the impacts of climate change and urbanisation on phenology , detecting distribution changes including invasive alien species , exploring large-scale geographic variations in traits , and estimating species distributions . Moreover, the utilisation of machine learning to describe population trends based on community-sourced data offers opportunities for conducting time-series analyses. These analyses can help us understand community assembly processes, unravel species interaction networks, and assess ecosystem stability , capitalising on the spatiotemporally dense sampling effort helped by community-sourced data . Such analytical approaches enable us to make informed predictions about changes in species distribution, population dynamics, and ecosystem stability in the face of climate change .

[ABSTRACT] Abnormal lung development can cause congenital pulmonary cysts, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Although the cystic lesions are believed to result directly from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth, the extent to which developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells contribute to abnormal airway epithelial cell growth and subsequent cystic lesions has not been thoroughly examined. In the present study using genetic mouse models, we dissected the roles of bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 1a ( Bmpr1a ) -mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and discovered that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. In addition, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent process contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic process underlying congenital pulmonary cysts. Congenital pulmonary cysts, resulting from abnormal fetal lung development, cause respiratory distress, infection, and pneumothorax in neonates. The dynamic pathogenic process and mechanisms are difficult to study in humans and few animal models are available. It is known that lung development begins with the specification of the respiratory domain in the ventral wall of the anterior foregut endoderm, as indicated by the expression of Nkx2-1, and the separation of the respiratory tract from the dorsal esophagus. The primary lung epithelial buds then undergo reiterated elongation and division to form the conducting airways ( branching morphogenesis ), followed by distal saccular formation and peripheral alveolarization to give rise to millions of gas exchange units . This well-known process literally describes the growth of respiratory epithelium based on the extensive studies done in the past decades. It is notable that lung morphogenesis is a complex process relying on the highly coordinated development of both lung epithelium and lung mesenchyme. Evidence has increasingly suggested that lung mesenchymal lineages, including airway and vascular smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ), pericytes, and stromal fibroblasts, are as important as epithelial cells in proper lung development . In addition to acting as a mechanical framework that supports the formation of the bronchi, bronchioles, and the distal alveoli, the lung mesenchyme provides a microenvironment that regulates the growth of epithelium through a variety of morphogenic signals, such as Wnts, fibroblast growth factors ( Fgfs ), and bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) . BMPs are a family of growth factors that direct many biological processes, including organogenesis . BMPs bind to the receptor complex of BMP receptor II ( Bmpr2 ) and BMP receptor I ( Bmpr1a or Bmpr1b ), which in turn activates the intracellular Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways . Mice with conventional Bmpr1a gene deletions are early embryonic lethal ( E7. 5–9. 5 ) before lung organogenesis . As reported by us and other groups, both hyperactivation and inhibition of BMP signaling in fetal lung epithelial cells result in lung malformation, which is primarily due to the defects in distal lung epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation/maturation .

[ABSTRACT] Anionic lipid molecules, including phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ), are implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ). However, the role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells is not fully understood, as it is difficult to visualize the local lipid domains around EGFR. Here, we visualized both EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy. The EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ, the EGFR effector hydrolyzing PI ( 4, 5 ) P2. Artificial reduction in the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654. Thus, EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 around EGFR molecules were found to be mutually regulated. Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a receptor tyrosine kinase responsible for cell proliferation and differentiation . EGFR is subdivided into five regions: a large extracellular region, a single-spanning transmembrane I region, an intracellular juxtamembrane ( JM ) region, a tyrosine kinase region, and a C-terminal tail region . After EGFR binds to epidermal growth factor ( EGF ), the extracellular region adopts conformations favoring the dimerization of the transmembrane helices near their N terminus and the dimerization of the JM region , inducing the formation of asymmetric ( active ) dimers of the intracellular kinase region . This dimerization results in the phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the tail region and the recruitment of intracellular signal proteins, such as growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 ( GRB2 ) and phospholipase Cγ ( PLCγ ) containing Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) and/or phosphotyrosine-binding regions . The JM region of EGFR plays a crucial role in the conformation-dependent coupling of EGFR’s binding to EGF and its activation and dimerization . The JM region comprises a JM-A ( N-terminal half ) region, which can form an antiparallel helix dimer, and a JM-B ( C-terminal half ) region, which makes intramolecular contact with the kinase region . Both these JM regions contribute to the stable formation of an asymmetric kinase dimer, which is important for kinase activation. Anionic lipid molecules in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane are implicated in the dimerization of the JM regions . Multiscale molecular dynamic simulations have suggested that phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ) interacts specifically with the basic residues in the JM-A region, stabilizing the JM-A helices in an orientation away from the membrane surface by binding to PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 . In addition to these in silico analyses, our recent in vitro study using nanodisc techniques suggested that phosphatidylserine ( PS ) and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 stabilize the conformation of the JM-A dimer .

[ABSTRACT] Stramenopiles form a clade of diverse eukaryotic organisms, including multicellular algae, the fish and plant pathogenic oomycetes, such as the potato blight Phytophthora, and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis. In most eukaryotes, glycolysis is a strictly cytosolic metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate, resulting in the production of NADH and ATP ( Adenosine triphosphate ). In contrast, stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis in which the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we identify a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocystis that can transport glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. Comparative analyses with the phylogenetically related human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier ( SLC25A11 ) and dicarboxylate carrier ( SLC25A10 ) show that the glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP, such as complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and ADP/ATP carriers. The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP, which powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, as well as NADH, used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules. Given its unique substrate specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism, the carrier for glycolytic intermediates identified here represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens, which are of great economic importance. Glycolysis is a crucial metabolic pathway that most organisms use to obtain energy from the oxidation of sugars, which consists of 10 enzymatic reactions in total, divided into two phases. The first ‘preparatory’ phase consists of five reactions, the products of which are the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The second ‘pay-off’ phase leads to the production of ATP, NADH, and pyruvate, which is transported into the mitochondrial matrix by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier . In most eukaryotes, glycolysis is a cytosolic process with the exception of trypanosomes, where it is localized in the glycosomes . However, it was recently discovered that a large group of eukaryotes, the stramenopiles, have a branched glycolytic pathway in which the pay-off phase is duplicated and also localized in mitochondria . The stramenopiles are an extremely diverse eukaryotic group consisting mainly of protist algae, which are among the most important primary oxygen producers in the oceans . The group also includes multicellular algae ( kelps ) and the economically devastating oomycetes, such as Phytophthora infestans , which causes potato blight, one of the major contributing factors of the Great Famine in Ireland in the late 19th century. The human gut protozoan Blastocystis also belongs to the stramenopiles. Despite more than 1 billion infected individuals worldwide , the public health significance of Blastocystis is debated. Blastocystis is often linked to patients with diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome , or inflammatory bowel disease . However, it is also frequently found in healthy individuals, and a few microbiome studies associated Blastocystis with higher microbial diversity . The controversy may arise from the extreme genetic diversity of Blastocystis, which is classified into over 40 subtypes , and thus its influence on gut microbiota is likely to be subtype specific .

[ABSTRACT] We propose a new framework for human genetic association studies: at each locus, a deep learning model ( in this study, Sei ) is used to calculate the functional genomic activity score for two haplotypes per individual. This score, defined as the Haplotype Function Score ( HFS ), replaces the original genotype in association studies. Applying the HFS framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank, we identified 3619 independent HFS–trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations, corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared with single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) -based analysis. HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway–trait associations and 153 tissue–trait associations with strong biological interpretability, including ‘circadian pathway-chronotype’ and ‘arachidonic acid-intelligence’. Lastly, we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO ) regression to integrate HFS prediction score with SNP-based polygenic risk scores, which showed an improvement of 16. 1–39. 8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. We concluded that HFS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits. Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have witnessed remarkable advancements over recent years, both in terms of sample size and genetic discovery. However, the elucidation of downstream mechanisms and subsequent applications still face certain limitations . One caveat is that the statistical power of GWAS on a variant relies on its population frequency , whereas most variants with large effect size are rare , leading to insufficient discoveries. Moreover, linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) among neighboring variants can significantly inflate false positive results . The variability of LD structure among different populations further compounds the challenges associated with training predictive models and discovering causal genes. Lastly, most trait-relevant variants reside in non-coding regions , which lack direct functional annotations as coding variants. The prevalent approach to addressing this issue is to annotate each variant based on its location within functionally significant regions , such as transcription factor-binding sites or enhancers. While this strategy has considerably advanced the analysis, it is not optimal, as a variant’s placement within a functionally important region does not inherently signify that the variant has substantial functional impacts. The central dogma, proposing that DNA alterations’ effects on phenotype are mediated via RNA and protein changes, offers a new strategy to address these challenges. More precisely, by replacing the original genotypes in association studies with the aggregated impact of variants on transcription or functional genomics, the central dogma ensures the preservation of the majority of genetic information. This ‘aggregated impact’ offers several benefits for GWAS analysis: it provides direct biological interpretations, bypasses the effects of LD and population genetic history, and amalgamates information from both common and rare variants. One successful implementation of this strategy is Polygenic Transcriptome Risk Scores ( PTRS ) , which employ genetically determined transcription levels rather than genotypes to predict complex trait, and achieved remarkable portability. Nonetheless, the accuracy of imputing transcription levels from genotypes, given the sample size of currently available cohorts such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, GTEx , remains limited ( R2 around 0. 1 for most genes ) . Thus, the performance of PTRS is yet to reach its optimal potential. Following the success of PTRS, we made one step forward to use functional genomics in this strategy.

[ABSTRACT] The hippocampus is a central modulator of the HPA-axis, impacting the regulation of stress on brain structure, function, and behavior. The current study assessed whether three different types of 3 months mental Training Modules geared towards nurturing ( a ) attention-based mindfulness, ( b ) socio-affective, or ( c ) socio-cognitive skills may impact hippocampal organization by reducing stress. We evaluated mental training-induced changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity, by combining longitudinal structural and resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis in 332 healthy adults. We related these changes to changes in diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. We observed increases in bilateral cornu ammonis volume ( CA1-3 ) following the 3 months compassion-based module targeting socio-affective skills ( Affect module ), as compared to socio-cognitive skills ( Perspective module ) or a waitlist cohort with no training intervention. Structural changes were paralleled by relative increases in functional connectivity of CA1-3 when fostering socio-affective as compared to socio-cognitive skills. Furthermore, training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output. Notably, using a multivariate approach, we found that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels. Overall, we provide a link between a socio-emotional behavioural intervention, changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults. Stress-related disorders rank among the leading causes for disease burden world-wide , and the global stress load has increased even more dramatically in recent years . It is therefore essential to find ways to efficiently prevent or reduce stress . In recent years, research has shown that contemplative mental training programs can be efficient in stress reduction , while simultaneously inducing brain plasticity . It is, however, still unclear which types of mental practices are most efficient in reducing stress and inducing stress-related brain plasticity. Furthermore, stress is a multi-layered construct , and most studies focused on stress-related self-reports and questionnaires . A less investigated marker in the stress reduction context through contemplative mental training is diurnal cortisol, from which summary indices such as the cortisol awakening response ( CAR ), the total diurnal output and the diurnal cortisol slope are frequently investigated . The steroid hormone and glucocorticoid cortisol is the end-product of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis and a key player in stress regulation . Moreover, cortisol is considered an important mediator of the relation between chronic stress and stress-related disease . Previous research suggests an association between hippocampal structural integrity and stress-related cortisol activity , although findings are inconclusive. To close these gaps, we here investigate the differential efficiency of three types of mental training ( attention-based, socio-affective and socio-cognitive ) on their ability to induce structural as well as functional plasticity of hippocampal subfields and reduce diurnal cortisol levels. The hippocampus has a high glucocorticoid receptor density , making this region a target of investigations into stress-related brain changes. Having a three layered allocortex, the hippocampal formation consists of multiple subfields, or zones, starting at the subiculum ( SUB ) and moving inward to the hippocampus proper, the cornu ammonis ( CA1-3 ), and dentate gyrus ( CA4/DG ) . These subfields have unique microstructure and participate differently in the hippocampal circuitry , likely implicating different functional contributions .

[ABSTRACT] Local adaptation commonly involves alleles of large effect, which experience fitness advantages when in positive linkage disequilibrium ( LD ). Because segregating inversions suppress recombination and helped the maintenance of LD between locally adapted loci, they are also commonly found to be associated with adaptive divergence. However, it is unclear what fraction of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect, and whether the loci within an inversion could still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect. Here, we use genome-wide association studies to explore patterns of local adaptation in three species of sunflower: Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argophyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris, which each harbour a large number of species-specific inversions. We find evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species. This shows that while inversions may helped local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion. While a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation, most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific, indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species. The genetic basis of local adaptation is sometimes highly repeatable, with examples of large effect genes driving responses in multiple species, such as FT affecting flowering time in numerous plants or Mc1r driving colour polymorphisms in vertebrates . Local adaptation can also be repeated for polygenic traits, with significant patterns of similar association found across many loci for comparisons of conifers , maize and its wild relative teosinte , and Brassicaceae , to name a few. While we have a growing number of examples of repeatability in the basis of adaptation, it is also interesting to know if species use different genes to adapt to the same selection pressure. Genotypic redundancy – the potential for many genotypes to yield a given phenotype – is one critical factor affecting the repeatability of adaptation, as high redundancy would be expected to result in lower repeatability . Another critical factor affecting repeatability is shared standing variation, whether present due to introgression or incomplete lineage sorting. In either case, variants shared among lineages are much more likely to contribute to a repeated response than new mutations . Consistent with this, Bohutínská et al., 2021 found that repeatability was negatively related to phylogenetic distance. While we are now accumulating more studies about the repeatability of adaptation, we still have very few examples and much remains unknown about the relative importance of these factors . Inversions have been implicated in local adaptation in many species , likely due to their effect to suppress recombination among inverted and non-inverted haplotypes, and thereby maintain linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) among beneficial combinations of locally adapted alleles . This has been approached by models studying the establishment of inversions that capture combinations of locally adapted alleles present as standing variation , as well as models examining the accumulation of locally adapted mutations within inversions . If there is variation in the density of loci that can potentially contribute to local adaptation, inversions would be expected to preferentially establish and be retained in regions harbouring a high density of such loci ( and this expectation would hold for both the capture and accumulation models ).

[ABSTRACT] Effects from aging in single cells are heterogenous, whereas at the organ- and tissue-levels aging phenotypes tend to appear as stereotypical changes. The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Mammary luminal epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation. We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger <30 ( y ) ears old and older >55 y women. In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1. Epithelial expression variance of gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age, and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells. Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility. Organisms, organs, and tissues exhibit stereotyped aging phenotypes that represent the integration of accumulated, stochastically incurred damages to individual cells that result in commonly understood hallmarks of aging . Stereotypical changes appear directional to the observer and are apparent at different physiologic scales, for example phenotypically though wrinkling, graying hairs, and increasing frailty; cellularly through increasing organ dysfunction, and loss of bone density, muscle mass and fat pads; and molecularly through decreasing levels of androgens and estrogens, and the upregulation or downregulation of gene or protein levels. Age-associated directional changes in transcriptomes of whole tissues are well documented . These directional molecular changes explain, at least in part, the noticeable phenotypic changes that accompany aging. However, although increased susceptibility to a plethora of diseases, including cancers, is a prominent consequence of aging, the emergence and onset of diseases vary among same-aged individuals. Indeed, variance in gene expression between individuals arises in the contexts of tumors, diet, and aging . We propose that this variability among individuals may itself be an important molecular phenotype of aging, and individuals with outlier expression profiles provide an avenue for understanding biological processes that explain the differences in cancer susceptibility between individuals as they age. The breast is an excellent model system for examining aging at the cellular and molecular levels because normal tissue from individuals spanning the adult lifespan is available from common cosmetic and prophylactic surgeries. Cultured pre-stasis human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) support growth of breast epithelial cell lineages from women across the lifespan and enable detailed, reproducible molecular studies of cancer progression . Moreover, there are well-established lineage-specific markers and cell-sorting protocols that helped experimentation at lineage-specific resolution.

[ABSTRACT] Understanding the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance is an important goal in plant science, but it usually requires large and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. Here, we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions. We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress ( Thlaspi arvense ) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, presumably less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid DNA load, i. e., decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also new genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load. Moreover, we found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, in particular differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of Thlaspi arvense, a rising crop and model species, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions. With rapidly increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide, this approach should have broad application in fundamental and applied research. Plant pests, such as pathogens and herbivores, can cause major yield losses in crops and often require the massive use of pesticides to control their damage. Natural plant populations, on the other hand, are constantly exposed to such biotic stressors and their higher genetic diversity often allows these populations to become locally adapted. Since many pest species are sensitive to climatic conditions, their pressure on plant communities is spatially heterogeneous, maintaining geographically structured genetic variation in plant defenses . For these reasons, natural plant populations are highly suitable to study defense mechanisms and evolution of defenses, and also a very useful source of beneficial and resistance alleles for specific pathogens and environmental conditions. This genetic variation in defense-related genes can for example be screened through genome-wide association ( GWA ) or approaches based on known candidate genes . Many pest species are also highly sensitive to temporal variation in weather conditions. This temporal heterogeneity in pathogen pressure can induce plastic responses in plants, involving gene expression and epigenetic changes , which may also be studied through stress experiments . Some plastic epigenetic responses can have a transient stability and be transmitted to the next generations through inheritance of epigenetic marks . In particular, DNA methylation has been shown to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses through gene expression regulation and transposable elements ( TEs ) reactivation, and can be inherited across generations . In plants, DNA methylation can occur in the three sequence contexts CG, CHG, and CHH ( H being A, T, or C ), which differ in their molecular machineries depositing, maintaining, and removing methylation and consequently also in their transgenerational stability . While CG methylation is usually more stable across generations, CHH methylation is less stable and more responsive to stress and the sensitivity of CHG methylation lies somewhere in between .

[ABSTRACT] Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to malaria control and eradication efforts, necessitating the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat this disease. Drug combinations based on collateral sensitivity, wherein resistance to one drug causes increased sensitivity to the partner drug, have been proposed as an evolutionary strategy to suppress the emergence of resistance in pathogen populations. In this study, we explore collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ). We profiled the cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHODH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHODH inhibitors. We focus on one compound, TCMDC-125334, which was active against all mutant lines tested, including the DHODH C276Y line, which arose in selections with the clinical candidate DSM265. In six selections with TCMDC-125334, the most common process of resistance to this compound was copy number variation of the dhodh locus, although we did identify one mutation, DHODH I263S, which conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. We found that selection of the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334 yielded additional genetic changes in the dhodh locus. These double mutant parasites exhibited decreased sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 and were highly resistant to DSM265. Finally, we tested whether collateral sensitivity could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of combination treatment by exposing wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously. This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation which were cross-resistant to both compounds and were as fit as the wildtype parent in vitro. The emergence of these cross-resistant, evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme. Antimicrobial resistance threatens our ability to combat multiple infectious agents, and is widely recognized as one of the greatest public health threats of the 21st century . Globally, drug resistance is a recurring obstacle in efforts to control many endemic infectious diseases, and malaria is no exception. The emergence of resistance in Plasmodium parasite populations and subsequent treatment failure has been documented for all antimalarial drugs in clinical use, including frontline artemisinin combination therapies . Thus, there is an ongoing need to develop a next generation of drugs targeting distinct vulnerabilities of Plasmodium parasites. Additionally, understanding the pathways and susceptibility to drug resistance is important to assess next-generation antimalarials, ideally while they are still early in the development process. Inhibitors targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ) offer an illustrative example. DHODH is an electron transport chain protein that catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate in orotic acid, which is the rate-limiting step of pyrimidine biosynthesis. In Plasmodium, this reaction is dependent on flavin mononucleotide and ubiquinone cofactors and is coupled to mitochondrial respiration. Because Plasmodium lacks pyrimidine scavenging pathways, this enzyme is essential for parasite growth and survival . Multiple high-throughput screens have identified DHODH as a drug target in Plasmodium falciparum , and the triazolopyrimidine-based DHODH inhibitor DSM265 was developed as a clinical antimalarial candidate . While the clinical DHODH inhibitor candidate DSM265 showed promising activity in pre-clinical and clinical studies , we previously demonstrated that resistance to DSM265 emerges rapidly both in vitro and in a humanized mouse model of P. falciparum infection . Resistance was primarily conferred by point mutations in the dhodh locus. In Phase 2 clinical trials with DSM265, 2 out of 24 patients failed treatment due to resistance, with recrudescent parasites harboring mutations in dhodh including DHODH C276Y, C276F, and G181S .

[ABSTRACT] The establishment and spread of antimalarial drug resistance vary drastically across different biogeographic regions. Though most infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, resistant strains often emerge in low-transmission regions. Existing models on resistance evolution lack consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance, possibly due to overlooking the feedback between antigenic diversity, host immunity, and selection for resistance. To address this, we developed a new compartmental model that tracks sensitive and resistant parasite strains, as well as the host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. Our results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant marker data supports this trend. Post discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while it steadily decreases in high-diversity, high-transmission regions. Our study underscores the critical role of malaria strain diversity in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution. Prolonged usage of antimicrobial drugs almost always results in the emergence and spread of resistant strains . The history of falciparum malaria chemotherapy over the last hundred years witnessed a succession of the spread of resistance to five classes of drugs region by region . However, the patterns of drug resistance evolution, such as the speed of establishment and equilibrium frequencies, differ drastically across different biogeographic regions. Even though de novo-resistant alleles are constantly generated, widespread resistant strains can almost always be traced back to two unstable transmission regions, that is, Southeast Asia ( especially the Greater Mekong Subregion ) and South America . While the frequencies of resistant genotypes often sweep close to fixation in these regions under persistent drug usage , their frequencies are more variable in endemic transmission regions such as sub-Saharan Africa . More interestingly, while in high-transmission regions a steady decrease of resistant genotypes often ensues from reducing the particular drug usage , resistant genotypes are maintained at high frequency in low or unstable transmission regions even after the abandonment of the drug for several decades . Plenty of mathematical models have been developed to explain some, but not all, of the empirical drug resistance patterns. Various relationships between transmission intensity and stable frequencies of resistance were discovered, each of which has some empirical support: ( 1 ) transmission intensity does not influence the fate of resistant genotypes ; ( 2 ) resistance first increases in frequency and slowly decreases with increasing transmission rates ; and ( 3 ) valley effect: resistance can be fixed at both high and low end of transmission intensity . Other stochastic models predict that it is harder for resistance to spread in high-transmission regions, but patterns are not systematically inspected across the parameter ranges . Under non-equilibrium scenarios, that is, where insecticides or bednets temporarily reduced transmission, reductions in resistance frequency were also observed . Differences in these model predictions can be attributed to three types of model assumptions: ( 1 ) whether and how population immunity is considered, ( 2 ) how the cost of resistance is modeled, and ( 3 ) whether and how multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) is included. Although the great advances in malaria agent-based models ( ABMs ) enabled the inclusion of more detailed biological processes , the complexity of ABMs limits a direct application to analytical investigation. It is, therefore, critical to formulate a generalizable mathematical model that captures the most important biological processes that directly impact the survival and transmission of the parasites.

[ABSTRACT] Cannabis, the most consumed illicit psychoactive drug in the world, is increasingly used by pregnant women. However, while cannabinoid receptors are expressed in the early embryo, the impact of phytocannabinoids exposure on early embryonic processes is lacking. Here, we leverage a stepwise in vitro differentiation system that captures the early embryonic developmental cascade to investigate the impact of exposure to the most abundant phytocannabinoid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ). We demonstrate that Δ9-THC increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) but not of their primed counterpart. Surprisingly, this increased proliferation, dependent on the CB1 receptor binding, is only associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ9-THC capitalizes on ESCs’ metabolic bivalence by increasing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities. A memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile. These results represent the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit psychoactive drug in the world . In the United States, an estimated 49. 6 million people, roughly 18% of the population, consumed cannabis at least once in 2020, with indications that these numbers will likely increase in the coming years as attitudes and regulations change . In particular, between 7% and 12% of expecting women report cannabis use, predominantly during the first trimester, to alleviate the symptoms of morning sickness . These statistics indicate that a significant number of developing embryos are exposed to cannabis, with limited knowledge of the biological repercussions of such exposure. Among the several hundred unique phytocannabinoids present in Cannabis sativa, ( − ) -trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ) is chiefly responsible for the psychoactivity of cannabis . As a result, the level of Δ9-THC in recreational cannabis has increased over the last 10 years and now commonly accounts for 20% of total compounds . The psychoactive effects of Δ9-THC arise from its binding and subsequent activation of the G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor CB1 largely expressed in the central nervous system . In this context, Δ9-THC exposure has been shown to durably alter metabolic, transcriptional, and epigenetic programs in the brain . While over the last decades, significant attention has been paid to Δ9-THC’s neurological effects, there is also evidence, albeit more limited, of its impact on reproductive functions . Data shows CB1 expression in the male and the female reproductive tracts, in the pre-implantation embryo and in the placenta . In animal models as well as in humans, exposure to cannabis is associated with reduced fertility, decreased testis weight and sperm count, and impairment of embryo implantation . In males, these effects are correlated with an alteration of the sperm transcriptome and epigenome . Epidemiological evidence also indicates that Δ9-THC exposure is associated with long-lasting adverse effects, with exposures in parents affecting the offspring . Despite this accumulating evidence, the molecular impact and mechanisms of Δ9-THC exposure at the earliest stages of germ cells development remain to be determined. Progression through states of pluripotency is controlled by metabolic reprogramming in the early mammalian embryo . Accordingly, cultured pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) exhibiting different developmental potentials are marked by specific metabolic signatures, similar to the ones displayed by their in vivo counterparts in the embryo.

[ABSTRACT] Copy number variation in large gene families is well characterized for plant resistance genes, but similar studies are rare in animals. The zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) has hundreds of NLR immune genes, making this species ideal for studying this effect. By sequencing 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations, we identified a total of 1513 NLRs, many more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of those are present in all wild populations, but only 4% were found in 80% or more of the individual fish. Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population than laboratory strains. In contrast to the massive variability of gene copies, nucleotide diversity in zebrafish NLR genes is very low: around half of the copies are monomorphic and the remaining ones have very few polymorphisms, likely a signature of purifying selection. The innate immune system of an organism provides the first defense line against pathogens. Immune genes tend to evolve quickly and are often associated with a high degree of genetic variability. Many genes and proteins of the immune system are lineage-specific ( limited to specific groups of animals, plants, or other taxa ), while others have defense roles in a wide range of species. In particular, proteins containing a large nucleotide-binding domain followed by smaller repeats have an immune function in animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria alike . In animals, these repeats are usually leucine-rich repeats ( LRRs ) and the proteins themselves are classified as NLRs ( nucleotide binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing, also known as NOD-like receptors ). They have a multitude of functions: some act as pathogen sensors or transcription factors , others are components or modulators of inflammasomes, large protein complexes that are assembled within cells as part of the response to biological or chemical danger . Plants have their own NLRs that are structurally similar to the ones from animals and also carry out central functions in the immune response . Their diversity has been extensively characterized in several species, including the thale cress ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), and vastly different repertoires have been found from different strains or individuals . NLR repertoires can also be referred to as NLRomes, and a species-wide repertoire is called the ‘pan-NLRome’. Most knowledge about NLRs in animals comes from studies of humans and rodents, but their NLR repertoires ( 20–30 genes ) are smaller than those of many other species such as the purple sea urchin, the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica, and many fish . However, even in mice one NLR ( Nlrp1 ) has different copy numbers in different laboratory strains, ranging from 2 to 5 . In many fishes, studies have reported NLR repertoires in the range of 10–50 genes . In others, hundreds of NLRs are present, including in the model species zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) . The zebrafish reference genome contains nearly 400 NLR genes, two-thirds of which are located on the putative sex chromosome ( chromosome 4 ), in a genomic region associated with extensive haplotypic variation . The majority of fish NLRs represent a fish-specific subtype that was originally labeled NLR-C , although they can be further divided into at least six groups based on structural similarities and sequence of conserved exons .

[ABSTRACT] The ovules or seeds ( fertilized ovules ) with wings are widespread and especially important for wind dispersal. However, the earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian are rarely known about the dispersal syndrome and usually surrounded by a cupule. From Xinhang, Anhui, China, we now report a new taxon of Famennian ovules, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. Each ovule of this taxon possesses three integumentary wings evidently extending outwards, folding inwards along abaxial side and enclosing most part of nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule. Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus, and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with less wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two or four wings under the same condition. Since plants colonized the land, wind dispersal ( anemochory ) became common with the seed wing representing a key dispersal strategy through geological history . Winged seeds evolved numerous times in many lineages of extinct and extant seed plants ( spermatophytes ) . Lacking wings as integumentary outgrowths, the earliest ovules in the Famennian ( 372–359 million years ago , Late Devonian ) rarely played a role in wind dispersal . Furthermore, nearly all Famennian ovules are cupulate, i. e., borne in a protecting and pollinating cupule . Warsteinia was a Famennian ovule with four integumentary wings, but its attachment and cupule remain unknown . Guazia was a Famennian ovule with four wings and it is terminally borne and acupulate ( devoid of cupule ) . This paper documents a new Famennian seed plant with ovule, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. It occurs in Jianchuan mine of China, where Xinhang fossil forest was discovered to comprise in situ lycopsid trees of Guangdedendron . The terminally borne ovules are three-winged and clearly acupulate, thus implying additional or new functions of integument. Based on current fossil evidence and mathematical analysis, we discuss the evolution of winged seeds and compare the wind dispersal of seeds with different number of wings. All fossils came from Upper Devonian Wutong Formation at Jianchuan mine in Xinhang town, Guangde City, Anhui Province, China. Details on locality are available in previous works . At Jianchuan mine, Wutong Formation consists of Guanshan Member with quartzose sandstone and a little mudstone, and the overlying Leigutai Member with inter-beds of quartzose sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. Spore analysis indicates that the Leigutai Member here is late Famennian in age . Progymnosperm Archaeopteris and lycopsid Leptophloeum occur in Leigutai and/or Guanshan members, and they were distributed worldwide in the Late Devonian . Fernlike plant Xinhangia and lycopsid Sublepidodendron were found at the basal part of Leigutai Member.

[ABSTRACT] Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) leukemia is a fatal hematological malignancy. Although standard treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have achieved remarkable success in prolonging patient survival, intolerance, relapse, and TKI resistance remain serious issues for patients with Ph+ leukemia. Here, we report a new leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia, and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL. Consequently, neddylated BCR-ABL enhances the stability by competing its c-CBL-mediated degradation. Furthermore, SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity, promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. Moreover, in contrast to in vivo ineffectiveness of PROTAC-based degraders, depletion of RAPSYN expression, or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and, in turn, inhibited tumor formation and growth. Collectively, these findings represent an alternative to tyrosine kinase activity for the oncoprotein and leukemogenic cells and generate a rationale of targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia. Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t ( 9;22 ) ( q34. 1; q11. 2 ) . This cytogenetic abnormality results in a BCR-ABL fusion gene, which encodes the chimeric protein BCR-ABL with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity . Based on its oncogenic role in Ph+ leukemia, BCR-ABL has been regarded as the most pivotal target for Ph+ leukemia therapy, especially for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have been the main treatment option for Ph+ leukemia, remarkably prolonging the patients’ lifespan and improving their quality of life . However, most patients develop TKI resistance and relapse after long-term treatment . It is worth noting that the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of TKI resistance in patients with Ph+ leukemia in addition to the mutations in the kinase domain . Mutations in the kinase domain can change the conformation of BCR-ABL, thus interfering with the binding between TKIs and BCR-ABL and resulting in decreased therapeutic efficacy . In parallel, the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of disease progression and TKI resistance in patients with Ph+ leukemia . Therefore, effective degradation of BCR-ABL could address the issues on TKI resistance and leukemia-initiating cells ( LICs ), and PROTAC-based protein degradation strategy may represent a new therapeutic approach . Currently, based on different ubiquitin E3 ligases, including VHL, CRBN, and IAP, PROTAC-based degraders at nM level have shown significant degradation of BCR-ABL in CML cell lines, cell lines carrying mutations in BCR-ABL as well as patient-derived primary cells containing multiple BCR-ABL mutations . Unfortunately, the excellent cellular activity by the PROTAC-based degraders has not been able to translate to in vivo efficacy, even in rare examples of xenografted mouse models , resulting in uncertain usefulness of these degraders. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory results are not really surprising because the underlying process of elevated BCR-ABL expression remains largely unclear. Receptor-associated protein of the synapse ( RAPSYN ) has been identified as a classic synaptic adaptor protein that binds to the acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) and several cytoskeleton-associated proteins, contributing to AChR clustering and neuromuscular junction formation . Later, RAPSYN was found to exert NEDD8 E3 ligase activity to catalyze the neddylation for AChR aggregation .

[ABSTRACT] Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases ( i. e. lysins ) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development. The discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes. Herein, we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening. As a proof-of-concept, five peptidoglycan hydrolases from the Acinetobacter baumannii proteome ( PHAb7-PHAb11 ) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template. Among them, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr, while the other three were thermosensitive. We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. In conclusion, our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs. Despite decades of concerted action from all over the world, antimicrobial resistance remains a growing global threat today . The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials leads to their accumulation in the environment, eventually increasing the chances of bacterial pathogens to acquire resistance . Therefore, the concept of ‘One Health’ has been proposed to address the alarming levels of antimicrobial resistance . In recent decades, the number of bacteria resistant to first-line drugs, as well as second- and third-line drugs, has been increasing. Some of these bacteria have even been identified as multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, or pan-drug-resistant isolates . For example, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii pose a serious threat and are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in human infectious diseases . In addition, the global medical need for new antimicrobials has not yet been fully addressed. Considerable evidence shows that bacterial peptidoglycan is a promising target for the development of antimicrobial agents with a low risk of resistance development. A well-documented example in this regard are the peptidoglycan hydrolases, also known as lysins, derived from phages. In recent years, lysins have been shown to be efficient alternatives to traditional antibiotics for infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria in various animal models . Encouragingly, several lysins targeting S. aureus have been evaluated in clinical trials . However, the development of lysins targeting Gram-negative bacteria is relatively recent, mainly because the bacterial outer membrane prevents lysins from accessing their peptidoglycan substrates. In the last decade, several strategies have been developed to enable lysin to overcome the outer membrane barrier and directly target Gram-negative bacteria. For instance, Artilysins are constructed by fusion of cationic nonapeptides to effectively eradicate resistant and persistent A. baumannii ; Innolysins are engineered by fusion of receptor-binding proteins to display bactericidal activity against E. coli that was resistant to third-generation cephalosporins ; bioengineered lysin-bacteriocin fusion molecule, i. e., Lysocins, are able to deliver lysin across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and show selective anti-Pseudomonal activity .

[ABSTRACT] Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancer types with poor treatment options. Better detection of early symptoms and relevant disease correlations could improve pancreatic cancer prognosis. In this retrospective study, we used symptom and disease codes ( ICD-10 ) from the Danish National Patient Registry ( NPR ) encompassing 6. 9 million patients from 1994 to 2018,, of whom 23, 592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Danish cancer registry included 18, 523 of these patients. To complement and compare the registry diagnosis codes with deeper clinical data, we used a text mining approach to extract symptoms from free text clinical notes in electronic health records . We used both data sources to generate and compare symptom disease trajectories to uncover temporal patterns of symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis for the same patients. We show that the text mining of the clinical notes was able to complement the registry-based symptoms by capturing more symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. For example, ‘Blood pressure reading without diagnosis’, ‘Abnormalities of heartbeat’, and ‘Intestinal obstruction’ were not found for the registry-based analysis. Chaining symptoms together in trajectories identified two groups of patients with lower median survival ( <90 days ) following the trajectories ‘Cough→Jaundice→Intestinal obstruction’ and ‘Pain→Jaundice→Abnormal results of function studies’. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of the two types of pancreatic cancer symptom trajectories, which in combination can leverage the full potential of the health data and ultimately provide a fuller picture for detection of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer has been predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer deaths, surpassing breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer . It has few and generic symptoms resulting in late diagnosis and poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 11% . Hence, improved knowledge of symptoms and diseases occurring early is of high importance to treat this cancer type at a curable stage and provide better prognosis and guide screening programs for pancreatic cancer . If the cancer is detected at an early stage, where surgical removal of the tumour is possible, the survival rate increases to 42% . The patients with stage I disease have the highest 5-year survival of 83. 7% . Symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often mistaken for signs of less severe illnesses and overlooked in clinical practice. Some of the most frequent symptoms linked to pancreatic cancer are weight loss, abdominal pain, and anorexia . Others include upper abdominal pain, cholestasis, nausea , and dark urine and thirst . New-onset diabetes has additionally been found to co-occur with pancreatic cancer when accompanied by weight loss . National or regional disease registries hold longitudinal data on disease development. The registries in the Nordic countries are of high quality and among the oldest covering treatment in one-payer health care systems . The National Danish Patient Registry ( NPR ) contains hospital diagnoses since 1977 and allows for large data-driven studies to detect temporal disease progression patterns relevant in the context of stratified medicine . Recent examples are the characterization of multimorbidity correlations across cancer types and the detection of pancreatic cancer using artificial intelligence . However, much of the deeper phenotypic patient information resides within the free text of the electronic health records .

[ABSTRACT] The synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindle activity ( 12. 5–16 Hz, adult-like ) precisely during the slow oscillation ( 0. 5–1 Hz ) up peak is considered an essential feature of adult non-rapid eye movement sleep. However, there is little knowledge on how this well-known coalescence between slow oscillations and sleep spindles develops. Leveraging individualized detection of single events, we first provide a detailed cross-sectional characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling in children and adolescents aged 5–6, 8–11, and 14–18 years, and an adult sample of 20- to 26-year-olds. Critically, based on this, we then investigated how spindle and slow oscillation maturity substantiate age-related differences in their precise orchestration. While the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in that it was still nested in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range for the majority of children, the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the adult-like canonical fast spindle range in all four age groups—but notably less precise in children. To corroborate these findings, we linked personalized measures of fast spindle maturity, which indicate the similarity between the prevailing development-specific and adult-like canonical fast spindles, and slow oscillation maturity, which reflects the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance, with individual slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. Importantly, we found that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles actuates precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood. The grouping of sleep spindles into sequences of increased and decreased activity by the sleep slow oscillation during non-rapid eye movement sleep ( NREM ) has been recognized as an intrinsic property of the healthy, mature mammalian corticothalamic system for decades . The joint depolarization of large groups of cortical neurons during the SO up state impinges on neurons of the reticular thalamic nucleus, there, creating conditions that helped thalamic spindle generation . Sleep spindles then propagate to the cortex via thalamocortical projections, where they promote synaptic plasticity through changes in calcium activity . Yet, little is known about how this precise coalescence develops across childhood and adolescence. Far from being an epiphenomenon, accumulating evidence suggests that the synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindles precisely during the up state of SOs provides an essential process for neural communication, for example, supporting systems memory consolidation during sleep . Importantly, canonical fast spindles in turn assort hippocampal ripples , that code for wake experiences and are considered a reliable marker of hippocampal memory consolidation . Moreover, canonical fast sleep spindles themselves are associated with helped hippocampal-neocortical connectivity . In addition to canonical fast sleep spindles, there is substantial evidence for a canonical slow sleep spindle type in the human surface electroencephalogram . That said, previous findings hint at a differential SO-slow spindle coupling pattern and their function is still elusive . Taken together, the complex wave sequence of SO up state and canonical fast sleep spindles, together with hippocampal activity, is considered to provide the scaffold for the precisely timed reactivation of initially fragile hippocampal memory representations and their strengthening in neocortical networks .

[ABSTRACT] Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput technologies, which routinely identify new genes associated with biological processes and disease. Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of genes as research targets have been proposed, their explanatory powers have not yet been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understudied genes remain abandoned by studies that cite these -omics experiments. Conversely, we find that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect which genes are being studied, we find that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes, we condense our insights into a tool, find my understudied genes ( FMUG ), that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. We demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging. FMUG is developed in Flutter and is available for download at fmug. amaral. northwestern. edu as a MacOS/Windows app. We considered 450 genome-wide association studies , 296 studies using affinity purification–mass spectrometry , 148 transcriptomic studies , and 15 genome-wide screens using CRISPR ( see PRISMA diagrams in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 1—figure supplement 3, and Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ). We denote genes that are found to have important changes in expression or associations with a phenotype as ‘hit’ genes. As a surrogate for a given gene having been investigated closer, we consider whether it was reported in the title or abstract of a research article. We determined which genes were mentioned in the title or abstract of articles using annotations from gene2pubmed and PubTator . We used NIH iCite v32 for citations . For determining which gene properties were associated with selection as research targets, we synthesized quantitative measures from a variety of authoritative sources ( see Materials and methods ). We sought to identify at which point in the scientific process understudied genes are ignored as research targets in investigations using -omics experiments ( Figure 1A ). To receive scholarly attention, a gene must travel through a pipeline from biological reality to experimental results to write-up of those results. These results must be extended by subsequent research by other scholars. Understudied genes do not progress all the way through the pipeline, but it is unclear where this leak primarily occurs. The first possibility is that some genes are less studied because they are rarely identified as hits in experiments. Prior studies have, however, shown that understudied genes are frequent hits in high-throughput experiments , suggesting that this is not the case. The second possibility is that understudied genes are frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments but are not investigated further by the authors. The final possibility is that subsequent studies do not continue work on understudied genes revealed by the initial study.

[ABSTRACT] Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides were suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages. Nevertheless, the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood. We have established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ). Utilizing this model, we observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ). The excessively branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of the ECs in the embryos exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further analysis and experiments validated that reduced foxo1a mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of marcksl1a. This study has provided new evidence showing the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms. Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) encompasses a group of chronic diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. Among patients with DM, cardiovascular complications, especially the direct and indirect effects of hyperglycemia on the human vascular network, persist as the primary cause of morbidity and mortality . The harmful effects of hyperglycemia are closely associated with both microvascular and macrovascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease . Endothelial cell dysfunction is a systemic pathological state exhibiting disrupted integrity, adhesion, altered proliferation capacity, migration, tube formation, and more . High blood glucose levels over long periods have been demonstrated to be associated with vascular dysfunction both in vivo and in vitro . The epidemiological evidence has indicated the positive correlation between risks of cardiovascular disease and DM with the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSBs ) and 100% fruit juices, thereby emphasizing the concerns for the adverse effects of sugar intake on cardiometabolic risk factors, regardless of whether the sugar is added or naturally occurring . Artificially sweetened beverages ( ASBs ), which incorporate noncaloric sweeteners or low-caloric additives, have been suggested as healthy alternatives to SSBs . ASBs contain sugar alcohols and polyols, such as sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol, mannitol, erythritol, isomalt, and lactitol. The consumption of ASBs worldwide has gradually increased in recent years . However, accumulating studies in the last decade suggested that ASB consumption might be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes . Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these findings remain insufficiently documented. The zebrafish has been recognized as a valuable animal model for studying metabolic diseases, such as hyperglycemia and diabetic complications, due to its functional conservation in glycol metabolism, pancreas structure, glucose homeostasis, adipose biology, and genetic similarities to mammals . The combination of embryonic transparency and transgenic lines, wherein endothelial cells are labeled specifically with fluorescent proteins, facilitates the high-resolution imaging analysis of vascular formation in vivo. Immersion of zebrafish in glucose solution has been found to induce diabetic complications, including vascular dysfunction . Several recent studies have investigated the effects of high glucose on vascular function in the zebrafish model . However, the association between noncaloric monosaccharides and vascular dysfunctions, such as excessive angiogenesis, has not been explained.

[ABSTRACT] Daily experiences often involve the processing of multiple sequences, yet storing them challenges the limited capacity of working memory ( WM ). To achieve efficient memory storage, relational structures shared by sequences would be leveraged to reorganize and compress information. Here, participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and later reproduced the full color and location sequences one after another. Crucially, we manipulated the consistency between location and color sequence trajectories. First, sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrate improved memory performance and a trajectory correlation between reproduced color and location sequences. Second, sequences with consistent trajectories show neural reactivation of common trajectories, and display spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Finally, neural reactivation correlates with WM behavior. Our findings suggest that a shared common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay, together facilitating efficient information organization in WM. A well-known feature of working memory ( WM ) is its limited capacity , which constrains the amount of information that can be temporarily retained for future behavior. Meanwhile, in daily experiences, memorized items do not exist independently but are always part of a common framework or share the same structure, which could be leveraged to compress information and overcome the WM capacity challenge . For example, while shopping at a supermarket, numerous items could be grouped into a few categories, such as drinks, vegetables, fruits, and meats, to helped memory. Other types of abstract associations such as relational regularities and structure schema could also mediate WM organization . Computational modeling also suggests that higher-order structures ( e. g. summaries and relative relations ) would reduce memory uncertainty by constraining individual-item representations . Cognitive maps, as one type of spatial schema , provide a general structure framework for organizing information in different tasks and across various domains . They were first identified as representations of physical maps during navigation, but recently have been shown to also support other higher-level processes, such as conceptual knowledge, reasoning, planning, and decision-making . Two major neural signatures of cognitive maps, grid-like code , and neural replay in the hippocampal-entorhinal system , are identified in both spatial and non-spatial tasks. Neural replay, the rapid item-by-item reactivation in a forward or backward direction, is posited to not only repeat past experiences, but also reflect an internal model of the world . Accordingly, many higher-level processes could be described as mental explorations of a sequence of states within an abstract map, similar to tracing a route on a physical map. As a result, a cognitive map can serve as a common reference for aligning different features or domains. In line with the view, conjoined cognitive maps have been recently revealed in the rodent hippocampus ( i. e. physical space and abstract task variables ) , and alignment of different feature maps speeds learning performance . Moreover, both spatial and conceptual distances are relied on to generalize when searching for correlated rewards in value-guided learning, supporting a cognitive-map-dependent computational process . Based on these findings, we hypothesize that cognitive maps might be employed to reorganize memory information across domains to overcome capacity bottlenecks in WM. Here, we examined whether cognitive maps shared by multiple feature domains would be naturally leveraged to make efficient use of limited WM capacity.

[ABSTRACT] Mutations in the human PURA gene cause the neurodevelopmental PURA syndrome. In contrast to several other monogenetic disorders, almost all reported mutations in this nucleic acid-binding protein result in the full disease penetrance. In this study, we observed that patient mutations across PURA impair its previously reported co-localization with processing bodies. These mutations either destroyed the folding integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization of PURA. We also solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The observed unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity of PURA indicated that this protein is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity. It offers an explanation why even conservative mutations across PURA result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome. The family of purine-rich element-binding ( PUR ) protein is highly conserved from plants to humans . Among the three vertebrate paralogs PURA, PURB, and PURG, the best-studied family member is PURA . It is ubiquitously expressed and has been implicated in several cellular processes, including transcriptional and translational gene regulation as well as mRNA transport in neurons . Results from two independent knock-out mouse models demonstrated that PURA is important for postnatal brain development . Accordingly, PURA has been implicated as a modulator of neurodegenerative disorders, such as fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome ( FXTAS ), and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorder . PURA was reported to be present in the pathological RNA foci of both disorders and to protect against RNA toxicity upon ectopic overexpression . In addition, PURA was shown to co-localize with an ALS-causing variant of the FUS protein in stress granules of ALS patients. Importantly, overexpression of PURA reduced the toxicity of mutant FUS by preventing its mis-localization . In 2014, two studies reported that a monogenetic neurodevelopmental disorder is caused by sporadic mutations in the PURA gene . Hallmarks of this so-called PURA syndrome are developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, epileptic seizures, and feeding difficulties, among others . Mutations causing PURA syndrome are often frame-shift events but also point mutations distributed over the entire sequence. Based on the crystal structures of PURA from Drosophila melanogaster ( dmPURA ), three conserved sequence regions termed PUR repeats I, II, and III were identified to fold into globular domains . Whereas PUR repeat I and II assemble into an N-terminal PUR domain via intramolecular interactions, two C-terminal PUR repeats III from different molecules interact with each other and thus mediate dimerization of PURA. All these PUR domains belong to the class of the PC4-like protein family, which mainly bind single-stranded nucleic acids and can unwind double-stranded DNA and RNA . Although both PUR domains possess the typical PC4-like β-β-β-β-α- ( linker ) -β-β-β-β-α topology, the N-terminal domain has been suggested to be the main RNA/DNA interaction entity . In a previous study, homology models based on the dmPURA crystal structures were used to predict in silico the effects of PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the structural integrity of the human PURA protein . While these mutations could be classified into groups that likely either do or do not impair the structural integrity of PURA, these predictions remained speculative .

[ABSTRACT] Reports indicate that an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 ( ANO1 ) could be widely involved in water efflux of exocrine glands, suggesting that the interaction could play a role in perspiration. In secretory cells of sweat glands present in mouse foot pads, TRPV4 clearly colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 ( AQP5 ). Mouse sweat glands showed TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases that were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type, but not in TRPV4-deficient mice and was inhibited by menthol both in wild-type and TRPM8KO mice. The basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor. Sweating could be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads, and this possibility is supported by the finding that wild-type mice climbed up a slippery slope more easily than TRPV4-deficient mice. Furthermore, TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis ( AIGA ) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA. Collectively, TRPV4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1, and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4/ANO 1 complex would be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration. Sweating is a vital physiological process . There are two basic types of sweating: thermoregulatory and emotional sweating, in addition to gustatory sweating, largely localized to the face and neck regions, that occurs while consuming some foods, particularly pungent foods . Most sweat glands are of the eccrine type, and they produce a thin secretion that is hypotonic to plasma. Although eccrine sweat glands are distributed all over the body, their density is highest in the axillary region and on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. In humans, the main function of eccrine sweat glands is body temperature regulation. Meanwhile, apocrine sweat glands are found primarily in the axillae and urogenital regions. These scent glands become active during puberty and secrete a viscous fluid that is associated with body odor. Body temperature regulation is important to maintain homeostasis. Body temperature is poorly controlled in patients with hypohidrosis. Meanwhile, patients affected by hyperhidrosis can have difficulty in social and professional situations due to increased sweat production, and the resulting subjective perception of illness at an individual level may be substantial . However, the molecular mechanisms of perspiration are not clearly understood. We previously reported the functional interaction between TRP channels and the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel, anoctamin 1 ( ANO1, also known as TMEM16A ) . TRP channels have high Ca2+ permeability , and Ca2+ entering cells through TRP channels activates ANO1 by making a physical complex, leading to Cl- efflux in cells with high intracellular Cl- concentrations. The Cl- efflux may drive water efflux through water channels in exocrine gland acinar cells that increase exocrine function and causes depolarization in primary sensory neuron that increases nociception. For skin keratinocytes that have relatively low intracellular Cl- concentrations, interaction between TRPV3 and ANO1 causes Cl- influx, followed by increased cellular movement/proliferation in response to cell cycle modulation . Thus, direction of Cl- movement through ANO1 is simply determined by the balance between equilibrium potentials of Cl- and membrane potentials in each cell . The involvement of TRPV4 in exocrine gland function prompted us to examine the functional interaction in perspiration because TRPV4 is expressed in human eccrine sweat glands .

[ABSTRACT] The cerebral cortex displays a bewildering diversity of shapes and sizes across and within species. Despite this diversity, we present a universal multi-scale description of primate cortices. We show that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. As neighbouring folds are gradually merged, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory, that also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species. Our results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of df = 2. 5. Importantly, this new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding, we show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology. We observe a more than fourfold increase in effect size ( from two standard deviations to eight standard deviations ) at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses. Our new understanding may, therefore, generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future. The universal scaling law Equation 1 can be rewritten in a suggestive way ( 2 ) AtA0= ( AeA0 ) 1. 25, where the A0=T2k4 is a fundamental area element that defines the threshold between gyrencephaly ( folded cortex ) and lissencephaly ( smooth cortex ) when At=Ae=A0. For a constant k the value of A0 is a multiple of T2, indicating that cortical thickness determines the size of the smallest possible gyri and sulci. This re-writing highlights a new perspective, or interpretation of the scaling law: it now suggests a relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic measures of cortical size ( given the folded laminar structure of the cortex, areas are the more natural way of measuring its ‘size’ ), At and Ae, respectively, measured in units of A0. This is reminiscent of fractal scaling , where a complex shape reveals ever smaller levels of self-similar detail as it is probed in ever smaller scales ( or equivalently, higher resolutions ), represented here by A0. The scaling, or power exponent between the measured intrinsic and extrinsic sizes is the so-called fractal dimension. Although actual fractals are mathematical abstractions, they can often be defined as the limit of iterative processes. Many structures in nature, and in particular biology , are good approximations of a fractal. Equation 2 is suggestive, but not proof, that cortices are among these forms, with a fractal dimension of 1. 25×2=2. 5 ( the factor 2 being the topological dimension of areas ). Indeed, fractal scaling for various aspects of cortical morphology has often been postulated , with a number of recent papers making use of MRI data . Most recently published estimates of fractal dimension for the whole cortex are indeed close to 2. 5 . Here, for the first time, we propose to directly construct morphologically plausible realisations of cortices at any specified spatial scale, or resolution. This is achieved through a coarse-graining method that removes morphological details smaller than a specified scale while preserving surface integrity. For example, at a set scale of 3 mm, sulcal walls that are less than 3 mm apart would be removed, and the neighbouring gyri would be fused. This method is a new systematic way of obtaining shape properties from the cortex in terms of a sequence of morphometric measurements as spatial scale varies.

[ABSTRACT] The canonical NF-κB transcription factor RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocardinoma ( PDAC ) tumours. In this study, we characterised previously unexplored endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines through live single-cell imaging. Our observations revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA. Through Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA, we predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells, including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, establishing a new negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα. Additionally, we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα. Taken together, we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC. The NF-κB transcription factor RELA is an essential mediator of the inflammatory and immune responses in all mammals and is central to the canonical NF-κB signalling pathway . As a transcription factor, RELA activation is controlled in large part through its localisation. Inactive RELA is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB proteins and IκB degradation by upstream cues, such as the potent inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor α ( TNFα ), enables RELA translocation to the nucleus where RELA regulates gene expression . Live imaging experiments of fluorescently labelled RELA and electrophoretic mobility shift assays have shown that RELA oscillates between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to TNFα . Oscillations are driven by a negative feedback loop between RELA and particular IκB isoforms since the genes encoding IκB proteins are RELA transcriptional targets . The pattern of RELA translocation has been shown to dictate the specificity and timing of RELA target gene expression, including the genes encoding IκBα, IκBε, and the chemokine RANTES . Previously, we showed that cell shape is a regulator of RELA dynamics in breast cancer cell lines and that breast cancer cells with mesenchymal cell shape ( protrusive with low cell–cell contacts ) have higher RELA nuclear translocation . We also identified that RELA activity, coupled to cell shape, is predictive of breast cancer progression . Although the mechanistic basis for how cell shape regulates RELA remains poorly understood, studies have shown that chemically inhibiting actin or tubulin dynamics can increase RELA binding to DNA and RELA-dependent gene expression . Despite frequent upregulation of both TNFα and RELA in PDAC tumours , the dynamics and regulation of single-cell RELA translocation, as well as RELA transcriptional output, are poorly understood for PDAC cells. Here, we used CRISPR-CAS9 to tag RELA with GFP in the human PDAC cell lines MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 and identified rapid, non-oscillatory, and heterogeneous RELA dynamics by live imaging. To explore potential cytoskeletal or cell shape regulation of RELA in PDAC, we constructed Bayesian models using single-cell datasets from TNFα-stimulated PDAC cells with variation in RELA, actin, and tubulin measurements for idea generation: one dataset with five PDAC cell lines and another with diverse small molecules targeting cytoskeletal components. Notably, nuclear RELA was statistically predicted as dependent on actin features across Bayesian models.

[ABSTRACT] A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition ( E/I ) is essential for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are a common feature in various types of neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ). Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog ( PTEN ), the main negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly associated with ASD. However, it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) inputs regulate muscle activity, we found that daf-18/PTEN mutations impact GABAergic ( but not cholinergic ) neurodevelopment and function. This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects observed in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development. Ketogenic diets ( KGDs ) have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances. However, the mechanisms underlying their action remain largely elusive. We found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity, therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants. Our study provides valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs. Maintaining a delicate balance between excitatory and inhibitory ( E/I ) neurotransmission is critical for optimal brain function . Disruptions in this balance are commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders . In particular, deficits in inhibitory ( GABAergic ) signaling have been reported in autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) and other related physiopathological conditions . PTEN is a classical tumor suppressor gene that antagonizes the highly conserved phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase ( PI3K ) /protein kinase B ( PKB/Akt ) pathway. Several reports using animal models have highlighted the importance of PTEN in neurodevelopment . Moreover, mutations in PTEN were frequently found in human patients presenting ASD . The molecular events underlying the neurodevelopmental deficits in PTEN mutants remain poorly understood. The Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) motor neurons regulate muscle contraction and relaxation, provides an excellent platform for studying the function, balance, and coordination between excitatory and inhibitory signals . This system has yielded valuable insights into fundamental synaptic transmission mechanisms . Over the last decade, numerous studies focused on this simple yet highly informative system have significantly contributed to our understanding of the functioning and dysregulation of human genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy, and familial hemiplegic migraine . Furthermore, the substantial conservation of the main components of the PI3K/Akt pathway in C. elegans enhances the applicability of this model system for investigating the role of this pathway in neurodevelopment. We here found that mutations in daf-18 ( the ortholog for PTEN in C. elegans ) result in impairments in GABAergic inhibitory signaling due to decreased activity of the transcription factor DAF-16 ( the ortholog for FOXO in C. elegans ) during neurodevelopment. Interestingly, cholinergic excitatory motor neurons remain unaffected. This targeted impairment of inhibitory signals causes an imbalance between E/I neurotransmission in the animal’s neuromuscular system. In humans, ketogenic diets ( KGDs ), which force fatty acids beta-oxidation into ketone bodies, have been utilized for decades to treat pathologies associated with E/I imbalances, such as refractory epilepsies .

[ABSTRACT] Innate immune responses triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, while host factors including proinflammatory cytokines are critical for viral containment. By utilizing quantitative and qualitative models, we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells. Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions, thus prevents syncytia formation. Notably, in vivo infection experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium. Together, by revealing the function and underlying process of IL-1β on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, our study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection has spread globally, with at least 755 million people diagnosed and the death toll is over 6. 8 million. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron, continue to evolve and increase transmissibility and the ability to escape host immune responses. These variants have presented significant challenges to the design and development of vaccines and therapeutic agents . to discover new strategies to control the virus, it is important to understand host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cell-cell fusion ( also known as syncytia formation ) in multiple cell types including lung epithelial cells, neurons, and glia . Syncytia formation between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with neighboring cells may contribute to increased viral transmission and pathogenicity in the infected host , which also makes the virus insensitive to extracellular neutralizing antibodies . Moreover, syncytia formation among pneumocytes with long-term persistence of viral RNA has been observed in the lung autopsy of deceased COVID-19 donors, which may contribute to prolonged clearance of the virus and long COVID symptoms . Therefore, inhibiting syncytia formation is critical to ensure viral clearance and to control viral transmission. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2-mediated syncytia formation is effectively inhibited by multiple interferon ( IFN ) -stimulating genes ( ISGs ) . However, low IFN levels with impaired ISG responses were observed during early SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have compromised the antiviral responses of IFN in severe COVID-19 patients . Thus, identifying other endogenous host factors that regulate syncytia formation is of great significance for harnessing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Of note, a variety of cells are involved in the host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection . Lung epithelial cells are the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, which then recruit and activate innate immune cells, leading to COVID-19 pathology . In this process, tissue-resident macrophages and circulating monocytes contribute to local and systemic inflammation primarily by releasing inflammatory cytokines . Among these cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2, the combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ induces inflammatory cell death, resulting in clear tissue damage, while other cytokines’ function remains obscure . In addition, when corticosteroids were applied to suppress the inflammatory response in patients infected by SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV , the clearance of viral RNA was obviously delayed, suggesting the importance of innate immune factors in viral clearance. Innate immune cells express Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ), and TLR-mediated signaling induces strong production of inflammatory cytokines .

[ABSTRACT] Insulin plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis. Drosophila insulin-producing cells ( IPCs ) are functional analogues of mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin directly into circulation. To investigate the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity, we quantified the effects of nutritional and internal state changes on IPCs using electrophysiological recordings. We found that the nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity. IPC activity decreased with increasing periods of starvation. Refeeding flies with glucose or fructose, two nutritive sugars, significantly increased IPC activity, whereas non-nutritive sugars had no effect. In contrast to feeding, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity. This was reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application. Contrary to IPCs, Diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis ( DH44PINs ) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional connectivity experiments demonstrated that these DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity, while other DH44Ns inhibit them. Hence, populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Accordingly, activating IPCs had a small, satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity. Taken together, we demonstrate that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state. Insulin is a key neuropeptide that controls metabolic homeostasis across the animal kingdom . Beyond metabolic homeostasis, insulin signaling is implicated in physiological processes underlying reproduction, aging, and stress resistance . When nutrients are abundant, insulin promotes the uptake and storage of energy. Conversely, during periods of starvation, insulin release is downregulated , which promotes the conservation of energy resources and enables energy mobilization via counter-regulatory pathways . Maintaining this energy balance is vital for survival. Accordingly, dysregulation of this finely tuned system is a hallmark of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes . Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a model system to study insulin signaling because of the availability of a powerful genetic toolkit . In Drosophila, 14 IPCs, which are analogous to human pancreatic beta cells, reside in the pars intercerebralis ( PI ) of the brain . These IPCs secrete Drosophila insulin-like peptides ( DILPs ) and are sensitive to changes in the metabolic state , the behavioral state , the circadian time , aminergic and peptidergic modulatory inputs , and other peripheral signals . Consequently, they play a key role in orchestrating the metabolic demands of behaving animals. For instance, insulin acts as a global cue for modulating odor-driven food-search in accordance with the fly’s nutritional state . Unlike pancreatic beta cells, IPCs are localized in the brain and engage in direct synaptic signaling in addition to endocrine signaling. Thus, IPCs are part of a complex system that integrates both neuronal and peripheral signals. As a key hub integrating metabolic state information, IPCs are thought to be part of the neuronal circuitry that regulates food intake , in part by regulating foraging behavior. Previous studies found that octopamine, the insect analogue to norepinephrine, mediates starvation-induced hyperactivity in flies . A subset of octopaminergic neurons expressing Drosophila insulin receptor ( dInR ) are necessary for the regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity implicating that IPCs play a role in modulating foraging behavior. While much is known about carbohydrate metabolism and insulin signaling in Drosophila , the in vivo dynamics of IPCs remain largely elusive.

[ABSTRACT] Endogenous tags have become invaluable tools to visualize and study native proteins in live cells. However, generating human cell lines carrying endogenous tags is difficult due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair. Recently, an engineered split mNeonGreen protein was used to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in HEK293 cells. Using split mNeonGreen for large-scale endogenous tagging in human iPSCs would open the door to studying protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types. We engineered an iPS cell line to express the large fragment of the split mNeonGreen protein ( mNG21-10 ) and showed that it enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the short fragment ( mNG211 ). We also demonstrate that neural network-based image restoration enables live imaging studies of highly dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSCs. This work represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells. Since GFP was first described as a fluorescent reporter , the use of fluorescent proteins has become a standard method to study the localization and function of proteins inside living cells. Generally, reporter protein fusions are transiently or stably expressed from exogenous plasmids carrying their own promoter. However, expression levels can be quite high and variable from these strong, non-specific promoters . Further, over-expression can induce artifacts of localization and protein-protein interactions, making data challenging to interpret . With the advent of gene editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9, the genes encoding fluorescent proteins can now be inserted directly into the genome at a desired locus . CRISPR/Cas9 is used to introduce a double-stranded break at the target site, which can be repaired by homology-directed repair ( HDR ) using a repair template carrying the fluorescent marker . With this approach, the protein of interest is still expressed from its endogenous promoter, fused with the fluorescent protein. This enables the study of proteins at endogenous expression levels and provides more reliable measurements of protein behavior . Endogenous tagging is commonly done in model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for which whole-genome libraries of endogenous tags have been generated . However, gene editing in human cells is less widely used due to limitations in efficiency caused by transfection and HDR, among other issues. Because of these bottlenecks, the majority of human proteins have not been tagged and studied at the endogenous level. Although several efforts have been made to tag multiple proteins endogenously in various human cell lines , the generation of a genome-wide library of tagged proteins in human cells requires higher throughput. The recently developed self-complementing split fluorescent proteins can be used as tools for large-scale endogenous tagging . In the split mNeonGreen system, the mNeonGreen protein is expressed as two separate fragments: a large fragment composed of the first ten beta-strands of mNeonGreen ( mNG21-10 ) and a short fragment corresponding to the eleventh beta strand . The two fragments have been engineered to form a functional fluorescent protein when co-expressed . This interaction is characterized by a high complementation efficiency and is irreversible once the reconstituted protein has folded . Moreover, the split mNeonGreen2 protein retains most of the brightness of the original mNeonGreen . This system allows for easy and efficient endogenous tagging with mNG211 in cells where mNG21-10 is constitutively expressed .

[ABSTRACT] Lesion studies have historically been instrumental for establishing causal connections between brain and behavior. They stand to provide additional insight if integrated with multielectrode techniques common in systems neuroscience. Here, we present and test a platform for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable current and allows for controlled, repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals. Performance of this new lesioning technique was validated using histology from ex vivo and in vivo testing, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning. This electrolytic lesioning method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning. This technique can be used in many areas of cortex, in several species, and theoretically with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost, external lesioning device can also easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup. This technique is expected to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population’s role in neuronal circuit function, while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss. Three main design considerations are required for a technique that successfully combines electrophysiology with inactivation ( further detailed in Appendix 1 ). Neuronal activity can either be temporarily or permanently inactivated, defined as manipulation or termination, respectively . For clarity, termination refers to a technique that causes death of neurons, removing them from the circuit. We non-exhaustively review existing manipulation and termination techniques in Appendix 2. However, none of these existing techniques meet all the above design considerations. Manipulations enable a causal understanding of the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior by studying adaptation to and from a perturbation . Existing manipulation methods include intracortical microstimulation, optogenetics, pharmacology, transcranial stimulation, cooling loops, and chemogenetics. Since neurons remain anatomically and physiologically viable, manipulations can be easily repeated, until desensitization occurs. As termination causes cell death, it can generate stronger causal evidence than a manipulation . For example, even though a transient manipulation of neuronal activity may temporarily disrupt behavior, only a sustained manipulation could elicit the system’s long-term adaption . Over the days and potentially weeks Bundy and Nudo, 2019; Zeiler et al., 2016 following a termination, the surrounding circuitry and broader network may adapt, leading to behavioral recovery and demonstrating that although the terminated region was causally implicated in behavioral control in the moment, the terminated neurons are not themselves causally necessary. A sustained manipulation could accomplish a similar effect to a termination at the systems level, up to the point at which the manipulation stopped. However, it can be difficult to create sustained inactivation with existing reversible manipulation methods, limiting their ability to study the brain’s natural reorganization over timescales of days to months. Termination methods overcome the problem of sustained and consistent inactivation from which temporary inactivation techniques suffer. Therefore, they enable a form of causal inference not possible with temporary inactivation methods . Existing termination techniques include mechanical trauma, endovascular occlusion, Rose Bengal mediated photothrombosis, and chemical lesioning. Prior termination studies mostly measure behavioral output, with no simultaneous measures of neuronal activity during the behavior, impairing their ability to provide insight into the causal connection between the brain and behavior , or with no baseline ( i. e. pre-lesion ) measures of neuronal activity .

[ABSTRACT] Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops, but their populations are at risk when pesticides are used. One of the largest risks bees face is poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides. Studies of bee detection of neonicotinoids have reported contradictory evidence about whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and hence avoid them. Here, we use an assay for the detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ). Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or sulfoxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these solutions contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation. These data provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts, we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops. Insect pollination is a critical ecosystem service. The most economically valuable pollinators are bees , especially domesticated bees that secure crop yield and quality . In agricultural ecosystems, however, insecticides are widely used to protect crop yields . Using insecticides impacts the health and survival of bees, contributing to the recent population declines of all bee species . Hundreds of studies have shown that exposure to sublethal concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides ( i. e. imidacloprid, IMD, thiamethoxam, TMX, and clothianidin, CLO ) in food impairs foraging behaviour, homing and orientation behaviour, and olfactory learning and memory . Most studies administer pesticides in sugar solutions; bees consume the solution, and then a change in behaviour or performance is recorded. If bees could detect and avoid pesticides in food, however, these substances could be used to defend crops against pests without risk to bees. Only a few have explicitly tested whether bees can taste and avoid neonicotinoid pesticides in nectar , but the conclusions of these studies are contradictory. In addition, other compounds that affect cholinergic signalling in the insect nervous system, such as sulfoxaflor, have been proposed as alternatives to neonicotinoids, but whether or not these compounds can be detected by the bee’s sense of taste has not previously been tested. Insects detect non-volatile compounds ( i. e. tastants ) through activation of GRNs in contact chemosensilla on mouthparts, antennae, and tarsi which express receptor proteins that bind with specific types of ligands . When a taste receptor binds with its ligand, this sets off a signal transduction cascade that results in depolarisation of the neuron . For example, several types of receptors tuned to bitter substances are expressed in a specialized subset of GRNs . When these GRNs spike in response to stimulation, feeding reflexes are inhibited . Bitter compound detection is also accomplished by the inactivation of sugar-sensing GRNs . For compounds which are potentially toxic, simultaneous activation of GRNs that directly inhibit feeding reflexes and silencing of GRNs that activate feeding make it possible to form a rapid response in reaction to contact .

[ABSTRACT] Zoonotic disease dynamics in wildlife hosts are rarely quantified at macroecological scales due to the lack of systematic surveys. Non-human primates ( NHPs ) host Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria of public health concern and the main barrier to malaria elimination in Southeast Asia. Understanding of regional P. knowlesi infection dynamics in wildlife is limited. Here, we systematically assemble reports of NHP P. knowlesi and investigate geographic determinants of prevalence in reservoir species. Meta-analysis of 6322 NHPs from 148 sites reveals that prevalence is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia, with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo. We find that regions exhibiting higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots. In wildlife and humans, parasite transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation. By assembling remote sensing data and fitting statistical models to prevalence at multiple spatial scales, we identify new relationships between P. knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation. This suggests that higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity, which would begin to explain observed geographic variation in parasite burden. These findings address critical gaps in understanding regional P. knowlesi epidemiology and indicate that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk. Zoonotic infectious diseases arise from the spillover of pathogens into human populations, typically from a reservoir in wildlife hosts. Anthropogenic land use and land cover change have now been widely linked to infectious disease outbreaks . Such practices, including deforestation, logging, clearing for cash-crop plantations or conversion of intact forest into arable land, are accelerating across tropical forests of Southeast Asia . Mechanisms that underly the association between habitat disturbance and spillover risk from wildlife hosts are complex and occur over multiple spatial scales . In Brazil, re-emergence of Yellow Fever Virus in both NHPs and humans has been linked to areas with highly fragmented forest . In part, an increase in ‘edge’ habitat in fragmented or mosaic landscapes can helped spatial overlap and altered contact patterns between wildlife, vectors, and humans . Such ecological interfaces are also thought to contribute to parasite spillover in other vector-borne diseases including Zika , Babesiosis and Lyme disease , Trypanosoma cruzi and zoonotic malaria . At the same time, habitat fragmentation can have detrimental impact on wildlife population viability, with reduced host species occupancy and reduced disease burden in highly disturbed habitats . Disentangling this interplay is essential to inform ecological strategies for surveillance and mitigation of diseases in regions undergoing landscape change . Zoonotic P. knowlesi is a public health threat of increasing importance across Southeast Asia, following the identification of a prominent infection foci in Borneo in 2004 . P. knowlesi is a zoonosis, with a sylvatic cycle circulating in non-human primates ( NHPs ). Human cases currently occur only from spillover events . Human transmission requires bites from infective mosquitos, primarily anopheline mosquitos of the Leucosphyrus Complex ( Anopheles balabacensis, An. latens, An. introlactus ) and Dirus Complex ( An. dirus, An. cracens ) . Natural hosts for P. knowlesi are typically Long-tailed macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ) and Southern Pig-tailed macaques ( M. nemestrina ) , both occurring widely across Southeast Asia. Currently, distribution of P. knowlesi cases is thought to be restricted to the predicted ranges of known vector and host species , although recent studies have also identified other NHPs found to be harbouring P. knowlesi.

[ABSTRACT] The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To explained how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events, we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida ( conifer ) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana’s breakup, surviving on distant, disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia ( Australian region ) and Proterhinus ( Hawaiian Islands ) have relatively recent origins. The evolutionary interplay between plant-feeding ( phytophagous ) insects and vascular plants has fundamentally shaped terrestrial biodiversity for over 400 million years . The fossil record has provided insights into the historical context and evolutionary processes that have shaped modern insect-plant interactions . However, ( 1 ) the degree to which contemporary trophic interactions reflect those in the past, e. g., representing relatively ancient primary associations versus more recent secondary associations, and ( 2 ) the relative roles of vicariance ( including major palaeogeographical events ) and dispersal in the evolution of host shifts, remain unclear. Gymnosperms ( cycads, conifers and relatives ), the dominant plant group during the Mesozoic Era, thrived from the Permian to the Cretaceous period, dominating most terrestrial ecosystems and forming intimate associations with many groups of phytophagous insects . The transition to the Cretaceous marked the rise of angiosperms ( flowering plants ), which gradually replaced gymnosperms in many ecological settings to become the dominant plant group . This transition was not only a botanical shift but also marks a critical period in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. Angiosperms introduced new ecological niches and resources, leading to the diversification of phytophagous insects and a reconfiguration of insect-plant associations . By the end of the Mesozoic, the continents had rifted into nearly their present forms, though their positions would continue to change. Gondwana split into South America, Africa, Australia, Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent, while Laurasia became North America and Eurasia. On account of their extraordinary taxonomic diversity and varied trophic interactions with contemporary gymnosperms and flowering plants, beetles ( order Coleoptera; >400, 000 described extant species ) have been widely used as models to study the evolution of diversity at the insect-plant interface . The present paper addresses a significant gap in our understanding of the biogeography and evolution of host plant associations in the family Belidae ( belid weevils ), an ancient group of phytophagous beetles whose extant species exhibit specialized trophic associations with gymnosperms and flowering plants. By reconstructing the evolutionary history of belid weevils and examining the dynamics of their host plant associations and geographical distributions over time, this paper seeks to yield new insights into the evolution of modern insect-plant interactions. Belidae, with approximately 360 described extant species in 40 genera and two subfamilies , comprise an early branch of Curculionoidea .

[ABSTRACT] In growing cell populations such as tumours, mutations can serve as markers that allow tracking the past evolution from current samples. The genomic analyses of bulk samples and samples from multiple regions have shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on tumours. However, little is known empirically on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution. Here, we leverage published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas, each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions. Using spatial metrics of evolution, we find that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume instead of at the surface. We determine how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth. Our methods shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology. The evolution of a solid tumour is governed by the division, motion, and death of cancer cells. Genetic mutations arising during cell divisions can serve as cell markers to track this dynamics. From the observed spatial distribution of mutations, it should in principle be possible to infer the spatio-temporal principles of tumour evolution: Is the growth rate uniform across the tumour, or does growth predominantly take place near the edge of the tumour ? What is the interplay between the tissue dynamics of the tumour and its genetic evolution ? These broad modes of tumour evolution affect for instance the signature of neutral evolution, the response to selection, or the number of low-frequency mutants which can confer therapy resistance . However, to answer such questions on the basis of genetic tumour data is challenging because only partial information is available: ( i ) The sequencing depth ( average number of reads covering a nucleotide in NGS sequencing ) is finite. This means that only high-frequency mutations are observed. ( ii ) Usually only a small number of samples are taken from different parts of a solid tumour, which limits the information on mutations present in the full tumour . ( iii ) Longitudinal data from ctDNA measurements are highly limited in the observable range of mutations and provide noisy frequency estimates. Over the next years, some of these restrictions will be lifted by the advent of spatial genomics . These techniques allow assaying the genomic information almost at single-cell level in intact tissue sections. Currently, the attainable sequencing depth is too low to identify point mutations across different parts of the tumour. However, it is clear that the coming-of-age of spatial genomics will bring new opportunities to understand the past evolution of a population of tumour cells from a late-stage snapshot. This implies a need for new tools to analyse spatio-temporal evolution, since standard tools of population genetics, like the site-frequency spectrum, are designed for spatially mixed populations and disregard spatial information. One particular question concerns two different modes in which a tumour can grow; surface growth and volume growth. Under surface growth, the cancer cells divide predominantly at the border with healthy tissue. The potential reasons for this spatial dependence include higher nutrient levels near normal tissue, higher levels of metabolic waste products in the tumour bulk, or mechanical stress in the tumour centre . A faster growth rate at the edge of the tumour leads to a radially outward growth of the cell population. The surface growth mode is well-known from bacterial growth .

[ABSTRACT] Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity. Cacopsylla chinensis exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form, which have distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor CcTRPM regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underling neuroendocrine regulatory process remains largely unknown. Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle. In this study, we report for the first time on the new function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. Firstly, we identified CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β as two typical subunits of Bursicon in C. chinensis, which were regulated by low temperature ( 10 °C ) and CcTRPM. then, CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. In summary, these findings reveal the new function of the neuroendocrine regulatory process underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor. Polyphenism is a transformation effect of phenotypic plasticity, where a single genome produces multiple distinct phenotypes in response to environmental cues . In recent years, polyphenism has garnered increasing attention and has become a focal point of research, such as ecology, evolutionary biology, epigenetics, and entomology. Nature presents us with numerous remarkable examples of polyphenism. For instance, we observe seasonal polyphenism in psylla and butterflies , sexual and wing polyphenism in aphids and planthoppers , caste polyphenism in ants and honeybees , sex determination in reptiles and fish regulated by temperature and social factors , and environmentally induced polyphenism in plants . Undoubtedly, polyphenism plays a major contributor to the population dynamics of insects worldwide . Numerous studies have reported that insect polyphenism is influenced by a range of external environment factors, such as temperature, population density, photoperiod, and dietary nutrition . Additionally, internal neuro-hormones, including insulin, dopamine, and ecdysone, have been found to play crucial roles in insect polyphenism . However, the specific molecular process underling temperature-dependent polyphenism still requires further clarification. Cacopsylla chinensis ( Yang & Li ) is a pear psylla belonging to the Hemiptera order, which causes severe damage to trees and fruits in the major pear production areas across East Asian countries, including China and Japan . This phloem-sucking psylla inflicts harm on young shoots and leaves in both adult and nymph stages, leading to stunted and withered pear trees . Furthermore, C. chinensis secretes a substantial amount of honeydew and acts as a vector for plant pathogenic microorganisms, such as the phytoplasma of pear decline disease and Erwinia amovora . Importantly, this pest demonstrates strong adaptability to its environment and exhibits seasonal polyphenism, manifesting as summer-form ( SF ) and winter-form ( WF ), which display significant differences in morphological characteristics throughout the seasons .

[ABSTRACT] Diffuse midline gliomas ( DMGs ) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 ( H3-K27M ) is a driver mutation in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability. Moreover, transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. Finally, in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors. Diffuse midline gliomas ( DMGs ) are fatal tumors of the central nervous system that occur primarily in children . Years of clinical trials have revealed that conventional chemotherapy is ineffective, and with no option for complete resection, DMG is now the leading cause of brain tumor-related death in children . Sequencing studies showed that up to 80% of the diagnosed children exhibit a lysine 27 to methionine ( H3-K27M ) mutation in one of the genes encoding histone H3. 3 and H3. 1 ( clinically classified as DMG, H3 K27M-mutant ). Numerous subsequent studies revealed pronounced alterations in the epigenetic landscape driven by this histone mutation . Among these global epigenetic alterations are a drastic loss of H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation ( H3K27me3 ), concomitant with an increase in H3 lysine 27 acetylation ( H3K27ac ). These epigenetic alterations were shown to affect transcriptional programs and support tumorigenesis . Detailed characterization of the modes of chromatin deregulation in these tumors pointed toward targeting epigenetic pathways as a promising therapeutic approach . Specifically, pervasive H3K27 acetylation patterns observed in H3-K27M DMGs, along with enrichment of H3K27ac specifically on mutant nucleosomes , underscored the histone acetylation pathway as a potential drug target for this cancer. Indeed, pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi ), such as Vorinostat and Panobinostat, were found to inhibit growth and to restore gene expression alterations observed in H3-K27M malignant gliomas . However, recent studies demonstrated that H3-K27M cells develop resistance to HDACi treatment , stressing the importance of identifying new drug combinations to induce synergistic inhibition of oncogenic pathways. The MYC oncogenic pathway is frequently deregulated in diverse cancers, and thus stands as a prominent therapeutic target . High-level gene amplification of MYC is recurrently observed in pediatric high-grade gliomas . H3-K27M gliomas show high expression of MYC and MYC target genes, due to both epigenetic alterations and structural variants, resulting in a viability dependency on MYC signaling . Unfortunately, directly targeting MYC in tumors is extremely challenging . Dubiella et al., 2021 have recently developed a unique inhibitor targeting peptidyl-prolyl isomerase NIMA-interacting-1 ( PIN1 ), an upstream regulator of MYC activation ( ). PIN1 itself is frequently upregulated in many types of cancers, resulting in sustained proliferative signaling and tumor growth .

[ABSTRACT] The white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus, a long-lived rodent, is a key reservoir in North America for agents of several zoonoses, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and a viral encephalitis. While persistently infected, this deermouse is without apparent disability or diminished fitness. For a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens, the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood by P. leucopus, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus and adjusted for white cell concentrations. Deermice were distinguished from the mice and rats by LPS response profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. LPS-treated P. leucopus, in contrast to mice and rats, also displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics of P. leucopus were also noted in a Borrelia hermsii infection model. The effect was associated with comparatively reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors in the deermice. The results reveal a process for infection tolerance in this species and perhaps other animal reservoirs for agents of human disease. How does the white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus continue to thrive while sustaining infections with disease agents it serves as reservoir for ? The diverse tickborne pathogens ( and diseases ) for humans include the extracellular bacterium Borreliella burgdorferi ( Lyme disease ), the intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum ( anaplasmosis ), the protozoan Babesia microti ( babesiosis ), and the Powassan flavivirus ( viral encephalitis ). Most deermice remain persistently infected but display scant inflammation in affected tissues , and without apparent consequence for fitness . A related question—conceivably with the same answer—is what accounts for the two-to-three fold longer life span for P. leucopus than for the house mouse, Mus musculus ? The abundance of P. leucopus across much of North America and its adaptation to a variety of environments, including urban areas and toxic waste sites , indicates successful adjustment to changing landscapes and climate. Peromyscus species, including the hantavirus reservoir P. maniculatus , are more closely related to hamsters and voles in family Cricetidae than to mice and rats of family Muridae . As a species native to North America, P. leucopus is an advantageous alternative to the Eurasian-origin house mouse for study of natural variation in populations that are readily accessible . A disadvantage for the study of any Peromyscus species is the limited reagents and genetic tools of the sorts that are applied for mouse studies. As an alternative, we study P. leucopus with a non-reductionist approach that is comparative in design and agnostic in assumptions . The genome-wide expression comparison for P. leucopus is with M. musculus and, added here, the brown rat Rattus norvegicus. Given the wide range of pathogenic microbes that deermice tolerate, we use the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) as the primary experimental treatment because the inflammation it elicits within a few hours has features common to different kinds of serious infections, not to mention severe burns and critical injuries . We previously reported that a few hours after injection of LPS, P. leucopus and M. musculus had distinguishing profiles of differentially expressed genes ( DEG ) in the blood, spleen, and liver . In brief, the inflammation phenotype of deermice was consistent with an ‘alternatively activated’ or M2-type macrophage polarization phenotype instead of the expected ‘classically activated’ or M1-type polarization phenotype that was observed for M. musculus .

[ABSTRACT] Caspase ( CASP ) is a family of proteases involved in cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis. In humans, CASP3 and CASP7 recognize the same consensus motif DxxD, which is present in gasdermin E ( GSDME ). However, human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7. The underlying process of this observation is unclear. In this study, we identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. p10 contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination. This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate ( except mammalian ) CASP7. In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primates ( e. g., mouse ) but not in primates. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME. These findings revealed the molecular process of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate. These results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals. Pyroptosis represents a form of programmed cell death that provokes strong inflammatory immune response . Gasdermin ( GSDM ) serves as the direct executioner of pyroptosis. GSDM forms transmembrane pores to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, if these transmembrane pores persist, pyroptosis . Humans have six GSDM ( HsGSDM ) family members, HsGSDMA-E, and HsPJVK . All HsGSDMs ( except for HsPJVK ) adopt a two-domain architecture, the N-terminal ( NT ) pore-forming domain and the C-terminal ( CT ) autoinhibitory domain . Proteolytic cleavage of HsGSDM to remove the autoinhibitory CT domain enables the binding of the lipophilic NT fragment to the cell membrane, where the NT fragments oligomerize and form transmembrane pores to induce osmotic cell lysis . Among the signaling pathways that activate GSDM-mediated pyroptosis, caspase ( CASP ) 1/4/5/11-mediated GSDMD activation is well documented. In humans, HsGSDMD is specifically cleaved by the inflammatory HsCASP1 through multiple inflammasome signaling pathways. HsCASP4/5 also cleave HsGSDMD in response to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation. After cleavage by HsCASP1/4/5, the pore-forming HsGSDMD-NT fragment becomes unconstrained and triggers pyroptosis . Structural and biochemical analyses reveal that HsCASP1/4 βIII/βIII’ sheet forms an exosite that interacts with the hydrophobic pocket of HsGSDMD-CT domain, rendering HsGSDMD cleavage independent of CASP recognition of the tetrapeptide motif FLTD . When the tetrapeptide FLTD is mutated to AAAD, HsCASP1/4 cleavage of HsGSDMD is not affected. The residues that form the hydrophobic pocket of HsGSDMD-CT domain are not conserved in HsGSDME, suggesting that HsGSDME cannot be cleaved by HsCASP1/4 via interaction with an exosite . Actually, human HsGSDME is specifically cleaved by HsCASP3 at the consensus motif DMPD, which is required for HsCASP3-mediated HsGSDME proteolysis. Mutation of either the Asp residue of the DMPD tetrapeptide motif leads to cleavage resistance of HsGSDME , indicating that HsCASP3-mediated HsGSDME activation model is distinct from that of HsGSDMD. It is intriguing that although HsCASP7 shares the same recognition motif ( DxxD ) with HsCASP3, HsCASP7 cannot cleave HsGSDME . The molecular process underlying the HsCASP3/7 cleavage discrimination of HsGSDME is unknown.

[ABSTRACT] Ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression. However, inter-individual variability in response to ketamine is still not well understood and it is unclear how ketamine’s molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects. We conducted a single-blind placebo-controlled study, with participants blinded to their treatment condition. 40 healthy participants received acute ketamine ( initial bolus 0. 23 mg/kg, continuous infusion 0. 58 mg/kg/hr ). We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity and related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets. We found that: ( i ) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting strong inter-individual variability; ( ii ) ketamine’s data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin ( SST ) and parvalbumin ( PVALB ) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not; and ( iii ) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level. These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine. They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry. This study was supported by NIH grants DP5OD012109-01 ( A.

NCT03842800 Over the last two decades, ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) . strong individual differences in response to ketamine have been observed in both healthy controls and patients with TRD . For example, a single ketamine infusion results in a response rate of around 65% in patients with TRD, while individual differences in baseline molecular effects ( e. g. NMDA receptor occupancy ) and brain function predict the degree to which an individual experiences specific acute ketamine-induced symptoms . Despite these findings, an assumption persists within the fMRI pharmacology literature that the behavioral and neural effects of substances like ketamine are uniform across individuals, and that the central tendency can effectively capture such effects. In this study, we challenge this assumption and instead posit that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional, and that these dimensions will capture individual differences in response to ketamine. Ketamine’s effects have been extensively characterised by group studies, which typically involve recruiting a sample of patients, measuring brain activity before and after ketamine infusion, and then averaging the results across the patients ( i. e. relying on the power of central tendency ) to ascertain ketamine’s effects. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine produces transient changes in behavior, perception, and cognition that are comparable to the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms seen in patients with psychosis-spectrum illness . Therefore, ketamine’s acute behavioral effects are typically captured using psychosis-related scales such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ), as well as cognitive tasks .

[ABSTRACT] The RNA world idea proposes that during the early evolution of life, primordial genomes of the first self-propagating evolutionary units existed in the form of RNA-like polymers. Autonomous, non-enzymatic, and sustained replication of such information carriers presents a problem, because product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication speed. Kinetics of growth is then parabolic with the benefit of entailing competitive coexistence, thereby maintaining diversity. Here, we test the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under the constraints of constant total population size and chemostat conditions. We find that large population sizes and small differences in the replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species ( ‘genes’ ), while the error threshold problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification. In addition, sequence properties ( GC content ) and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic parabolic growth could thus have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes. Current knowledge of nucleotide chemistry as well as a large body of indirect evidence from recent organisms support the RNA world idea; a concept that once RNA fulfilled the role of an evolvable primordial informational polymer and biochemical reaction catalyst at the same time . However, the initial weaknesses of the original RNA world idea, such as the lack of a reliable replication process and the consequential loss of heritable information , have prompted scientists studying the origin of life to devise a wide variety of physicochemically refined models of the RNA world. A potentially promising suggestion is that prior to template replication of complex polymers catalyzed by an RNA polymerase ribozyme ( i. e. replicase ), genetic information and catalytic functions were initially distributed among short sequence modules that could occasionally be ligated to increase molecular complexity in a stepwise manner . Replication of these short sequence modules ( perhaps with some catalytic properties ) could have occurred in the absence of a replicase ribozyme, driven by some template-directed, non-enzymatic replication process . Thus, templated, enzyme-free replication in pools of nucleic acid oligomers that resulted from random abiotic polymerization may have contributed to the emergence of structured oligonucleotides during prebiotic evolution . For example, it has been experimentally demonstrated that activated oligonucleotides can act as catalysts for non-enzymatic replication of RNA containing all four nucleotides, with the fidelity sufficient to sustain a genome size large enough to encode active ribozymes . If enzyme-free replication of oligomers with a high degree of sequence variability was indeed attainable from prebiotic chemistry, then it becomes a vital issue how a critical level of diversity of the associated genetic information could be preserved under competition among distinct replicator types with different competitive abilities ( e. g. replicabilities ) . This recognition calls for elucidation of the coexistence mechanisms that could have alleviated the competition among independently replicating information carrying modules. For instance, parabolic growth dynamics, a kinetic behavior observed in non-enzymatic self-replicating systems , has been proposed as an ideal candidate process to sustain a large amount of prebiotic genetic information . In this kinetics, the growth order p is equal or close to 0.

[ABSTRACT] Nonstructural protein 5 ( Nsp5 ) is the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication. Here, we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 ( TRMT1 ), a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications, consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5. Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type human cells, TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA. These findings provide evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic . SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, which includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 ( SARS-CoV-1 ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) . SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the human respiratory tract and lungs, which can clinically manifest as an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Once delivered into the host cell, the incoming positive-strand viral RNA genome is first translated by host ribosomes into two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. Viral polyproteins are then proteolytically processed into 16 mature nonstructural proteins ( Nsps ) involved in the assembly of the viral replication-transcription complex . The Nsps also participate in disrupting host cellular processes and pathways to escape immune recognition and helped viral propagation . The maturation step to release the individual Nsp polypeptides is executed by two viral-encoded proteases: Nsp5 ( also known as Main Protease, MPro/3C-like protease ) and Nsp3 ( also known as Papain-Like Protease, PLPro ) . Nsp3 is contained within pp1a and releases itself from the polyprotein through self-cleavage. Nsp3 also cleaves pp1a at multiple sites to release Nsp1 through Nsp4 . The Nsp5 main protease processes pp1b at eleven sites to release itself and Nsp4 to Nsp16 . Besides cleaving viral substrates, Nsp3 and Nsp5 have also been found to cleave endogenous host proteins linked to the immune response and cell survival . Nsp3 and Nsp5 are essential for viral replication and represent well-characterized drug targets among coronaviruses. Notably, the active component of the antiviral drug Paxlovid is nirmatrelvir, a reversible covalent inhibitor of the Nsp5 main protease . By inhibiting Nsp5 proteolytic activity, Paxlovid reduces viral replication and disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Purification of individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins from human cells have identified a potential interaction between a catalytic-inactive version of Nsp5 with human TRMT1 . A cross-coronavirus investigation from the same group has extended this observation by finding that TRMT1 interacts with a catalytic-inactive version of Nsp5 encoded by SARS-CoV-1, which is 98. 7% similar to SARS-CoV-2 . Interestingly, the same study found no detectable interaction between TRMT1 and Nsp5 encoded by MERS-CoV, which has 66. 8% similarity with SARS-CoV-2. TRMT1 was also identified as a potential interactor with catalytic-inactive Nsp5 using proximity-dependent biotinylation .

[ABSTRACT] Many disease-causing microbes are not obligate pathogens; rather, they are environmental microbes taking advantage of an ecological opportunity. The existence of microbes whose life cycle does not require a host and are not normally pathogenic, yet are well-suited to host exploitation, is an evolutionary puzzle. One idea posits that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence, or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host. An example of such a trait is surface adherence. To experimentally test the idea of ‘accidental virulence’, replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evolved to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. Along with plastic adherence, two multicellular phenotypes— biofilm formation and flor formation— increased; another phenotype, pseudohyphal growth, responded to the nutrient limitation. Thus, experimental selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hyper-multicellular strains. Wax moth larvae injected with evolved hyper-multicellular strains were significantly more likely to die than those injected with evolved non-multicellular strains. Hence, selection on plastic adherence incidentally led to the evolution of enhanced multicellularity and increased virulence. Our results support the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic, ‘accidental’ pathogens. The study of infectious disease often focuses on pathogenic microbes that either specialize in exploiting animal hosts or act as commensals that switch to pathogenesis when the delicate balance between host and microbe is perturbed. These microbes are presumed to have co-evolved complex adaptations that allow survival and reproduction in and on hosts. However, there exists a broad range of microbial organisms that live in the open environment ( i. e. soil, vegetation, aquatic habitats ) that are capable of causing disease when the opportunity presents itself . Such microbes also have adaptations that allow host exploitation, but the origin of these adaptations is unclear, as growth and survival in a host is not a required part of the lifecycle . For example, the soil-associated bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia can infect the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. The existence of virulence traits in environmentally-derived opportunistic pathogens may be due to selection favoring the traits for other uses in the non-host environment, which challenges the idea that co-evolution is a requirement of microbial pathogenesis and virulence. This idea, first proposed and explored in the bacterial literature, is known as ‘coincidental selection’ . Much of the research testing the coincidental selection idea has focused on the biotic environment as a selective pressure, specifically the role of predatory bacteriophages and protists . The relationship between virulence, bacteria, and their predators is complex . For example, a positive relationship between amoeba predation and virulence was shown in Escherichia coli , while selection by amoeba predation led to a decrease virulence in P. aeruginosa . In the same bacterial species, an evolution experiment with both protist and phage predators showed that phage could mitigate the decrease in virulence associated with protist predation . Despite the complexity, it is clear that selection from the biotic environment can strongly influence bacterial virulence. A idea similar to coincidental selection, known as ‘accidental virulence’, has been proposed and explored in parallel in the eukaryotic microbial literature, also with a focus on the biotic environment . For example, in the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, traits that protect from predatory amoeba also play a role in human infection , and selection by amoeba can increase the prevalence of such traits .

[ABSTRACT] Proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains ( PLDs ) are common drivers of the formation of biomolecular condensates and are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations. Here, we exploit the accuracy of our residue-resolution coarse-grained model, Mpipi, to quantify the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins ( hnRNPA1, TDP43, FUS, EWSR1, RBM14, and TIA1 ). Our simulations reveal the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations. These rules are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend across the entire family tested, suggesting that scaling laws can be used as tools to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates. Our work offers a quantitative lens into how the emergent behavior of PLD solutions vary in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules. Biomolecular condensates are highly multicomponent systems with remarkable specificity: they exhibit non-random molecular compositions and, concomitantly, contain distinct physicochemical environments defined by the collective behavior of their components . Phase separation has emerged as a leading process to account for the formation of biomolecular condensates. In this thermodynamic process, segregative ( density-driven ) and associative ( connectivity-driven ) transitions are coupled to produce protein- and nucleic acid-rich phases suspended in the cellular cytoplasm or nucleoplasm . Within this framework, intrinsically disordered proteins/regions ( IDP/IDRs ) have emerged as strong contributors to the multivalency and phase separation capacity of many naturally occurring proteins . Moreover, IDRs characterized by amino acid sequences of low complexity and enriched in aromatic residues, such as the PLDs of RNA–binding proteins , are prone to form condensates that behave like viscous fluids. Furthermore, the PLDs of various naturally occurring proteins, such as Fused in Sarcoma ( FUS ), Trans-activation response DNA-binding protein 43 ( TDP-43 ), and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 ( hnRNPA1 ) have been reported to transition from liquid-like condensates into dynamically arrested solids and glasses over time . Such arrested states have been postulated as precursors of pathological protein aggregates and amyloids . Understanding the molecular factors that regulate the ability of PLDs to phase separate is of crucial importance, as these are conjectured to also helped their aggregation . Biomolecular condensates are networked fluids sustained by multivalent macromolecules that interconnect with more than two partners simultaneously . Thus, the factors that increase the molecular valency, give rise to more densely connected liquid networks, and more stable condensates . For PLDs, multivalency has been shown to be strongly promoted by the presence of aromatic residues, which act as ‘stickers’ that enable associative π–π interactions, and also cation–π contacts with arginine and lysine . Indeed, the range of the coexistence of PLD condensates has been shown to change most significantly in response to mutations involving aromatic residues . Quantitative experimental phase diagrams for a set of hnRNPA1-IDR variants in combination with mean-field simulations demonstrated that tyrosine drives stronger associative interactions than phenylalanine, arginine’s effects are context-specific, and lysine destabilizes PLD–PLD interactions . More importantly, such a study demonstrates that, at least for hnRNPA1, there exist quantitative rules that explain the changes in thermodynamic parameters of condensates in response to precise amino-acid sequence mutations.

[ABSTRACT] Predicting an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience. This is commonly done using either structural aspects, such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness, or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time. But these approaches are missing a central aspect of brain function: the unique ways in which an individual’s brain activity unfolds over time. One reason why these dynamic patterns are not usually considered is that they have to be described by complex, high-dimensional models; and it is unclear how best to use these models for prediction. We here propose an approach that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) and combines it with the Fisher kernel, which can be used to predict individual traits. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner, thereby preserving the structure of the underlying model. We show here, in fMRI data, that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach is accurate and reliable. We compare the Fisher kernel to other prediction methods, both time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models. Our approach leverages information about an individual’s time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalised medicine. Observing a person’s behaviour over time is how we understand the individual’s personality, cognitive traits, or psychiatric condition. The same should apply at the brain level, where we may be able to gain crucial insights by observing the patterns in which brain activity unfolds over time, that is brain dynamics. One way of describing brain dynamics are state-space models, which allow capturing recurring patterns of activity and functional connectivity ( FC ) across the whole brain. However, although research into brain dynamics has recently gained traction , it is still unclear how best to use this spatiotemporal level of description to characterise subject differences or predict individual traits from brain signals. One reason why brain dynamics are not usually considered in this context pertains to their representation: They are represented using models of varying complexity that are estimated from modalities such as functional MRI or MEG. Although there exists a variety of methods for estimating time-varying or dynamic FC , like the commonly used sliding-window approach, there is currently no widely accepted way of using them for prediction problems. This is because these models are usually parametrised by a high number of parameters with complex mathematical relationships between the parameters that reflect the model assumptions. How to leverage these parameters for prediction is currently an open question. We here propose the Fisher kernel for predicting individual traits from brain dynamics, using information from generative models that do not assume any knowledge of task timings. We focus on models of brain dynamics that capture within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from fMRI scans, in this case acquired during wakeful rest, and how the parameters from these models can be used to predict behavioural variables or traits. In particular, we use the Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ), which is a probabilistic generative model of time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity ( FC ) dynamics . HMMs have previously been shown to be able to predict certain complex subject traits, such as fluid intelligence, more accurately than structural or static ( time-averaged ) FC representations .

[ABSTRACT] Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) variants associated with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) and Crohn’s disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates. While it has been recently shown that perturbations in cellular homeostasis including lysosomal damage can increase LRRK2 activity and localization to lysosomes, the molecular mechanisms by which LRRK2 activity is regulated have remained poorly defined. We performed a targeted siRNA screen to identify regulators of LRRK2 activity and identified Rab12 as a new modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes, we demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes and leads to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation. PD-linked variants, including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10. Together, these data suggest a conserved process by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrate ( s ) at the lysosome. Coding variants in LRRK2 can cause monogenic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ), and coding and non-coding variants in LRRK2 are associated with increased risk for developing sporadic PD and Crohn’s disease . The majority of pathogenic LRRK2 variants cluster within its Roc-COR ( Ras of complex proteins/C-terminal of Roc ) GTPase tandem domain or kinase domain and contribute to disease risk by ultimately increasing LRRK2’s kinase activity . LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases, including Rab10 and Rab12. Excessive Rab phosphorylation can perturb interactions between Rabs and downstream effectors, which impairs various aspects of membrane trafficking including lysosomal function . LRRK2 localizes primarily to the cytosol in an inactive state, and higher-order oligomerization and membrane recruitment appear to be required for LRRK2 activation and Rab phosphorylation . Recent work suggests that interactions between LRRK2 and its phosphorylated Rab substrates help maintain LRRK2 on membranes and result in a cooperative, feed-forward process to promote additional Rab phosphorylation . However, it is not clear what mechanisms promote the initial recruitment of LRRK2 to membranes to trigger Rab phosphorylation or whether increased LRRK2 membrane association is a common driver of the elevated LRRK2 activity observed in PD. Endolysosomal genes that modify PD risk and lysosomal damage can also increase LRRK2 activation and phosphorylation of its Rab substrates . Rab29 and the retromer subunit VPS35, proteins that are genetically associated with PD and play key roles in lysosomal function by regulating sorting between the endolysosomal system and the trans-Golgi network, can modulate LRRK2 activity, as overexpression of Rab29 or expression of the pathogenic VPS35 D620N variant lead to significantly elevated LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and other Rab substrates . LRRK2 kinase activity also appears to be increased in nonhereditary idiopathic PD patients , and emerging data suggest that lysosomal damage more broadly may be a common trigger for LRRK2 activation. Lysosomotropic agents that disrupt the endolysosomal pH gradient or puncture lysosomal membranes enhance LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes and result in increased Rab10 phosphorylation . Several hypotheses around the purpose of LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes have been proposed, including promotion of lysosomal membrane repair or clearance of lysosomal content through exocytosis or sorting of vesicles away from damaged lysosomes .

[ABSTRACT] Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research. While current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, non-adherent cells remain challenging. In this study, we addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells. This method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics, and we tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. Our cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells. Cell cycle dynamics coordinate cellular division and proliferation through regulating the different cell cycle phases. Dysregulation in these processes is a hallmark of malignancies such as human cancer, where aberrant activities in cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ), cyclins, and CDK inhibitors often drive uncontrolled proliferation. Consequently, targeting cell cycle components has emerged as a pivotal therapeutic strategy, especially crucial in preclinical drug evaluation . Traditional methods for assessing cell cycle dynamics have been largely dependent on the quantification of DNA content through flow or image cytometry, providing a static snapshot of cell populations in various cycle phases . Although valuable, these techniques fall short in capturing intra-population variability and require additional protein markers for precise phase determination . Methods utilizing cells expressing fluorescently labeled reporters and time-lapse microscopy can discriminate cell cycle phases at the level of individual cells, thereby offering valuable insights into the variability of cell cycle and cell cycle phase durations within the overall cell population . Advanced imaging methods, such as time-lapse microscopy coupled with fluorescently tagged reporters, have shown promise in detailing cell cycle dynamics at the single-cell level. Technologies like the Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator ( FUCCI ) have been employed for this, effectively demarcating cell cycle phases through color-coding . FUCCI ( CA ) 2 express the hCdt1 ( 1/100 ) fused to mCherry fluorescent protein and hGem ( 1/110 ) fused to mVenus, generating a clear and distinct tricolor demarcation, separating G1 ( red ), S ( green ), and G2/M phases ( yellow ) . This dynamic insight is particularly crucial in the context of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ), where chromosomal translocations generate fusion genes that disrupt cellular differentiation programs and drive proliferation . The described experimental setup utilizes nanostructured titanium oxide-coated multiwell plates relying on the technology used in the commercially available Smart BioSurface ( SBS ) slides . Such technology should hypothetically enable us to immobilize non-adherent cells for extended imaging durations. To overcome the limitations of manual data analysis, we introduce an automated image analysis pipeline for time-lapse videos of AML cell lines, exploiting a FUCCI-based probe for visualization. Our data analysis approach combines custom image processing, TrackMate-based cell tracking, and machine learning-based track filtering, thereby automating the entire data analysis workflow. In summary, we present a comprehensive, experimental protocol for cell cycle analysis in adherent and non-adherent cells ( summarized in Box 1 ).

[ABSTRACT] The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains both a fascinating and a controversial issue. Recent comparative studies provided conflicting results regarding the contribution of social vs ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition. Here, we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology. Using brain imaging data from 16 primate species, we measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole ( FP ) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ), respectively, involved in metacognition and working memory, and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables. The size of these prefrontal regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily traveled distance ( an index of ecological constraints ), and population density ( an index of social constraints ). The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Interestingly, FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions. Thus, our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates. Numerous studies have addressed the mechanisms underlying the evolution of cognitive abilities in primates, using brain size as a proxy . One of the major hypotheses, referred to as the ‘social brain’ idea, proposes that social interactions require higher cognitive skills such that the complexity of social interactions played a central role in the increase in brain size during primate evolution . Another major theory, referred to as the ‘ecological brain’ idea, proposes that the increase in brain size and corresponding cognitive skills was driven by the need to build mental representations to forage efficiently . Critically, both of these theories are based on the assumption that the whole brain volume is a good proxy for overall cognitive abilities, and that these global abilities can benefit social interactions or foraging, across species in an evolutionary framework. But clearly, the level of precision of such neuro-cognitive scenario remains limited, given the precision with which neuroscience and psychology have characterized the brain functional anatomy and cognition, respectively. Imaging studies in humans have identified a network of brain regions involved in social interactions, and this network is often referred to as the social brain . Recent comparative studies have shown that it also existed in macaques . Along the same lines, laboratory studies have proposed that specific brain regions ( e. g. cingulate cortex ) were underlying foraging in humans and macaques . These studies, however, have only been conducted in a handful of species and in very artificial conditions, such that the relation between these brain regions and natural behavior or evolution remains elusive. In terms of the cognitive processes involved, ‘social interactions’ and ‘foraging’ remain poorly specific and they probably involve myriads of more elementary cognitive operations. For example, social interactions involve some form of categorization of facial expressions and metacognition, and the brain regions associated with these elementary cognitive operations ( e. g. frontal pole or temporo-parietal junction ) are usually part of the ‘social brain’, i. e., the set of brain regions associated with social interactions .

[ABSTRACT] An increase in mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise, induces radial growth of muscle fibers ( i. e. an increase in cross-sectional area ). Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils, but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils ( i. e. myofibril hypertrophy ) and/or the number of myofibrils ( i. e. myofibrillogenesis ) is not known. Electron microscopy ( EM ) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question, but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process. To overcome this, we developed a new method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope ( fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution [FIM-ID] ). Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. After extensively validating the automated measurements, we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Collectively, the outcomes of this study offer insight into a fundamentally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it. Comprising ~45% of the body’s mass, skeletal muscles are not only the motors that drive locomotion, but they also play a critical role in respiration, whole-body metabolism, and maintaining a high quality of life . Indeed, both sedentary and active adults will lose 30–40% of their muscle mass by the age of 80, and this loss in muscle mass is associated with disability, loss of independence, an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, as well as an estimated $40 billion in annual hospitalization costs in the United States alone . Thus, the development of therapies that can restore, maintain, and/or increase muscle mass is of great clinical and fiscal significance. However, to develop such therapies, we will first need to define the basic mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle mass. Skeletal muscle mass can be regulated by a variety of different stimuli with one of the most widely recognized being mechanical signals . For instance, a plethora of studies have shown that an increase in mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise ( RE ), can induce radial growth of the muscle fibers . Surprisingly, however, the ultrastructural adaptations that drive this response have not been well defined . Indeed, a number of seemingly simple and fundamental important questions have not been answered. For instance, during radial growth, the cross-sectional area ( CSA ) of the muscle fiber increases, but whether this is mediated by an increase in the CSA of the individual myofibrils ( i. e. myofibril hypertrophy ) and/or the number of myofibrils ( i. e. myofibrillogenesis ) has not been resolved . A longstanding model in the field proposes that the radial growth of muscle fibers can be explained by a process called ‘myofibril splitting’ . The myofibril splitting model was developed by Goldspink in the 1970s and contends that, during radial growth, myofibrils initially undergo hypertrophy. Then, as the CSA of the myofibrils increases, the outward radial force that they exert on the Z-disc increases.

[ABSTRACT] SNAP25 is one of three neuronal SNAREs driving synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We studied three mutations in SNAP25 that cause epileptic encephalopathy: V48F, and D166Y in the synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 ) -binding interface, and I67N, which destabilizes the SNARE complex. All three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and when expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons. The V48F and D166Y mutants ( with potency D166Y > V48F ) led to reduced readily releasable pool ( RRP ) size, due to increased spontaneous ( miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Current, mEPSC ) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased the release probability, which are gain-of-function features not found in Syt1 knockout ( KO ) neurons; normalized mEPSC release rates were higher ( potency D166Y > V48F ) than in the Syt1 KO. These mutations ( potency D166Y > V48F ) increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs, resulting in unregulated membrane fusion. In contrast, the I67N mutant decreased mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes due to an increase in the height of the energy barrier for fusion, whereas the RRP size was unaffected. This could be partly compensated by positive charges lowering the energy barrier. Overall, pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion. The fusion machinery responsible for chemical synaptic transmission is well known: it consists of the SNARE complex, a ternary complex formed by the proteins VAMP2, syntaxin-1, and SNAP25 . This complex is under tight control by upstream partner protein Munc18-1, which acts as a template for SNARE complex formation, and Munc13s, which assist in the transitions required along the pathway of assembly . SNARE complexes assemble in a zipper-like manner; partially assembled SNAREpins bind synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 ) and complexin within two separate interaction sites: the primary interface formed between a synaptotagmin-1 molecule and syntaxin-1 and SNAP25 , and the tripartite interface formed by syntaxin-1 and VAMP2 with another Syt1 molecule and complexin . Upon arrival of an action potential, Ca2+ binds to the two C2 domains of Syt1, which results in rapid vesicle–plasma membrane fusion and release of neurotransmitter within a fraction of a millisecond . The strong functional integration and specialization of the neuronal SNARE for speed have rendered the release machinery exquisitely susceptible to insults. De novo mutations in SNAREs and associated proteins lead to complex neurological disease, characterized by drug-resistant epilepsy, intellectual disability, movement disorders, and often autism; a syndrome which has been denoted ‘SNAREopathy’ . Although rare, these are devastating conditions for the patients and their families. Consequently, there is considerable interest in revealing the molecular/cellular mechanisms for these conditions, which is seen as key to the development of treatment. Disease-causing mutations in the SNARE-machinery fall into distinct categories according to the nature of the defect . These include different forms of haploinsufficiency, where the mutated protein is either lost altogether or has lost its functionality, and dominant-negative or recessive variants, as well as variants with new or changed protein interactions, referred to as neomorphs. Most SNAREopathy mutations have been described in STXBP1 , the gene encoding Munc18-1. These mutations are generally found to cause Munc18-1 hypo-expression, probably due to protein instability , and thus the mutations belong in the haploinsufficiency category.

[ABSTRACT] We use data from 30 countries and find that the more women in a discipline, the lower quality the research in that discipline is evaluated to be and the lower the funding success rate is. This affects men and women, and is strong to age, number of research outputs, and bibliometric measures where such data are available. Our work builds on others’ findings that women’s work is valued less, regardless of who performs that work. Many have observed that women’s research is evaluated as lower quality than men’s research . And apart from a few exceptions , most analyses show that women’s funding success rates are lower than men’s both in terms of number of grants and size of grants . Evaluations of research quality affect many aspects of an academic career, from hiring and promotion decisions to funding success. Other studies have explored possible explanations for this seemingly gendered pattern in evaluation of research quality, such as societal , institutional , and academic factors , including gender bias . We find a strong correlation between the evaluated quality of a researcher’s work and the gender balance of the researcher’s discipline. Researchers, both male and female, in female-dominated disciplines receive lower evaluations. This finding is strong to bibliometric differences across disciplines. We also find that funding success rates display a similar correlation. Applications from researchers, both male and female, in female-dominated disciplines have lower success rates. Academic disciplines can be quite different to one another in ways such as publication rates , citation rates , and expected h-indices . There are different norms for the expected number of co-authors , order of authors, and attributions . Gender balance is not constant across disciplines either. There are fewer women in STEM subjects, and more women than men use qualitative methods, rather than quantitative, in research . Recent research suggests there are interactions between individual- and discipline-level characteristics. Higher ‘expectations of brilliance’ in a discipline is related to a lower proportion of women entering Leslie et al., 2015; and research area is a strong contributor to the lower funding success rates of African American/Black scientists . That women score lower on evaluations of research quality is not surprising. On an individual level, women publish less than men , receive fewer citations , and have lower h-indices . Women have fewer first authorships and are less likely to receive acknowledgement . Women are also less likely to get credit for their innovations and awards, particularly prestigious ones, are less likely to be given to women .

We use independent datasets spanning thousands of researchers and 30 countries and look separately at research funding success rates and holistic research quality scores. Where possible we account for researcher characteristics like age, research institution, and publishing patterns. We consistently find that researchers in male-dominated disciplines have both higher funding success rates, and higher research quality scores, than researchers in female-dominated disciplines. This applies to both men and women. First, we look at the only country that scores all individual university researchers.

[ABSTRACT] One of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy termed ‘P3 editing’, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells. Interactions among genes, proteins, and other biomolecules form molecular circuits that process information. Endogenous molecular circuits are composed of different functional modules that can sense, transmit, or integrate various events experienced by cells as inputs. The processed information is used to direct cellular processes, often by altering the expression of specific genes or by inducing chemical modifications to existing molecules ( e. g. phosphorylation cascades ). One of the goals of the field of synthetic biology is to augment the endogenous molecular circuitry with synthetic components that process-specific input signal ( s ) to desired output ( s ) in a predictable fashion . For example, various synthetic circuits have been built to modulate gene expression or post-translational modifications, in response to a wide range of input signals such as the presence of specific small molecules . Genome editing is a potentially attractive output for synthetic molecular circuits. Changes in the genome ( or epigenome ) can alter the expression of specific genes, unlock the synthesis of specific proteins, or simply serve as a record of past events stably etched into genomic DNA . In nature, targeted alterations of genomic DNA are used to record exposure to specific pathogens ( e. g. CRISPR ) or to generate diversity in recognition molecules that discriminate self from non-self ( e. g. antibodies ). In particular, the CRISPR system for immune response in bacteria has been repurposed as a programmable genome editing method . Since its initial use for genome editing via a programmable nuclease, various genome and epigenome editing methods have been developed that leverage the CRISPR-Cas9 protein as an integral component. Modifications of the Cas9 protein have helped more precise genome editing ( e. g. base editing, prime editing ) or epigenetic control of gene expression ( e. g. CRISPRa, CRIPSRi ) . A critical feature of CRISPR-based genome editing is its straightforward programmability, as the CRISPR guide RNA ( gRNA ) molecule alone can specifically program the genomic location to be edited. Prime editing extends this advantage via a prime editing guide RNA ( pegRNA ) that programs both the target locus and editing outcome. However, to fully realize CRISPR’s potential in synthetic molecular circuits, we also require machinery that transduces molecular events into genome editing events.

[ABSTRACT] In cardiomyocytes, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current ( IKs ), pivotal during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. Mutations in IKs cause long QT syndrome ( LQTS ), a syndrome with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG, which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. One potential therapeutical intervention for LQTS is based on targeting IKs channels to restore channel function and/or the physiological QT interval. Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) are potent activators of KCNQ1 channels and activate IKs channels by binding to two different sites, one in the voltage sensor domain – which shifts the voltage dependence to more negative voltages – and the other in the pore domain – which increases the maximal conductance of the channels ( Gmax ). However, the process by which PUFAs increase the Gmax of the IKs channels is still poorly understood. In addition, it is unclear why IKs channels have a very small single-channel conductance and a low open probability or whether PUFAs affect any of these properties of IKs channels. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability, and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state. The voltage-gated K+ channel KCNQ1, also referred to as Kv7. 1, is expressed in the heart. Here the channel associates with the accessory KCNE1 subunit, generating the so-called slow delayed-rectifier ( IKs ) current, an important contributor to the repolarizing phase of the ventricular action potential ( AP ) . Loss-of-function mutations of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex are associated with long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) . These LQTS mutations cause a reduction of the channel current, leading to a significant prolongation of the ventricular AP waveform that can be seen on the electrocardiogram as a prolonged QT interval . These channel mutations, or dysfunction, increase the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to sudden cardiac death . At present, treatment of LQTS is mainly based on the usage of β-blockers ( most used are long-lasting preparations such as nadolol and atenolol ) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, especially for patients with high risk of sudden death and frequent syncope . However, both approaches do not shorten the QT interval duration. Restoring the physiological duration of the QT interval could be achieved by increasing the activity of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex . Like other Kv channels, KCNQ1 has a typical tetrameric structure of four α-subunits. Each α-subunit is composed of six transmembrane segments, with S1-S4 forming the voltage sensor domain ( VSD ) and S5-S6 forming the pore domain ( PD ) ( Figure 1D ). However, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex has a very small single-channel conductance and a very low open probability compared to other Kv channels . The mechanisms behind the small conductance and low open probability are not understood. Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ), in particular omega 3, are known to exert a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in the diet at least twice a week . PUFAs have been shown to increase IKs currents by a dual process of action, characteristically described as a ‘Lipoelectric process’ . According to this process, PUFAs can increase IKs currents by shifting the voltage dependence of activation ( ΔV0.

[ABSTRACT] Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades. Still, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well. Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase ( PDXP ), an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate ( PLP ), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, we discover, visualize, and analyze 7, 8-dihydroxyflavone ( 7, 8-DHF ) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7, 8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7, 8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Of note, 7, 8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its process of action is actively debated. Our discovery of 7, 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers new mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7, 8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain. Vitamin B6 is an essential micronutrient that plays an important role in the nervous system , with the vitamin B6 status affecting cognitive function at any age . Population studies indicate that low vitamin B6 levels are common among older people , and suggest that vitamin B6 deficiency may influence memory performance and may contribute to age-related cognitive decline . Vitamin B6 deficiency is also associated with other conditions characterized by impaired learning and memory, including neuropsychiatric disorders , Alzheimer’s disease , and inflammation . Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies are often insufficiently understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear . The term vitamin B6 encompasses the enzymatically interconvertible compounds pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal ( collectively referred to as B6 vitamers ), and their phosphorylated forms. Among these, only pyridoxal 5′-phosphate ( PLP ) is co-enzymatically active. In humans, PLP is known to be required for 44 distinct biochemical reactions, including the biosynthesis and/or metabolism of neurotransmitters, amino acids, lipids, and glucose. In addition, B6 vitamers display antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions . Cellular PLP availability in the brain depends on numerous factors, including the intestinal absorption of B6 vitamers, extracellular phosphatases, inter-organ transport and intracellular enzymes, and carriers/scavengers involved in PLP formation and homeostasis . Specifically, intracellular PLP is formed by the pyridoxal kinase ( PDXK ) -catalyzed phosphorylation of pyridoxal, or the pyridox ( am ) ine-5’-phosphate oxidase ( PNPO ) -catalyzed oxidation of pyridox ( am ) ine 5’-phosphate to PLP. PLP is highly reactive and can undergo condensation reactions with, e. g., primary amino groups or thiol groups in proteins or amino acids. Although the mechanisms of PLP delivery within the cells are still largely unknown, it is clear that the intracellular availability of PLP for co-enzymatic functions depends on PLP carriers/scavengers and on the hydrolytic activity of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase ( PDXP ) . We have previously shown that the genetic knockout of PDXP ( PDXP-KO ) in mice increases brain PLP levels and improves spatial memory and learning, suggesting that elevated PLP levels can improve cognitive functions in this model .

[ABSTRACT] Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells ( DTCs ), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors ( SGPs; Z1 and Z4 ). We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins ( CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20 ) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 ( RNAi ) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ. Most animals belonging to Bilateria have a mirror-symmetric body plan along the left-right axis, except for most internal organs. In mirror-symmetric tissues, cells in equivalent positions should acquire the same cell fates. Additionally, they are likely to exhibit mirror-symmetric polarity orientation for mirror-symmetric morphogenesis. However, the process to produce mirror symmetric polarity has not even been postulated except for a few examples. At the midline of the neural rod in the developing zebrafish neural tube, the polarity regulator Pard3 is localized on the cleavage furrow of neural progenitors and inherited by the two daughter cells on either side of the midline . This results in a mirror-image apico-basal polarity of the daughter cells and the subsequent formation of the ventricle. In the dorsal and ventral sides of the compound eye of Drosophila, ommatidia have mirror-image chirality that is regulated by protocadherins Fat/Dachsous and PCP ( planar cell polarity ) signaling . During the development of C. elegans, most cells are polarized in the same anterior-posterior orientation and divide asymmetrically to produce distinct daughter cells . This polarity is regulated by the Wnt signaling pathway known as the Wnt/β-catenin asymmetry pathway . Nuclear localization of POP-1/TCF, for example, is higher in the anterior than the posterior daughter cells ( hereafter called HL polarity for high-low POP-1 concentration ). However, there are some exceptions to the rule that result in mirror-symmetric polarity. During the development of the vulva, one of the vulval precursor cells ( VPCs ) P7. p has reversed polarity with higher POP-1 in the posterior daughter ( LH polarity for low-high POP-1 concentration ) . The mirror symmetric polarity between P7. p and another VPC P5. p is essential for their mirror-symmetric lineages and the structure of the vulva. The LH polarity of P7. p is instructed by Wnt proteins secreted from the anchor cell located between P5. p and P7. p . In the gonad, at the L1 stage, somatic gonadal precursor ( SGP ) cells, Z1 and Z4 have LH and HL polarity, respectively, creating their mirror-symmetric lineages producing distal tip cells ( DTCs ) from the distal daughters ( Z1. a and Z4. p ) .

[ABSTRACT] There is growing interest in designing multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. Tradeoffs are common in evolution and occur when, for example, resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. Major questions remain about the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable, specifically, whether the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs. This question is difficult because the drug-resistant mutants observed in the clinic, and even those evolved in controlled laboratory settings, are often biased towards those that provide large fitness benefits. Thus, the mutations ( and mechanisms ) that provide drug resistance may be more diverse than current results show. Here, we perform evolution experiments utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness advantage in fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. We then quantify fitness tradeoffs for each of 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments, finding these mutants group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs. Their unique tradeoffs may imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms. Some of the groupings we find are surprising. For example, we find some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination, while others do. And some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others. These findings, on one hand, demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. On the other hand, by demonstrating that hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to a few groups with characteristic tradeoffs, our findings may yet empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. More generally speaking, by grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms, our work guides efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation. How many different molecular mechanisms can a microbe exploit to adapt to a challenging environment ? Answering this question is particularly urgent in the field of drug resistance because infectious populations are adapting to available drugs faster than new drugs are developed . Understanding the mechanistic basis of drug resistance can inform strategies for how to combine existing drugs in a way that prevents the evolution of resistance . For example, one strategy exposes an infectious population to one drug ( Drug A ) knowing that the process of resistance to Drug A makes cells susceptible to Drug B . Problematically, these multi-drug strategies perform best when all mutants that resist Drug A have the same tradeoff in Drug B ( Figure 1A ). If there are multiple different mechanisms to resist Drug A, some of which lack this tradeoff, treatment strategies could fail ( Figure 1B ), and they sometimes do . Laboratory experiments that have power to search for universal tradeoffs – where all the mutants that perform well in one environment perform poorly in another – often find there are mutants that violate trends or the absence of trends altogether . Another way to phrase this observation is to say that adaptive mutations often have collateral effects in environments other than the one in which they originally evolved . But these effects, referred to in some studies as pleiotropic effects, can be unpredictable and context dependent .

[ABSTRACT] The central tendency bias, or contraction bias, is a effect where the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased toward the average of past observations. It is assumed to be an optimal strategy by the brain and commonly thought of as an expression of the brain’s ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. On the other hand, recency biases such as serial dependence are also commonly observed and are thought to reflect the content of working memory. Recent results from an auditory delayed comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought: when the posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) was silenced, both short-term and contraction biases were reduced. By proposing a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating the behavior, we show that a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience – producing short-term sensory history biases – naturally leads to contraction bias. The errors, occurring at the level of individual trials, are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory toward the sensory distribution’s mean. Our results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. Finally, we validate our model by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task. A fundamental question in neuroscience relates to how brains efficiently process the statistical regularities of the environment to guide behavior. Exploiting such regularities may be of great value to survival in the natural environment, but may lead to biases in laboratory tasks. Repeatedly observed across species and sensory modalities is the central tendency ( ‘contraction’ ) bias, where performance in perceptual tasks seemingly reflects a shift of the working memory ( WM ) representation toward the mean of the sensory history . Equally common are sequential biases, either attractive or repulsive, toward the immediate sensory history . It is commonly thought that these biases occur due to disparate mechanisms – contraction bias is widely thought to be a result of learning the statistical structure of the environment, whereas serial biases are thought to reflect the contents of WM . Recent evidence, however, challenges this picture: our recent study of a parametric working memory ( PWM ) task discovered that the rat posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) plays a key role in modulating contraction bias . When the region is optogenetically inactivated, contraction bias is attenuated. Intriguingly, however, this is also accompanied by the suppression of bias effects induced by the recent history of the stimuli, suggesting that the two phenomena may be interrelated. Interestingly, other behavioral components, including WM of immediate sensory stimuli ( in the current trial ), remain intact. In another recent study with humans, a double dissociation was reported between three cohorts of subjects: subjects on the autistic spectrum ( ASD ) expressed reduced biases due to recent statistics, whereas dyslexic subjects ( DYS ) expressed reduced biases toward long-term statistics, relative to neurotypical subjects ( NT ) . Finally, further complicating the picture is the observation of not only attractive serial dependency, but also repulsive biases .

[ABSTRACT] Immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy, fail in most cancer patients. We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 ( PDLIM2 ) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance, suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement. In this study, human clinical samples and data were used to investigate PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy, action process, and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles ( nanoPDLIM2 ) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) including those unleashed by ICIs. These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women with a 5-year survival rate of only 22% . Although these outcomes may be improved by immune checkpoint blockade therapy involving the disruption of the binding of programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1, also known as CD279 ) on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) to programmed death receptor ligand 1 ( PD-L1, also known as B7-H1 or CD274 ) on tumor and tumor-associated cells, most lung cancer patients still fail the therapy, with a response rate of only about 20% . In general, this revolutionary immunotherapy works better against ‘hot’ tumors, which have abundant TILs, strong immunogenicity and sufficient PD-L1 expression. Unfortunately, most tumors are ‘cold’, with low T-cell infiltration, weak immunogenicity and minimal PD-L1 expression, and show weak response to immune checkpoint inhibitors . Cold lung tumors without targetable oncogenic drivers are treated with chemotherapy as the standard approach . However, the response rate to this conventional cancer therapy is also low and resistance often occurs after an initial response, with an overall survival ( OS ) of about 12–17 months. Given its roles in inducing TILs and immunogenicity, in particular PD-L1 expression, to turn cold tumors hot, chemotherapy can be an ideal candidate for combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to improve therapeutic efficacy . Indeed, combination treatment with ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs shows synergy and better efficacy in both preclinical animal models and clinical trials of lung cancer and other cancers . However, even with the combination of ICIs and chemotherapy, tumors in animals do not remit completely and the objective response rate ( ORR ) of lung cancer patients only reaches 33–49. 7%, with a median progression-free survival ( PFS ) of just 5. 1–9 months and a median OS of 13–22 months .

[ABSTRACT] To survive in challenging environments, animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. However, the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system, which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior, are still not fully understood. Here, we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E. coli ), a low-sugar food, triggers cellular UPRER and immune response. This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which then regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPRER -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments. Food is essential for the survival, growth, and fitness of all animals. To adapt to fluctuating environments with a wide range of food sources, animals have developed a food evaluation system. This system enables them to identify nutrient-rich food and avoids low-quality or toxic food, thereby maximizing their survival prospects . Various sensory neuron evaluation systems in animals has evolved to evaluate food quality through vision , olfactory and gustatory senses . Besides these sensory systems that helped quick feeding decisions, animals may also initiate cellular stress response programs to detect nutrition/toxin and trigger food response behaviors . This could be one of physiological food quality evaluation systems that monitor the nutritional status of consumed food. However, the signaling events in cellular stress responses involved in evaluating of specific nutrients and the mechanisms that connect these signaling activities to food behaviors are largely unexplored. More specifically, while cellular stress response through UPRER and PMK-1/p38 MAPK -dependent immunity in response to pathogens have been extensively studied, the functions of these cellular stress response in sensing and evaluating specific nutrients from food remain unclear. Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient that cannot be synthesized by humans due to the loss of a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway . Animals obtain vitamin C from their diet and possibly also from gut microbes . Vitamin C is an important physiological antioxidant and a cofactor for a family of biosynthetic and gene regulatory monooxygenase and dioxygenase enzymes. It is also required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters . Vitamin C has been associated with various human diseases including scurvy, immune defect and cardiovascular disease . Therefore, in animals, having strong food evaluation systems to detect vitamin C levels could significantly impact their survival in the wild. However, the potential involvement of the cellular stress response pathway in this food evaluation system for sensing and assessing vitamin C remains largely unexplored. In this study, using the low-quality food evaluation assay system we established , we explained the process by which the cellular stress response pathway operates as a physiological food evaluation system. This pathway assesses the deficiency of D-glucose in food and the subsequent vitamin C content in animals through the unfolded protein response ( UPRER ) - innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis. This process promotes animals to leave low-quality food and is critical for their survival in nature environments.

[ABSTRACT] As a major class of biomolecules, carbohydrates play indispensable roles in various biological processes. However, it remains largely unknown how carbohydrates directly modulate important drug targets, such as G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ). Here, we employed P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ), a drug target for inflammation and immune responses, to uncover the sugar nucleotide activation of GPCRs. Integrating molecular dynamics simulation with functional study, we identified the uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) -sugar-binding site on P2Y14, and revealed that a UDP-glucose might activate the receptor by bridging the transmembrane ( TM ) helices 2 and 7. Between TM2 and TM7 of P2Y14, a conserved salt bridging chain ( K2. 60-D2. 64-K7. 35-E7. 36 ) was identified to distinguish different UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. We identified the KDKE chain as a conserved functional motif of sugar binding for both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ), and then designed three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12. These results not only expand our understanding for activation of purinergic receptors but also provide insights for the carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs. As significant components of the organism, carbohydrates play indispensable roles in energy supply, cell signaling, and immune responses . Dysregulation of carbohydrates has been proved to be associated with the development of various diseases . However, it is still elusive how carbohydrates directly act on major therapeutic targets, including G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ) represents an outstanding model system for understanding carbohydrate modulation of GPCRs. It belongs to P2Y purinoceptor subfamily, consisting of receptors responding to nucleotides, including adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and UDP . Distinct from the other purinoceptors, P2Y14 is potently activated by UDP and a class of carbohydrates, that is, UDP-sugars . UDP-sugars activate P2Y14 with a relative potency order of UDP-glucose ( UDP-Glc ), UDP-galactose ( UDP-Gal ), UDP-glucuronic acid ( UDP-GlcA ), and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine ( UDP-GlcNAc ) . These sugar nucleotides act as important signaling molecules via P2Y14 to mediate many physiological processes . Particularly, UDP-Glc regulates immune responses and associate with asthma, kidney injury, and lung inflammation . As an isomer of UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal is present in various cell models, including physiologically relevant primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells . It remains unknown how these sugar nucleotides are recognized by P2Y14. As the closest homolog to P2Y14, P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ) has not been reported to be activated by any sugar nucleotide . P2Y12 is potently activated ADP. The reported agonist-bound structures of P2Y12 provide insights to understand the nucleotide activation of P2Y purinoceptors. The crystal structures of P2Y12 show that a full agonist 2-methylthio-adenosine-5’-diphosphate ( 2MeSADP, a close analogue of ADP ) binds to an extracellular pocket consisting of transmembrane ( TM ) helices and extracellular loops . Since P2Y12 is highly similar to P2Y14 with 45. 67% amino acid sequence identity, it would be interesting to investigate whether this receptor is also sensible to sugar nucleotides. Here, we combined molecular docking, molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations, and functional study to reveal the molecular process how P2Y14 is activated by a sugar nucleotide. The ligand-binding models of different UDP-sugars ( UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcA, and UDP-GlcNAc ) were quantitatively characterized to identify the sugar recognition site of P2Y14. Both P2Y14 and P2Y12 were employed to unveil a conserved sugar-binding motif.

[ABSTRACT] Stem cell niche is critical for regulating the behavior of stem cells. Drosophila neural stem cells ( Neuroblasts, NBs ) are encased by glial niche cells closely, but it still remains unclear whether glial niche cells can regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs. Here, we show that ferritin produced by glia, cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for the energy production, which is essential to the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. The knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD+ level, which leads to the low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. More importantly, ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. In addition, the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable to maintain the self-renewal of NBs, unveiling a new role of the NB glial niche during brain development. Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) possess the remarkable ability to self-renew for maintaining their identity and differentiate into diverse neural cell types required for neurogenesis during brain development. The self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation of NSCs are regulated by both intrinsic programs inside stem cells and extrinsic cues from the surrounding niches. The mammalian NSC niche found in the neurogenic regions is composed of diverse cell types including choroid plexus, vascular endothelia cells, pericytes, microglia, and meninges, which regulate NSC behaviors such as proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation . The diversity and complexity of these cell populations confer niche the ability to integrate local and systemic signals, but make it complicated to study the interaction between niches and NSCs in mammals, which is a critical issue in understanding neurogenesis and improving clinical applications of NSCs. Drosophila larval central nervous system ( CNS ), composed of the central brain ( CB ), optic lobe ( OL ), and ventral nerve cord ( VNC ), is a simple but sophisticated model to decipher the regulatory mechanisms underlying NSC behaviors mediated by niche signals. In this system, Drosophila NSCs, called NBs, and their progenies are encased by a variety of glial cells including perineurial glia, subperineurial glia, cortex glia, astrocyte-like glia and ensheathing glia . These glial cells not only form the physical support structure for NBs, but also provide extrinsic cues that regulate NB reactivation, survival, and proliferation . However, it remains elusive whether the glial-cell-forming niche is involved in the regulation of the prominent characteristics of NBs, self-renewal, and differentiation. Iron is a vital micronutrient for almost all living organisms since it participates in many crucial biological processes, including mitochondrial electron transport and cellular respiration that both support ATP production used for most cellular activities. High levels of iron are found in many organs including the brain, where iron is required for myelination and formation of neuronal dendritic trees . Iron deficiency in infants and early childhood has been well-documented to be associated with long-term cognitive, social, and emotional problems . Thus, it is intriguing to investigate whether iron is also required in NSCs during neurogenesis. Ferritin, a ubiquitous protein present in most organisms, is composed of 24 subunits that assemble into a hollow-sphere complex capable of storing up to 4500 iron atoms in a bioavailable form . Ferritin in both mammals and insects is a heteropolymer, consisting of heavy and light chain homolog subunits.

[ABSTRACT] Cancer is considered a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, yet several countries have reported that deaths with a primary code of cancer remained within historic levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we further explained the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US. We compared pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause ( MC ) death data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s. Any pandemic-related changes in coding practices should be eliminated by study of MC data. Nationally in 2020, MC cancer mortality rose by only 3% over a pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to ~13, 600 excess deaths. Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers ( breast, colorectal, and hematological, 2–7% ) than cancers with a poor survival rate ( lung and pancreatic, 0–1% ). In comparison, there was substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes ( 37% ) and Alzheimer’s ( 19% ). To understand these differences, we simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates, life expectancy, population size, and mean age of individuals living with each condition. We find that the observed mortality differences are primarily explained by differences in life expectancy, with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19. The dominant risk factors for COVID-19 mortality have consistently been shown to be advanced age, male gender, and certain chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease . Cancer has also been identified as a high-risk condition based on case-control and cohort studies, although these studies have provided conflicting results. In a large cohort study of ~500, 000 COVID-19 inpatients, only cancer patients under recent treatment were at increased risk of COVID-19-related deaths ( OR = 1. 7 ) relative to non-cancer patients . Conversely, a smaller European study of 3000 COVID-19 inpatients found that cancer was not a risk factor , as did an international, multicenter study of 4000 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients . More recently a meta-analysis of 35 studies from Europe, North America, and Asia found a twofold increased risk of COVID-19 mortality among cancer patients . Similarly, a large analysis from the UK found that the risk of COVID-19 mortality for cancer patients had declined over the course of the pandemic but remained 2. 5 times higher than for non-cancer patients into 2022 . Taken together, such observational studies provide a mixed picture of cancer as a COVID-19 mortality risk factor, with several studies reporting that controlling for important factors such as age is a challenge. Furthermore, cancer is often considered as a single disease category despite the diversity of conditions and patients represented. Further evidence for the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 comes from population-level analysis of vital statistics. A recent US study showed no elevation in underlying cancer deaths concomitant with COVID-19 waves, in stark contrast to the sharp rise in mortality from other chronic diseases . In several other countries, including Sweden, Italy, Latvia, Brazil, England, and Wales, underlying cancer mortality was found to be stable or decreasing during the first year of the pandemic . Further, an excess mortality study of 240, 000 cancer patients in Belgium found a 33% rise in mortality in April 2020, but concluded that this was no different from the rise observed in the general population .

[ABSTRACT] The R-loop is a common transcriptional by-product that consists of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA. While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established, there is still an incomplete understanding of the cellular processes responsible for their removal from eukaryotic genomes. Here, we show that a core regulator of chromosome architecture —the Smc5/6 complex— plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription. Consistent with this, budding yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong synthetic interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in their chromosomes. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme in vitro. Collectively, our results reveal a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. The maintenance of genome stability is a primordial function that ensures the proper development and homeostasis of all living organisms . Successful maintenance of genomic integrity requires constant monitoring and repair of DNA lesions because genomes are under constant attack from endogenous sources of DNA damage . One of the most common sources of endogenous DNA damage is the formation of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in chromosomes. During transcription, nascent RNA transcripts can re-anneal to complementary DNA strands producing an RNA-DNA hybrid and displace the template strand, creating an obstacle to the progression of the DNA replication machinery. The resulting RNA-DNA hybrid and displaced ssDNA segment —together termed the R-loop— are highly deleterious for genome integrity . RNA-DNA hybrid structures can also be formed under a variety of physiological conditions in eukaryotic genomes and play important roles in cell physiology and regulate genome dynamics. Common physiological roles of RNA-DNA hybrids include immunoglobulin class switching recombination of B cells in vertebrates , mitochondrial DNA replication , bacterial plasmid replication , and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing . Moreover, RNA-DNA hybrids co-ordinate specific regulatory steps in transcription initiation and termination , telomere homeostasis , and gene expression . However, the formation of unprogrammed or non-physiological RNA-DNA hybrid structures can interfere with DNA replication-related processes, resulting in replicative stress and the formation of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . Importantly, exposed ssDNA in the R-loop can be cleaved by different endonucleases leading to DNA breaks and/or mutagenic events, and can also adopt harmful secondary structures . R-loop-induced DNA damage and genomic rearrangements have been linked to various disease states in humans. Examples include trinucleotide repeat-associated diseases, auto-immune disorders, neurological disorders, and cancer, although it is not currently known whether R-loops play a causative or consequential role in such diseases . To mitigate the toxic consequences associated with the presence of unprogrammed RNA-DNA hybrids in chromosomes, several cellular mechanisms work in concert to prevent their formation, and when they do accumulate, remove them from eukaryotic genomes. For instance, the Ribonuclease H ( RNase H ) family of enzymes plays a central role in degrading the RNA moiety of R-loops created under a variety of genomic conditions . Recently, it was shown that the RNase DICER can also cleave the RNA moiety of the R-loops in higher eukaryotes .

[ABSTRACT] Preserved communication abilities promote healthy ageing. To this end, the age-typical loss of sensory acuity might in part be compensated for by an individual’s preserved attentional neural filtering. Is such a compensatory brain–behaviour link longitudinally stable ? Can it predict individual change in listening behaviour ? We here show that individual listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories modelling electroencephalographic and behavioural data of N = 105 ageing individuals ( 39–82 y ). First, despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity, listening-task performance proved stable over 2 y. Second, neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint ( T1, T2 ). Longitudinally, however, our results raise caution on attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour: neither neural filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change could predict individual 2-year behavioural change, under a combination of modelling strategies. Speech comprehension is an essential aspect of human communication, enabling us to understand and interact with others effectively. Preserved communication is therefore critical to social well-being and healthy ageing . Any translational advance aimed at maintaining and restoring successful cognitive ageing crucially relies on understanding the factors that explain and predict individual trajectories of listening performance. However, the evidence on these potential factors is astonishingly limited. As we age, our ability to comprehend speech can decline due to age-related changes in the auditory system ( i. e. sensory acuity ) and in cognitive resources. Age-related hearing loss reduces the ability to detect and discriminate speech sounds, especially in noisy environments. However, it has long been recognised that increasing age and hearing loss cannot fully account for the considerable degree of inter-individual differences observed in listening behaviour and its lifespan change . Recent research has focused on the neurobiological mechanisms that promote successful speech comprehension by implementing ‘neural filters’ that segregate behaviourally relevant from irrelevant sounds. Such neural filter mechanisms act by selectively increasing the sensory gain for behaviourally relevant inputs or by inhibiting the processing of irrelevant inputs . A growing body of evidence suggests that speech comprehension is neurally supported by an attention-guided filter process that modulates sensory gain and arises from primary auditory and perisylvian brain regions: by synchronising its neural activity with the temporal structure of the speech signal of interest, the brain ‘tracks’ and thereby better encodes behaviourally relevant auditory inputs to enable attentive listening . In a large age-varying cohort ( N = 155; 39–80 y ), we have previously shown how the fidelity of this neural filtering strategy can help explain differences in listening behaviour ( i ) from individual to individual and ( ii ) within individuals from sentence to sentence . As participants performed a challenging dual-talker listening task, we recorded their electroencephalogram ( EEG ). We observed that enhanced neural filtering—defined as stronger neural tracking of attended vs. ignored speech—led to more accurate and overall faster responses. Notably, we observed both neural filtering as well as its link to behaviour to be independent of chronological age and severity of hearing loss . The observation of such brain–behaviour relationships critically advances our understanding of the neurobiological foundation of cognitive functioning by showing, for example, how neural implementations of auditory selective attention support attentive listening. They also provide fruitful ground for scientific inquiries into the translational potential of neural markers.

[ABSTRACT] The perception of taste and flavour ( a combination of taste, smell, and chemesthesis ), here also referred to as chemosensation, enables animals to find high-value foods and avoid toxins. Humans have learned to use unpalatable and toxic substances as medicines, yet the importance of chemosensation in this process is poorly understood. Here, we generate tasting-panel data for botanical drugs and apply phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models to test whether intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities as well as particular tastes and flavours can predict ancient Graeco-Roman drug use. We found chemosensation to be strongly predictive of therapeutic use: botanical drugs with high therapeutic versatility have simple yet intense tastes and flavours, and 21 of 22 chemosensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use. In addition to the common notion of bitter tasting medicines, we also found starchy, musky, sweet, and soapy drugs associated with versatility. In ancient Greece and Rome, illness was thought to arise from imbalance in bodily fluids or humours, yet our study suggests that uses of drugs were based on observed physiological effects that are often consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology. ‘A bitter pill to swallow’ is just one of many common idioms referring to the taste of medicine, which from ancient to early modern times has relied mostly on botanical drugs . In ancient Greece and Rome, the expected effects of botanical drugs were explained by their taste and according to the prevailing medical theory, disease resulted from a disequilibrium between bodily fluids or humours including phlegm, blood, yellow bile, and black bile; drugs affected the flow and balance of these humours . Theophrastus ( 300 BCE ) attributed sweet the capacity to smoothen, astringent with the power to desiccate and solidify, pungent with the capacity to cut or to separate out the heat, salty with desiccating and irritating properties, and bitter with the capacity to melt and irritate . Other systems of medicine, such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, continue to classify materia medica according to tastes and flavours , and indigenous societies use chemosensory qualities to select botanical drugs . The perception of taste and flavour ( a combination of taste, smell, and chemesthesis ), here also referred to as chemosensation, has evolved to meet nutritional requirements and is particularly important in omnivores for seeking out nutrients and avoiding toxins . The rejection of bitter stimuli has generally been associated with the avoidance of toxins but to date no clear relationship between bitter compounds and toxicity at a nutritionally relevant dose could be established . While bitter tasting metabolites occurring in fruits and vegetables have been linked with a lower risk for contracting cancer and cardiovascular diseases , the avoidance of pharmacologically active compounds is probably the reason why many medicines, including botanical drugs, taste bitter . Botanical drugs are chemically complex and often used for a range of different health problems . Chemical complexity determines pharmacological complexity, since different chemicals interact with different targets , and influence taste complexity and intensity . Today, some associations between chemosensory qualities and therapeutic uses, such as bitter-tasting botanical drugs for stomach problems or astringent ones for diarrhoea, are still recognised in Western herbal medicine . These observations establish a role for chemosensory qualities in medicine. Yet, taste and flavour are largely irrelevant to modern medicine, aside from the pharmaceutical industry looking for ways to mask bad tastes .

[ABSTRACT] Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae are associated with gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death, from sepsis, for individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. The bacterial behaviors and mechanisms underlying why these bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry remain poorly understood. Herein, we report that clinical isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter koseri are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum. To simulate GI bleeding, we utilized an injection-based microfluidics device and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source. This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr. We report the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues. We find Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Lastly, we find that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. We define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and the consumption of serum nutrients as ‘bacterial vampirism’, which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections. Bacteria use chemosensory systems to survey and navigate their environments . In the exceptionally dynamic environment of the host gut, peristalsis and flow constantly perturb the microscopic physicochemical landscape. Responding to such transient and shifting stimuli is enabled by chemosensing that allows bacteria to rapidly restructure their populations, within seconds, through taxis toward or away from effector sources . Many enteric pathogens and pathobionts use a form of chemosensing known as chemotaxis to colonize specific tissues, whereby bacteria swim toward or away from sources of exogenous nutrients, toxins, and host-emitted cues . Previously, we determined that most bacterial genera classified by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as ‘priority pathogens’ employ chemotaxis systems for efficient infection and exert precise control over their colonization topography . These include multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae pathogens of the gut such as Salmonella enterica, Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EHEC ), Citrobacter koseri, and Enterobacter cloacae, which present major challenges for nosocomial infections and global health . Mapping the chemosensing signals enteric bacteria perceive within the host can provide insight into pathogenesis and perhaps be a source of drug targets for inhibiting pathogen navigation and colonization . Gut dysbiosis—a diseased host state induced by pathologies, inflammation, and infections—exposes enteric bacteria to chemical stimuli distinct from that of a healthy gut that could encourage opportunistic pathogenesis . Yet, the stimuli sensed by bacterial pathogens and pathobionts within the dysbiotic gut environment remain poorly understood. Investigating how chemosensing controls the responses of pathogen populations to chemical features associated with dysbiosis presents an opportunity to gain deeper insights into the critical juncture between infection resolution and exacerbation . In a diseased gut, enteric bacteria may encounter a distinctive host-derived chemical feature not found in a healthy gut: GI bleeding. The microenvironment of an enteric hemorrhagic lesion involves a source of serum, the liquid component of blood, emanating from the host tissue and diffusing into the intestinal lumen ( Figure 1 ).

[ABSTRACT] Male germ cells share a common origin across animal species, therefore they likely retain a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity. However, the unique evolutionary dynamics of male germ cells coupled with their widespread leaky transcription pose significant obstacles to the identification of the core spermatogenic program. Through network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species, we describe the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level. We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10, 000 protein-coding genes, a third of which defines a genetic scaffold of deeply conserved genes that has been retained throughout evolution. Such scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis. By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies. Understanding what defines the uniqueness of a given cell type out of the 843 predicted cellular fates in the human body is a complex and fascinating problem . Through Conrad Waddington’s foundational work, we have come to appreciate that developmental trajectories ultimately dictate cell type identity via the establishment of specific transcriptional programs . The fact that transcriptomes tend to cluster by tissue type rather than by species clearly indicates that gene expression identity can be maintained across many million years of evolutionary divergence. This echoes the modular nature of eukaryotic biological processes, whose intervening macromolecular complexes are typically built by the addition of younger components to a core block of ancient subunits . The emergence of germ cells is considered one of the first cell type specializations in metazoan history . Since the capability to undergo both sexual reproduction and gametogenesis were already present in the unicellular ancestor of all Metazoa , the split between germ line and soma presumably provided early multicellular organisms increased robustness against mutations while minimizing genetic conflict between different cell lineages . Yet, reproductive protein genes are some of the most rapidly evolving across the tree of life , leading to substantial variation in male reproductive tissues even between closely related species . At the molecular level, this variation can be mainly traced back to rapid evolutionary changes in gene expression in the testis – likely helped by widespread transcriptional leakage in male germ cells – and to the preferential emergence of new genes in this organ , where they often acquire functions in spermatogenesis . Although the rapid divergence of genes directly involved in reproduction has traditionally been interpreted from an adaptationist stance, relaxed selection and drift have been recently proposed to account for this pattern . Central to this debate is the often-overlooked contribution of old genes for germ cell development and function. We have recently observed, in a wide range of plant species, a substantial contribution of old genes to the pollen transcriptome, suggestive of an ancient transcriptional program common to plant male gametes .

[ABSTRACT] Eukaryotes swim with coordinated flagellar ( ciliary ) beating and steer by fine-tuning the coordination. The model organism for studying flagellate motility, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, employs synchronous, breaststroke-like flagellar beating to swim, and it modulates the beating amplitudes differentially to steer. This strategy hinges on both inherent flagellar asymmetries ( e. g. different response to chemical messengers ) and such asymmetries being effectively coordinated in the synchronous beating. In C. reinhardtii, the synchrony of beating is known to be supported by a mechanical connection between flagella; however, how flagellar asymmetries persist in the synchrony remains elusive. For example, it has been speculated for decades that one flagellum leads the beating, as its dynamic properties ( i. e. frequency, waveform, etc. ) appear to be copied by the other one. In this study, we combine experiments, computations, and modeling efforts to explained the roles played by each flagellum in synchronous beating. With a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum, we show that the coordinated beating essentially only responds to load exerted on the cis flagellum; and that such asymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two flagella. Our results highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in coordination and have implication for biflagellates’ tactic behaviors. We set out to establish a non-invasive experimental technique that exerts differential loads on the flagella of C. reinhardtii. Following Quaranta et al., 2015, we use external background flows to exert hydrodynamic forcing on captured cells. Hydrodynamic forces are generated by a relative motion between the captured cell and its surrounding fluid. While the cell is captured by a glass pipette fixed in the laboratory frame, the fluid moves with the flow chamber - which is fixed on an oscillating piezoelectric stage. By programming the sinusoidal oscillations of the stage, we generate flows of desired amplitude U0 and frequency f0 and impose these flows along different directions θ to differentially load the two flagella, see Figure 1A. For each recording, we extract the phase dynamics of flagellar beating from videography , Figure 1B. First, recordings are masked and thresholded to highlight the flagella. Then, we extract the mean pixel values over time within two sampling windows ( Figure 1C ), and convert the two signals into observable-invariant flagellar phases ϕc, t , see Figure 1D. In all our experimental recordings, the cis and the trans flagella beat synchronously. Typical phase locking between them is represented in Figure 1D inset, where the phase difference Δ=ϕc−ϕt fluctuates around 0. Therefore, ϕc and ϕt are equal and denoted as ϕ. The response of the flagella to the external hydrodynamic loads is therefore characterized by the difference between the flagellar phase ϕ ( t ) and the phase of the oscillating flow ϕ0=2πf0t. Hereafter, we refer to the synchronization of the flagellar beating with the imposed external flow as ‘flow entrainment’, to avoid confusion with the ‘synchronization’ between the cis and the trans flagella. In our experiments, the cis and trans flagella always beat synchronously, therefore flow entrainment always takes place for both flagella simultaneously, regardless of the flow’s direction. Differential external loads are selectively exerted on the cis- and the trans-flagellum by imposing oscillatory background flows at an angle with respect to the cell’s symmetry axis. We use numerical simulations to quantify the differential loads exerted by flows along different angles θ = 45°, 90°, and 135°, on the cis- and the trans flagellum, see Figure 1A.

[ABSTRACT] process underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) production by type 3 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC3s ) and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor ( IL-22R ) attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting. Obesity is defined as an epidemic metabolic disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation as the consequence of long-term energy surplus. Thus, therapeutic management of obesity has been focused on the restoration of energy balance, either by decreasing energy intake or by increasing energy expenditure . Among these strategies, intermittent fasting is becoming a popular dietary approach. All intermittent fasting schemes including alternate day fasting, 5:2 intermittent fasting, and daily time-restricted feeding have shown the health benefits such as delaying aging , improving metabolism , and enhancing cognition . The process underlying metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Its metabolic benefit was initially attributed to limitation of energy intake. Recent studies have indicated an alternative process involving beigeing of white adipose tissue, which accounts for the major plasticity of energy expenditure. Studies by Kim et al., 2017, have shown that intermittent fasting induces white adipose beigeing via stimulation of angiogenesis and macrophage M2 polarization. On the other hand, studies by Li et al., 2017, have indicated that alternate day fasting induces white adipose tissue beigeing by shaping the gut microbiota and elevating the fermentation products acetate and lactate. Although gut microbiota is closely related to immune response, it remains unclear whether intestinal immune cells contribute to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting. Innate lymphoid cells ( ILCs ) are a group of natural immune cells lacking antigen-specific receptors expressed on T cells and B cells . Based on developmental trajectories, ILCs are divided into five groups: natural killer cells, type 1 ILCs, type 2 ILCs, type 3 ILCs ( ILC3s ), and lymphoid tissue-inducing cells . Adipose-resident type 1 ILCs can promote adipose tissue fibrosis and obesity-associated insulin resistance while type 2 ILCs promote beiging of white adipose tissue and limit obesity . However, the contribution of ILC3s on adipocytes and obesity are less clear. ILC3s can produce interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) and interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) in response to extracellular bacteria and fungi . ILC3s-derived IL-22 can enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier function, reduce endotoxemia and inflammation, ameliorate insulin sensitivity , and improve the metabolic disorder of polycystic ovary syndrome . However, ILC3s are also reported to be involved in the induction of obesity , contributing to the metabolic disease . Therefore, the role of ILC3s in metabolic disease seems complex and the role of ILC3s in intermittent fasting and beigeing of adipose tissue is not known. Here, we showed that alternate day fasting promoted the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s. Further, adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased thermogenesis in diet-induced obesity ( DIO ) mice.

[ABSTRACT] Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms focus only on freezing behavior, obscuring the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses. To thoroughly investigate defensive ethograms, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice to a Pavlovian conditioning model that paired footshock with a serial compound stimulus ( SCS ) consisting of distinct tone and white noise ( WN ) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared this paired SCS-footshock group with four control groups that were conditioned with either pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock, shock only, or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order, with paired or unpaired presentations. On day 2 of conditioning, the paired group exhibited strong freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period. Comparatively, the unpaired and both reverse SCS groups expressed less tone-induced freezing and rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following the second day of conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS, with minimal freezing and jumping. Interestingly, the paired reverse group did not jump to WN, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for strong cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression. Defensive responses have evolved to maximize survival , and animals rapidly switch behaviors depending on threat imminence, the context of exposure, and previous experience with stimuli . Understanding the mechanisms underlying adaptive defensive behavior may grant insight into the pathophysiology of post-traumatic stress and panic disorders, wherein heightened responses to external stimuli are observed, yet neuroscientists need more tractable methods with which to investigate how the nervous system controls complex experience-dependent behavior. Pavlovian fear conditioning has been widely used as a model system to understand the neural mechanisms underlying fear-related learning and memory . In standard Pavlovian conditioning paradigms, freezing is the dominant defensive behavior evoked by contexts and learned cues that are paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus ( US ), like footshock . Other defensive responses like escape jumping and darting are measured less often within conditioning, limiting insight into defensive response dynamics. To address this critical need, we developed a modified Pavlovian conditioning model that elicits both freezing and flight behaviors in response to conditioned stimuli , findings that have been replicated by others in both mice and rats . In this model, mice are conditioned with a SCS consisting of a pure tone followed by WN, which terminates with a strong electrical footshock. After conditioning, mice exhibit contextual freezing which significantly increases in response to tone, and mice switch to strong flight responses upon WN presentation. These findings demonstrate that the magnitude and mode of defensive behavior change with the psychological distance of threat, consistent with the predatory imminence continuum theory . However, the influence of non-associative elements on this ethological profile has recently been discussed .

[ABSTRACT] To navigate their environment, insects need to keep track of their orientation. Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage. To address this question, we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits, all with different activity patterns. Among these activity patterns, we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons. We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly, finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development. Finally, we illustrate that in our theory, the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles. Insects exhibit an impressive ability to navigate the world, travelling long distances to migrate, find food or reach places of interest before returning to their nests , a feat that requires them to keep track of their orientation across long journeys . This orientation tracking is achieved by the use of visual cues as well as integrating angular velocity signals over time to maintain a heading estimate relative to a starting angle , known as heading integration. Electrophysiological and calcium imaging studies have shown that the neural population encoding the head direction in insects has a sinusoid-shaped activation pattern . Furthermore, downstream neural populations also encode velocity signals as sinusoidal activations . Theoretical work has speculated that this recurring motif of sinusoidal activity patterns might be so prevalent because it enables easy elementwise vector addition, where vectors encoded as sinusoidal activity waveforms can be added together to give a sinusoidal waveform encoding the sum of the vectors . This allows the encoded heading to be easily used by downstream circuitry to track the insect’s position . Further studies have shown that models closely aligned with biological data can indeed implement heading integration using sinusoidal activity patterns , and that such circuits can be learned . Here, we show that enabling easy vector addition cannot be the unique driving factor for the presence of sinusoidal heading encodings, as many other circuits with different activity patterns can perform vector addition in the same way. This finding led us to question whether the sinusoidal activation patterns seen in insect navigation circuits are a coincidence, or if they might offer a particular functional advantage that was selected for during evolution. To address this question, we consider the basic principles necessary for a circuit encoding direction. Of all the circuits fulfilling these requirements, the sinusoidal activity pattern offers the best resilience to noise for the encoded information. However, obtaining this activity requires a circuit with a specific connectivity pattern between neurons. Thus, our theory predicts that the heading integration circuit will have a sinusoidal connectivity pattern.

[ABSTRACT] Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. In this conformation CISD1 cannot coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpressing Cisd, the Drosophila ortholog of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies. Complete loss of Cisd, in contrast, rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Our results suggest that Cisd, probably iron-depleted Cisd, operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target. Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is the fastest growing neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by rigor, tremor, and bradykinesia. These motor symptoms stem from the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain’s substantia nigra pars compacta . While most cases are sporadic, familial forms of PD are linked to mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in mitochondrial quality control like PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and Parkin ( PRKN ), providing valuable insights into the pathophysiology of PD . In healthy cells, PINK1 is continuously imported into mitochondria, where it is rapidly degraded . However, in unfit mitochondria with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential ( Δψm ), PINK1 import stalls. When PINK1 accumulates on damaged mitochondria, it phosphorylates various proteins, including the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRKN. This phosphorylation activates PRKN, enabling it to attach ubiquitin to mitochondrial proteins. This ubiquitination acts as a signal for damaged mitochondria to be identified and engulfed by autophagosomes, initiating their degradation through mitophagy. This selective elimination of compromised mitochondria safeguards overall mitochondrial health and function . Much of this mechanistic understanding has been explained in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster where Pink1 and Prkn loss of function results in profound changes of the mitochondrial ultrastructure causing mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired flight and climbing ability, and a shortened lifespan . In addition to disturbances in mitochondrial quality control, disruptions in iron metabolism contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of PD . PD patients exhibit elevated iron levels within the substantia nigra pars compacta, and this iron accumulation correlates with the severity of the disease . Notably, this iron dysregulation is apparent even in asymptomatic carriers of PRKN mutations , suggesting that it is an early event and correlates with mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, human dopaminergic neurons lacking PINK1 display inhibition of the iron-dependent mitochondrial aconitase, leading to accumulation of NAD+ and depletion of essential metabolites . In flies, Pink1 deficiency similarly results in inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase by impairing its labile iron-sulfur cluster, leading to oxidative distress and mitochondrial swelling . These findings highlight the relevance of iron dysregulation in the PD development and progression. An important target protein of PINK1/PRKN crucial for iron homeostasis and redox homeostasis is CISD1, also known as mitoNEET .

[ABSTRACT] Obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to helped transmission to new hosts. The molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes - where genetic information of one organism is manifested as traits in another - remain largely unclear. This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants. However, we previously demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves and the leaf-like flowers were not required. Here, we made the surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, this phytoplasma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males. Critically, the host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase ( SVP ) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed svp null mutant plants over those not exposed to males. Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. Importantly, we clarify how SAP54, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males, thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects. SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’, helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes, but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions. Parasites often excel in altering the development and behavior of their hosts, a trait essential for their survival and propagation. The trait is particularly pronounced in obligate parasites, which have substantial control over their hosts, earning them the nickname 'puppet masters'. The effect exemplifies the concept of extended phenotypes , where the impact of an organism’s genes extends beyond its own physical form and affects other organisms. This concept is especially evident in obligate parasites that depend on alternate hosts for transmission, as they often do not only alter the conditions of their immediate hosts but also have far-reaching effects on other organisms in the ecosystem. For instance, the protozoan parasite Taxoplasma gondii changes the behavior of their intermediate rodent hosts by reducing their innate fear for cats, which are the definite hosts where the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction to produce oocysts . Similarly, the rust fungus Puccinia monoica induces its host plant, Boechera stricta, to produce 'pseudoflowers'. These structures mimic real flowers and attract pollinators with their scent and sugary rewards, an essential strategy for the fungus to spread its spores between plants . Although advancements have been made in identifying parasite virulence factors, our understanding of the specific host processes that are commandeered to produce these extended phenotypes is still developing. Parallel to these discoveries are the studies on the extended phenotypes of phytoplasmas, which have revealed that their manipulative abilities stem from particular genes within these pathogens . Phytoplasmas cause disease in crops, ornamentals and native plants worldwide and are often dependent on sap-feeding insects, including leafhoppers, plant hoppers and psyllids, for transmission .

[ABSTRACT] Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with significant socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, at least in part, because C. albicans can initiate a strong drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration. To better characterize this cytoprotective tolerance program at the molecular single-cell level, we used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish their subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage with distinct metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure ( a time when tolerance is measurable ), surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing machinery, and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity, termed the Ribo-dominant ( Rd ) state; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes, termed the Stress-dominant ( Sd ) state. This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment. We provide evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response ( RASTR ) is activated in these subpopulations and may helped cell survival. Candida albicans is one of the most prevalent human fungal pathogens . Systemic C. albicans infections are the second most common cause of mortality from infectious diseases in extremely premature infants ( 15–20% mortality ), and the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections ( 30–50% mortality ) . The frequency of drug resistance is far lower than the frequency of treatment failures, such that most infections that fail to respond to antifungal drug treatments are susceptible to the drug. This clinical persistence can result from heterogeneity in antifungal drug responses, variations in host immune status, and the inability of drugs to reach their fungal target sites . A resistant fungal isolate can thrive in the presence of an antifungal drug at concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of that species, with detectable growth within 24 hr of drug exposure. For a tolerant fungal isolate, a proportion of cells ( typically 5–95% of the population ) can grow, albeit slowly, at concentrations surpassing the population average MIC ; tolerance is detectable only 48 hr after drug exposure, which is longer than most clinical assays are performed . Approaches for predicting patient response to an infection, based solely on the average response of cells to a drug challenge across a population after 24 hr, can overlook such subpopulations with behaviors that have the potential to significantly impact the evolution of drug resistance . Resistance usually results from mutations that directly influence interaction of the drug with its target , while tolerance is thought to stem from phenotypic heterogeneity or cell-to-cell variations in phenotypic responses within an isogenic cell population. Microbial phenotypic heterogeneity can arise from mechanisms including stochastic or periodic gene expression, protein stability, cell age, cell-cell interactions, chromatin modifications, and genomic neoplasticity . Heterogeneity in microbial populations can confer benefits like bet-hedging, rapid metabolic shifts, division of labor, and resource sharing . It is important to note the distinction between antibacterial and antifungal drug tolerance. For bacteria, tolerance is defined by the duration of cell survival following periodic exposure to a bactericidal drug .

[ABSTRACT] The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits variation among species in the effectiveness of selection. In an idealized model, the census population size determines both this minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged, and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirically, an ‘effective population size’ is often estimated from the amount of putatively neutral genetic diversity and is assumed to also capture a species’ effectiveness of selection. A potentially more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons. However, past metrics that compare codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in %GC content and/or amino acid composition. Here, we propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ), based on Kullback–Leibler divergence, that corrects for both confounders. We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations, as well as the Effective Number of Codons, to show that the protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder. Species differ from each other in many ways, including mating system, ploidy, spatial distribution, life history, size, lifespan, genome size, mutation rate, selective pressure, and population size. These differences make the process of purifying selection more efficient in some species than others. Our understanding of both the causes and consequences of these differences is limited in part by a reliable metric with which to measure them. In the long term, the probability that a gene is fixed for one allele rather than another allele is given by the ratio of fixation and counter-fixation probabilities . In an idealized population of constant population size and no selection at linked sites, a mutation–selection–drift model describes how this ratio of fixation probabilities depends on the census population size N , and hence gives the fraction of sites expected to be found in preferred vs. non-preferred states ( Figure 1 ). This reasoning has been extended to real populations by positing that species have an ‘effective’ population size, Ne . Ne is the census population size of an idealized population that reproduces a property of interest in the focal population. Ne is therefore not a single quantity per population, but instead depends on which property is of interest. The amount of neutral polymorphism is the usual property used to empirically estimate Ne . However, the property of most relevance to nearly neutral theory is instead the inflection point s at which non-preferred alleles become common enough to matter ( Figure 1 ), and hence the degree to which highly exquisite adaptation can be maintained in the face of ongoing mutation and genetic drift . While genetic diversity has been found to reflect some aspects of life history strategy , there remain concerns about whether neutral genetic diversity and the limits to weak selection always remain closely coupled in non-equilibrium settings. As a practical matter, Ne is usually calculated by dividing some measure of the amount of putatively neutral ( often synonymous ) polymorphism segregating in a population by that species’ mutation rate . As a result, Ne values are only available for species that have both polymorphism data and accurate mutation rate estimates, limiting their use. Worse, Ne is not a strong statistic. In the absence of a clear species definition, polymorphism is sometimes calculated across too broad a range of genomes, substantially inflating Ne ; a poor sampling scheme can have the converse effect of deflating genetic diversity.

[ABSTRACT] Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO. Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation. An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) that is released by inflamed host cells and tissues, and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP. Using genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. In addition, impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane notably contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed E. coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. In addition, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis. Worldwide, 11 million sepsis-related deaths were reported in 2017, which accounted for an estimated 19. 7% of all global deaths . Given its high incidence and immense socio-economic burden, the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has declared sepsis as a global health priority . Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an imbalanced host immune response to infection. Antibiotic treatment remains the main approach to treat sepsis; however, despite the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, lethality remains high. Immune-modulating strategies are an additional approach to antibiotics to curb excessive inflammation and to support an effective defense against the infectious agents. Until recently however, most trials inhibiting cytokine responses or Toll-like receptors failed, indicating that alternative approaches for immunomodulation are required . It has been shown that adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), as soon as it is released into the extracellular space, critically modulates inflammatory and immune responses by activating ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y receptors . Also, such purinergic signaling critically alters immune responses during sepsis . In particular, we have described that the connexin-dependent release of ATP by macrophages initiates an autocrine loop of over-activation, resulting in altered local and systemic cytokine secretion, which exacerbates abdominal sepsis . Such sepsis-promoting effects of host-derived extracellular ATP are secondary to inflammation initiated by bacterial pathogens. Recently, it has been discovered that also bacteria release ATP into the extracellular space . Such ATP release might be a conserved process of protection from host defense and precede host responses. ATP release has been shown for a variety of bacteria including the sepsis-associated Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Klebsiella pneumoniae ( K. pneumoniae ) from the Proteobacteria phylum or Enterococcus faecalis ( E. faecalis ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) from the Firmicutes phylum .

[ABSTRACT] In children, psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ) are related to risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. Maladaptive cognitive functioning, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, is hypothesized to mediate the relationship between these factors and childhood PLEs. Using large-scale longitudinal data, we tested the relationships of genetic and environmental factors ( such as familial and neighborhood environment ) with cognitive intelligence and their relationships with current and future PLEs in children. We leveraged large-scale multimodal data of 6, 602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. Linear mixed model and a new structural equation modeling ( SEM ) method that allows estimation of both components and factors were used to estimate the joint effects of cognitive phenotypes polygenic scores ( PGSs ), familial and neighborhood socioeconomic status ( SES ), and supportive environment on NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence and PLEs. We adjusted for ethnicity ( genetically defined ), schizophrenia PGS, and additionally unobserved confounders ( using computational confound modeling ). Our findings indicate that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs are significantly associated with lower PGSs for cognitive phenotypes, lower familial SES, lower neighborhood SES, and less supportive environments. Specifically, cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs. This study underscores the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through their effects on cognitive intelligence. Our findings have policy implications in that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children. Childhood is the critical developmental period in human life. Cognitive intelligence and mental health in this period significantly impact key life outcomes at later ages, including academic performance, economic productivity, physical health, intelligence, and psychopathology . Literature shows the significant impact of social adversities on cognitive ability and mental health in early childhood. Lower family socioeconomic status ( SES ), particularly household income, is linked to lower neurocognitive ability and higher risk of psychopathology in childhood . Additional to family SES, the importance of neighborhood social environment on children’s neurocognitive ability has been also emphasized . Adverse neighborhood environment, such as the percent of families below poverty line, low education levels, and exposure to violence, is associated with lower cognitive performance ( CP ) and a greater risk for psychosis in children . Conversely, as protective factors against familial and neighborhood socioeconomic challenges, supportive parenting and positive school environment have been highlighted to improve child cognition and mental health. Psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ), which are prevalent in childhood, indicate the risk of psychosis . Although they are not a direct precursor of schizophrenia, children reporting PLEs in ages of 9–11 years are at higher risk of psychotic disorders in adulthood . PLEs also point toward the potential for other psychopathologies including mood, anxiety, and substance disorders , are linked to deficits in cognitive intelligence and show a stronger association with environmental risk factors during childhood than other internalizing/externalizing symptoms . Maladaptive cognitive intelligence may act as a mediator for the effects of genetic and environmental risks on the manifestation of psychotic symptoms . Abnormal neurodevelopment, influenced by genetic factors, combined with disrupted cognitive processes resulting from socioenvironmental adversity, may eventually give rise to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, relevant to PLEs .

[ABSTRACT] The morphogen FGF8 establishes graded positional cues imparting regional cellular responses via modulation of early target genes. The roles of FGF signaling and its effector genes remain poorly characterized in human experimental models mimicking early fetal telencephalic development. We used hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro platform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation. We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids. Within telencephalic regions, FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity. Moreover, FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, our results show that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development. The embryonic development of the mammalian brain is orchestrated by a highly coordinated cascade of cellular and molecular events. This cascade engages distinct signaling pathways activated by gradients of diffusing morphogens, including FGFs, BMPs, SHH, and WNTs . These morphogens instruct neural progenitors with spatial and temporal ‘coordinates’ along the dorsoventral ( D/V ) and anteroposterior ( A/P ) brain axes, modulating early expression gradients of key developmental genes in a dose-dependent manner. These initial stages lay the foundation for further critical processes in brain development, such as progenitor proliferation, cell migration, neuronal differentiation, and circuit formation. Disruption of any of these mechanisms can lead to multiple morphological abnormalities, and contribute to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders ( NDDs ). FGF ligands and their receptors play pivotal roles in neural plate patterning , and disruptions in FGF signaling pathways have been implicated in various brain malformations and significant cortical development defects . Notably, although some functional redundancy exists among FGF factors , FGF8 stands out as a primary regulator of regional patterning and brain development. During early development, FGF8 is essential in establishing the midbrain-hindbrain boundary - a region known as the isthmus, which acts as a brain organizer - where the FGF8 diffusing gradient controls the patterning of posterior brain regions . During the development of telencephalic vesicles, FGF8 diffuses from the anterior neural ridge , located at the most anterior pole, creating a gradient that regulates proliferation, apoptosis, regionalization, and identity acquisition along cortical axes . Consistently, FGF8 diffusion is essential for the regulation of key telencephalic genes such as Foxg1 , a transcription factor required for the regionalization and growth of telencephalic vesicles. Additionally, FGF8 promotes cortical expansion by activating the ERK signaling pathway, thereby enhancing self-renewal and increasing the pool of cortical radial glia cells . FGFs exert their functions by binding to four highly conserved FGF receptors ; among those, FGFR3 plays a specific role in regulating brain size by influencing progenitor proliferation and apoptosis and is essential for the correct formation and regionalization of the occipitotemporal cortex . Given their multiple roles during embryonic and adult age , it is not surprising that FGF factors have been implicated in the onset of several NDDs , and adult psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia . FGF8 exerts its effects by modulating key developmental genes, which, in turn, directly or indirectly control critical neurogenesis processes.

[ABSTRACT] Sleep and feeding patterns lack strong daily rhythms during early life. As diurnal animals mature, feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. In Drosophila, circadian sleep patterns are initiated with formation of a circuit connecting the central clock to arousal output neurons; emergence of circadian sleep also enables long-term memory ( LTM ). However, the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown. Here, we identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosophila larvae. We find that in the 2nd instar larval period ( L2 ), sleep and feeding are spread across the day; these behaviors become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage ( L3 ). Forcing mature ( L3 ) animals to adopt immature ( L2 ) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit LTM. In addition, the development of the clock ( DN1a ) -arousal ( Dh44 ) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Finally, we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. Together, our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors. The development of behavioral rhythms such as sleep-wake patterns is critical for brain development . Indeed, early life circadian disruptions in rodents negatively impacts adult behaviors, neuronal morphology, and circadian physiology . Likewise, in humans, disruptions in sleep and rhythms during development are a common co-morbidity in neurodevelopmental disorders including ADHD and autism . Although mechanisms encoding the molecular clock are well understood, little is known about how rhythmic behaviors first emerge . In particular, cues that trigger the consolidation of sleep and waking behaviors as development proceeds are unclear . A key potential factor in the maturation of sleep patterns is the coincident change in feeding and metabolism during development. Early in development, most young animals must obtain enough nutrients to ensure proper growth . Yet, developing organisms must also sleep to support nervous system development . These conflicting needs ( feeding vs. quiescence ) result in rapid transitions between sleeping and feeding states early in life . As development proceeds, nutritional intake and storage capacity increase, allowing for the consolidation of feeding and sleep to specific times of day . These changes in nutritional storage capacity are likely conserved as mammalian body composition and nutritional capacity change over infant development and Drosophila show rapid increases in overall larval body size including the size of the fat body ( used for nutrient storage ) across development . However, the role that developmental change in metabolic drive plays in regulating the consolidation of behavioral rhythms is not known. In adult Drosophila, sleep and feeding behaviors are consolidated to specific times of day with flies eating more in the day than the night . Yet, early in development, sleep in 2nd instar Drosophila larvae ( L2 ) lacks a circadian pattern . We previously determined that sleep-wake rhythms are initiated in early 3rd instar Drosophila larvae ( L3 ) ( 72 hr AEL ). DN1a clock neurons anatomically and functionally connect to Dh44 arousal output neurons to drive the consolidation of sleep in L3. Development of this circuit promotes deeper sleep in L3 resulting in the emergence of long-term memory ( LTM ) capabilities at the L3 stage but not before .

[ABSTRACT] Many animals moving through fluids exhibit highly coordinated group movement that is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion. However, direct energetic measurements demonstrating the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements remain elusive. By characterizing both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools of giant danio ( Devario aequipinnatus ), we discovered that fish schools have a concave upward shaped metabolism–speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at ~1 body length s-1. We demonstrate that fish schools reduce total energy expenditure ( TEE ) per tail beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. When reaching their maximum sustained swimming speed, fish swimming in schools had a 44% higher maximum aerobic performance and used 65% less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary individuals, which lowered the TEE and total cost of transport by up to 53%, near the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism. Fish in schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. The non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance which is likely to be beneficial for evading predators. These energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes. Newton’s laws of motion underpin animal locomotion, from fine-scale maneuvers to long-distance migrations . As speed increases or during migration involving sustained movement over long distances, animals often move in coordinated groups: e. g., migratory birds in V-formation , ducklings swimming in formation , cyclists in a peloton , elite marathon runners , and fish schools . To overcome gravitational or fluid dynamic resistance to forward motion, animals use both aerobic and glycolytic metabolism ( oxidative and substrate-level phosphorylation at the cellular level ) to generate energy and sustain movement in the air, on land, and in the water. In water, a fluid that is 50 times more viscous than air and contains much less O2 per Kg than air, the need for aquatic animals to reduce fluid dynamic drag for energy conservation is even greater than for aerial or terrestrial locomotion. Hence, we use fish schooling behavior as a model system to explore whether the fluid dynamics of collective movement can enable energetic savings compared to locomotion by a solitary individual. Fish schooling behaviors are some of the most prominent social and group activities exhibited by vertebrates. Fish may school for many reasons, including foraging, reproduction, and migration, and fish schools often exhibit high-speed movement during evasion from predators. Hence, natural selection can put pressure on the formation of schools and individual interactions within a school. Besides ‘safety in numbers’ where individuals in a large school have a lower probability of becoming prey, can there be more tangible energetic benefits of high-speed swimming as a school ? Since fluid drag scales as velocity squared , movement at higher speeds places a premium on mechanisms to conserve energy. Fast and unsustainable swimming is fueled by aerobic metabolism with a major contribution from anaerobic glycolysis . During high-speed swimming aerobic capacity is maximized , and energy use is more likely to compete with other activities than in low-speed swimming which only occupies a small portion of aerobic capacity. The direct consequences of unsustainably engaging anaerobic glycolysis include both fatigue and metabolic perturbation ( such as changing blood acidity ) that need time to recover after bouts of intense locomotion.

[ABSTRACT] Airway macrophages ( AM ) are the predominant immune cell in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection, making them a target for host directed therapy. Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism. A knowledge gap remains in understanding metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations, especially in lung resident AM. We examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM; as a model of blood derived macrophages ) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. Human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or upon stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM do not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM which shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. These data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases. Airway macrophages ( AM ) are the sentinels of the lung and the first responders to respiratory insults such as infection. Despite a large body of evidence indicating that these tissue resident AM have a distinct phenotype and function to peripherally derived macrophages, there remains a significant lack of data regarding human AM function and plasticity in response to infection and their ability to change under the influence of Th1 or Th2 environments. Macrophage function exists on a spectrum of activation states based on tissue residency, ontogeny, cytokine milieu and the plasticity of the macrophage in response to environmental factors . Much of the research has focused on the contribution of metabolic pathways to polarising macrophages into distinct pro-inflammatory or regulatory phenotypes . There is a paucity of data on the role of metabolism in response to Th1 or Th2 microenvironments induced by cytokines such as IFN-γ or IL-4 respectively, in human macrophages, especially in tissue resident macrophages, such as AM. A knowledge gap remains as to whether the tissue resident AM is metabolically and functionally plastic and therefore capable of mounting effective pro-inflammatory responses despite its homeostatic, regulatory tissue resident phenotype. Plasticity of macrophage function requires metabolic reprogramming . Since AM play a key role in directing and propagating immune responses and inflammation in the lung, we sought to determine the plasticity of AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ). Using primary human AM and MDM, we modelled Th1 and Th2 microenvironments with the addition of IFN-γ or IL-4, respectively. To further examine the function of IFN-γ or IL-4 primed macrophages, we stimulated cells with the gram-negative bacterial component, lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), or whole bacteria, irradiated Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb; iH37Rv ). Firstly, we assessed the metabolic phenotype of unprimed human AM, or primed with IFN-γ or IL-4.

[ABSTRACT] For the first time in any animal, we show that nocturnal bull ants use the exceedingly dim polarisation pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation. The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy, or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and solar polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces an analogous pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Here, we show evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that these bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we show the long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants’ path integration system throughout the night for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day. Many, navigating animals use the position of the sun or moon to guide their movement . Yet these celestial bodies are not always directly visible, often obscured by clouds, the canopy, or after passing below the horizon, resulting in gaps for navigation relying solely upon direct visual detection. Animals hence rely on the pattern of polarised skylight, which is accessible even when the celestial bodies are occluded to some extent . When the electromagnetic field of light oscillates in a directionally predictable manner, it is defined as polarised. The type of polarisation describes the pattern of this oscillating electromagnetic field. When this oscillation is in a single plane, this light is defined as linearly polarised. The electric field of light can form other patterns, such as circular polarisation, with the field spiralling in three dimensions as a plane wave propagates. Linearly polarised sunlight comprises light waves which occur along a single plane produced as a by-product of light passing through the upper atmosphere . The scattering of this light creates an e-vector pattern in the sky, which is arranged in concentric circles around the sun or moon’s position with the maximum degree of polarisation located 90° from the source. Hence when the sun/moon is near the horizon, the pattern of polarised skylight is particularly simple with uniform direction of polarisation approximately parallel to the north-south axes . The pattern’s stability makes the sky’s polarisation a useful directional cue for orientation , which insects detect through specialised photoreceptors located in the dorsal rim area of their eyes . Like solar polarisation, though a million times weaker, the moon reflects sunlight, producing a polarised moonlight pattern emanating from the moon’s position in the night sky . Given that the moon creates a much dimmer version of the polarisation pattern formed around the sun, only night-navigating insects with eyes highly specialised for low-light detection may be able to rely on this pattern to orient and navigate to goals.

[ABSTRACT] Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight. Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here, we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure. Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight . The first pterosaurs, the non-pterodactyloids, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base , similar to some dinosaurs like Velociraptor . Many of these tails end in a soft tissue 'vane' , which may have contributed to passive stability in flight. A primary role in display has also been suggested , given ontogenetic shape changes in the vane and the fact that, unlike most aircraft, flying animals do not need vertical control surfaces to be yaw-stable during turns . The vanes have been interpreted as steering aids . The length and stiffening of the tails suggest that they might have been important in early pterosaurs for control based on mass shifting or inertial control, as purported for terrestrial theropods with convergent tails . Such dynamic control could greatly improve maneuverability and/or stability. However, vane fluttering would be extremely costly and destabilising unless the vane was tensioned while under aerodynamic load. Tail vanes feature thick, evenly spaced, internal structures roughly perpendicular to the caudal series , that are said to resemble neural spines and haemal arches . These structures are presumed to have minimised fluttering and prevented buckling in the same way that spars, ribs, stringers, and longerons do in airplane wings and tail-fins, but others have proposed that they were flexible and cartilaginous , especially since their preserved appearance varies. Here, we use laser-simulated fluorescence ( LSF ) imaging of Rhamphorhynchus specimens from the Upper Jurassic Solnhofen Limestones to investigate the vane’s structural properties, explore its usage, its evolutionary origins and the context for its disappearance in later pterodactyloids . Over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch. Four exceptional specimens were then imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence ( LSF ). Three specimens - NHMUK PV OR 37787, NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 and ROM VP 55352 - exhibited tail vanes under white light, but the vane of NHMUK PV OR 37003 was only visible under LSF. LSF confirmed the soft tissue extent of the vanes and revealed hidden anatomical details, especially in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 ( Figure 2A–C ), where vane areas fluoresced pink and white, indicating soft tissue preservation . Tail vanes are sub-symmetrical and diamond-shaped in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 with a length of 700 mm, 750 mm, and 720 mm making up 21%, 22% and 21% of the total tail length of 320 mm, 362 mm, and 348 mm, respectively ( Figure 2 ).

[ABSTRACT] Adolescence is characterized by changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making. These behavioral changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood, but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders. Major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie, in part, the associated behavioral changes and increased vulnerability. Here, we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine differences in dopamine release as well as mechanisms that underlie differential dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of adolescent ( P28-35 ) and adult ( P70-90 ) male rats. We show baseline differences between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in male rats, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) on modulating dopamine release. The α6-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats, but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood. Strikingly, blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that this α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. We confirm the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo using microdialysis. Results herein suggest a multisynaptic process potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release. Adolescence is the transitional period between childhood and adulthood characterized by changes in behaviors, such as increases in risk-taking, sensation seeking, and peer-focused sociality . These behavioral changes are thought to be evolutionarily advantageous, as they allow for the exploration necessary for a transition to independence . However, adolescence is also a time of increased vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders ( SUD ), schizophrenia, and affective disorders, that can persist into adulthood . Adolescent onset is also associated with increased severity of a range of psychiatric disorders . This may be, in part, because the brain is still developing during this vulnerable period and disturbances, such as drug-taking or stress, may disrupt the natural developmental trajectory. Thus, understanding how the adolescent brain develops in a normative state may help us pinpoint how and why this system is perturbed in disease. Reorganization of the dopamine system is hypothesized to underlie many of the changes in adolescent behavior, particularly in reward-related learning and decision-making, and the increased vulnerability to developing psychiatric disorders . Preclinical research indicates that the dopamine system is going through major changes in adolescence. For example, the density of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum, firing rate of dopamine neurons, and dopamine synthesis all peak during adolescence . While reports examining extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum show both lower and higher levels of dopamine during adolescence , sub-second stimulated dopamine release is consistently found to be decreased in the striatum of adolescent rats . Our lab has previously shown that the maximum concentration of evoked dopamine release is decreased in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of early adolescent male rats , though the process responsible for differentially regulating dopamine release in adolescent and adult rats remains unclear. Since previous research from our lab revealed that the NAc core has the largest difference in stimulated dopamine release between adult and adolescent male rats , we focused this report on understanding the mechanisms mediating dopamine release in that region.

[ABSTRACT] Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is defined by common behavioral characteristics, raising the possibility of shared pathogenic mechanisms. Yet, vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity suggests personalized phenotypes. Surprisingly, our iPSC studies find that six individuals from two distinct ASD subtypes, idiopathic and 16p11. 2 deletion, have common reductions in neural precursor cell ( NPC ) neurite outgrowth and migration even though whole genome sequencing demonstrates no genetic overlap between the datasets. To identify signaling differences that may contribute to these developmental defects, an unbiased phospho- ( p ) -proteome screen was performed. Surprisingly despite the genetic heterogeneity, hundreds of shared p-peptides were identified between autism subtypes including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in all NPCs across both ASD subtypes, and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism NPC-associated phenotypes in control NPCs. Thus, our studies demonstrate that genetically distinct ASD subtypes have common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration which are driven by the shared pathogenic process of mTOR signaling dysregulation. Autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) are characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication and the presence of repetitive and restrictive interests and behaviors. Though these common impairments define ASD, there is marked heterogeneity in both clinical presentation and etiological underpinnings among affected individuals . In turn, this heterogeneity raises the possibility that there are ‘different’ ASD subtypes . Yet, despite this heterogeneity, all autism subtypes are united by their core behavioral phenotypes. Consequently, we postulate that there may be common pathways linking different autism subtypes. Yet, few studies have compared multiple ASD subtypes to investigate possible commonalities. About 10–15% of autism cases are genetically defined and caused by single gene mutations or copy number variants ( CNVs ) while most of ASD etiology remains undefined or idiopathic. Yet, much of our knowledge of ASD pathophysiology is derived from rodent studies of syndromic rare variant genes. Consequently, our insight into a majority of ASD pathophysiology has been limited and we have little knowledge of the similarities and differences between idiopathic and genetically defined autisms. Several studies have uncovered the convergence of both rare and common variant ASD risk genes onto the developing mid-fetal cerebral cortex ( 8–24 weeks ) . During this period, neural precursor cells ( NPCs ) undergo proliferation, migration, and differentiation to form neurons and establish normal brain cytoarchitecture . Now, with the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) technology, we can study human neural development in cells derived from individuals with both genetic and idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders. iPSC studies of monogenic, CNV, and idiopathic ASD have observed alterations in basic developmental processes, such as synapse formation . However, many of these studies focused on terminally differentiated neurons, with very few examining developmental events that correspond to mid-fetal cortical development that precede synapse formation, such as neurite outgrowth and cell migration . Moreover, there is little insight into whether and how extracellular factors ( EFs ), which coordinate neurodevelopment by regulating signaling, contribute to ASD pathogenesis in human NPCs. To begin addressing these questions, we studied early neurite development and cell migration using human iPSC-derived NPCs from two different autism subtypes – an idiopathic cohort ( I-ASD ) and a genetically defined CNV 16p11. 2 deletion ( 16pDel ) cohort. We demonstrate remarkable convergence in neurite and migration phenotypes despite whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) showing no genetic overlap between the datasets.

[ABSTRACT] Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells ( IHCs ) and spiral ganglion neurons ( SGNs ) in the cochlea. Presynaptic active zones at the pillar IHC side activate at lower IHC potentials than those of the modiolar side that have more presynaptic Ca2+ channels. The postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds, and operating ranges. While a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity seems likely, experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has remained difficult to obtain. Here, we aimed at bridging this gap by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate of release ( SR ) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs. Chemical synapses represent diverse and plastic neural contacts that are adapted to the specific needs of neural computation. Synaptic diversity is expressed across the nervous system, within a given circuit and even within the same neuron . Synaptic diversity occurs at various levels: from synapse shape and size, to the ultrastructure of pre- and postsynaptic specializations, to their molecular composition. The auditory system harbors striking examples of synaptic diversity. Glutamatergic ribbon synapses in the cochlea, calyceal synapses in the brainstem, and bouton synapses throughout the central auditory system differ greatly from each other . Beyond the diversity across synapses formed by different neurons and at different places , heterogeneity exists even among auditory synapses formed by an individual presynaptic inner hair cell ( IHC ) with its 5–30 postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons . Synaptic heterogeneity has been found at different tonotopic positions of the cochlea and is a candidate process for how the cochlea decomposes acoustic information . For example, the cochlea might use heterogeneous afferent synapses to break down sound intensity information into complementary spike rate codes of SGNs that have been reported along the tonotopic axis of the cochlea for several species . Decades of in vivo recordings from single SGNs have demonstrated functional diversity of SGNs with comparable frequency tuning, i. e., receiving input from IHCs at a given tonotopic place or potentially even the same IHC. Such functional diversity is present in both spontaneous and sound-evoked firing. The spontaneous firing rate ( SR ) in the absence of sound varies from less than 1 spikes/s to more than 100 spikes/s . In response to increasing sound pressure, SGNs with high SR show a low sound threshold and a steep rise in the spike rate to increasing sound intensities until the rate saturates. SGNs with low SR have a higher sound thresholds, shallower spike rate rise, and saturate at higher sound intensities . Additionally, SGNs show differences in their excitability , morphological features and heterogeneous molecular profiles .

[ABSTRACT] The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia ( MORC ) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms. Accumulating evidence has shed light on the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. In this study, using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches, we demonstrate that PfMORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, but is also essential to the parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) experiments suggests that PfMORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but may also play a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture ( Hi-C ) studies indicate that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death. All together these findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for new antimalarial strategies. Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Among the five human-infecting species, Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest, with over 619, 000 deaths in 2023 . To adapt to extreme environmental challenges, P. falciparum possesses unique strategies that direct the tightly coordinated changes in gene expression and control transcriptional switching in genes encoded by multigene families to ensure antigenic variation and immune evasion. Changes in gene expression throughout the parasite life cycle are controlled by a surprisingly low repertoire of transcription factors ( TFs ) encoded in the Plasmodium genome . The 27 apicomplexan APETALA2 ( ApiAP2 ) DNA-binding proteins are the only well-documented parasite TFs known to contribute to the modulation of gene expression throughout various stages of the parasite’s development . Since the discovery of the AP2 gene family , evidence has alluded to their role as master regulators of gene expression throughout transitory phases of the parasite life cycle. The most well-documented are the gametocyte-specific TFs ( AP2-G, AP2-G2 ) with the subsequent discovery of those associated with a transition to sexual differentiation as well as sporozoite ( AP2-SP ) and liver stages ( AP2-L ) . The Plasmodium genome, however, encompasses well over 5, 000 protein-coding genes suggesting there are most likely other molecular components responsible for gene expression. It is believed that, to offset the relatively low TF range, Plasmodium has evolved additional mechanisms regulating gene expression including mechanisms that use epigenetics factors, RNA binding proteins, or regulate chromatin structure . All together these components work in combination to regulate the dynamic organization of DNA, and the cascade of gene expression required for the parasite life cycle progression . Despite their importance, the identification and functional characterization of regulatory players controlling chromatin remains a challenge in this intractable organism. However, with the advent of sensitive technologies capable of capturing important chromatin associated regulatory complexes such as ChIP, chromatin conformation capture ( Hi-C ) technologies, and chromatin enrichment for proteomics ( ChEP ), we can now solve important facets of molecular components controlling epigenetics and chromatin structure.

[ABSTRACT] Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing, we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors ( decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running ). Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer. The prevalence of mental health disorders ( e. g. depression, anxiety, suicide ) in cancer patients is significantly greater than in the general population . For those patients with no prior psychiatric history, a cancer diagnosis increases the risk of mental health decline . The presence of cancer introduces many stressors ( physical, financial, relational ) into the lives of patients, thus a negative impact on mental health may not be surprising. However, these changes persist even in long-term cancer survivors. For instance, decade-long cancer survivors maintain an increased incidence of depression ( approximately 12%, depending on the cancer type ) as compared to the population at large . While the intensity and prevalence of psychological symptoms in cancer patients fluctuate before, during, and after treatment for a given type of cancer, and between cancer types, it remains higher than in the general population . The association of cancer with impaired mental health is directly mediated by the disease, its treatment or both; these findings suggest that the development of a tumor alters brain functions. We have demonstrated the presence of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas , melanoma , cervical , and ovarian cancers . Nerve recruitment to the tumor bed is an active process that involves the release of soluble factors, including neurotrophins and neuropeptides . Tumor-released small extracellular vesicles ( sEVs ) also recruit loco-regional nerves to the tumor bed . While these and other studies establish that solid peripheral tumors engage with the peripheral nervous system , it raises the possibility of a direct neuronal connection from the tumor to the brain. A recent study used pseudorabies virus and mapped a connection from tumor-infiltrating nerves in an orthotopic model of murine lung cancer to areas in the brain . We expand these findings and demonstrate that HNSCC-associated nerves are transcriptionally and functionally altered and project to discrete regions in the brain. The brain neurons connected to the tumor manifest increased activity, which is associated with behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing animals. Consistent with this, newly diagnosed HNSCC patients suffer high rates of depression and anxiety and lower quality of life . As most cancer patients face cancer-related pain , we tested whether treating pain could restore normal behavior. While pain treatment restored normal function at the tumor site, such as nesting behavior, it only partially restored normal voluntary running wheel behavior.

[ABSTRACT] Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success. Taking advantage of the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2, we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. We find variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) sufficient to allow local plasticity, but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses. In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants, we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties, and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation. A picture emerges where genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, in particular in the IDRs. A salient characteristic of RNA viruses is their high error rate in transcription and their resulting quasispecies nature . This diversity is also reflected in the ensemble of consensus sequences sampled across the infected host population, as is apparent in the GISAID ( Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data ) repository of SARS-CoV-2 genomes . With currently ≈15 million entries, this unprecedented large database has provided the basis for phylogenetic analyses that have identified critical amino acid mutations associated with immune evasion, infectivity, and disease severity, and allowed the rapid identification of variants of concern . The vast majority of mutations, however, seem inconsequential in that they usually do not lead to any fixed substitutions. Nonetheless, the mutant spectrum exhaustively describes a landscape of amino acids that may occupy any position in the viral proteins, as in a natural deep mutational scan . Biophysical constraints implicit in the shape of such landscapes are key to understand the function and molecular evolution of viral proteins . Unfortunately, the wealth of genomic information on SARS-CoV-2 stands in stark contrast with our knowledge of the phenotypic consequences of sequence mutations. In conjunction with biophysical and structural studies, inspections of local mutations have increased our understanding of mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry, mechanisms of replication and assembly, and interaction with various host factors . Furthermore, the range of naturally occurring mutations at target sites is an important consideration for potential drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics . Outside these focused studies of relatively well-understood hot spots, however, the mutational landscape has remained relatively unexplored. Biophysical fitness landscapes have been studied with regard to observables such as thermal stability of globular proteins, solvent accessibility, catalytic activity, or binding affinity of protein-protein interfaces, which has led to significant advances in understanding relationship between molecular properties, population fitness, and evolutionary processes . However, it was found that constraints for evolution of intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) are much different from those of globular proteins . Generally, intrinsic disorder and loose packing is a common characteristic of many RNA virus proteins , which is thought to promote functional promiscuity, permit greater diversity, and enhance evolvability to adopt new functions with few mutations .

[ABSTRACT] Hibernation is a period of metabolic suppression utilized by many small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods. As the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood, our study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization. We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus and larger hibernators, Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus. We then conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand. In parallel, we performed multiple proteomics analyses. Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation, whilst in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor unexpectedly led to higher levels in energy expenditure of type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures ( 20 °C ). Upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8 °C ( near the body temperature of torpid animals ), we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77–107% during torpor compared to active periods. Additionally, we observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemilineatus, which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule. This may act as a potential molecular process mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure. Altogether, we demonstrate that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observe that it is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potentially contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis. Hibernation is an adaptive strategy employed by many animals aiming to decrease their metabolic rate and improve survival, particularly during harsh, winter conditions where food supply is limited, and thermogenic demands are high . During hibernation, mammals typically undergo a decrease in body temperature, heart, and breathing rates . In so-called fat-storing hibernators, this is inherently accompanied by prolonged fasting and fatty acids become the main substrate for energy provision . Besides these common features associated with overall metabolic depression, there are also significant inter-species differences in the underlying strategies. For instance, small ( <8 kg ) fat-storing hibernating mammals such as 13-lined ground squirrels ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ) or garden dormice ( Eliomys quercinus ) experience extended bouts of a hypo-metabolic state ( torpor ), punctuated by spontaneous periods of interbout euthermic arousals ( IBA ), during which metabolic activity transiently increases back to basal levels. During torpor, metabolic rate decreases below 5% of euthermic values and core body temperatures decrease from 35°C–38°C to 4°C–8°C . In contrast, either medium ( 10–20 kg, e. g. European badger, Meles meles ) or large ( >20 kg, e. g. Eurasian brown bear, Ursus arctos, and American black bear, Ursus americanus ) hibernating mammals exhibit a pronounced hypo-metabolic state ( as low as 25% of their basal metabolic rate in the case of bears ), but only experience a mild decline in body temperature ( to 32–35°C depending on body size ) that lasts for several winter months . While species-specific physiological patterns are well-documented, the molecular and cellular mechanisms operative in individual organs to achieve these remain largely undefined. Skeletal muscle constitutes approximately 45–55% of body mass and serves as a major determinant of basal metabolic rate and heat production .

[ABSTRACT] Chondrocyte columns, which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation. Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Broadly, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development. Cellular organization plays a major role in tissue and organ morphogenesis . The mammalian growth plate is an excellent example for this concept as its complex architecture is the engine driving longitudinal bone growth . The growth plate, which is located at both ends of developing long bones, drives bone elongation by a tightly regulated process of cell proliferation and differentiation, which involves increase in cell size and their organization along the proximal-distal ( P-D ) axis . The growth plate comprises four zones. At the most distal epiphyseal end is the resting zone ( RZ ), where chondrocytes are small and disorganized. Underneath lies the proliferative zone ( PZ ), where chondrocytes increase in volume, adopt a flat and elongated morphology, and organize into columns . In the subsequent prehypertrophic ( PHZ ) and hypertrophic zones ( HZ ), cells reach their maximum size . These changes in cell size and spatial organization determine the rate of bone elongation . Columnar arrangement of chondrocytes has been a subject of study for nearly a century , gaining attention due to the remarkable emergence of cellular order from the highly disordered RZ. This columnar arrangement facilitates bone elongation by maximizing cell density in the longitudinal axis while limiting it laterally, thereby constraining hypertrophic cell growth to the P-D axis . In the PZ, the division of column-forming cells is perpendicular to the P-D axis. Considering that these cells ultimately orient themselves with their short axis parallel to the P-D axis, the rearrangement into elongated columns requires a strong morphogenetic process. Originally, analyses of two-dimensional static images suggested that in the embryonic growth plate, columns form through a process akin to convergent extension, an evolutionarily conserved tissue elongation process involving cell intercalation . However, more recent live imaging studies in various model systems showed that cells do not intercalate to form columns . Instead, following cell division, sister cells undergo a cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix ( ECM ) adhesion-dependent 90° rotation prior to separation.

[ABSTRACT] Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters ( POTs ) are of great pharmaceutical interest owing to their promiscuous substrate binding site that has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs. Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient. Cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have recently provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2. Nevertheless, these studies leave open important questions regarding the process of proton and substrate coupling, while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations. Here, we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces. By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Our results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy ( ABFE ) calculations also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underpining secondary active transport in POTs. This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability. Cells require an external lipid membrane to separate their internal cytoplasm from the environment. Since the membrane permeability of common solutes spans ten orders of magnitude, some molecules diffuse readily across the membrane, while the translocation of others requires facilitation by carriers . Understanding the processes by which small molecules cross membranes is of key pharmacological interest owing to their role in drug delivery, which may be mediated by passive diffusion, protein carriers, or a combination of both . The solute-carrier ( SLC ) superfamily encompasses 65 families of more than 450 genes, with substrates ranging in size from simple ions to complex macromolecules used in metabolism and signalling . Within this superfamily, the SLC15 family includes POTs that have significant homology through all domains of life and are evolutionarily ancient . Of the four mammalian family members, PepT1 ( SLC15A1 ), and PepT2 ( SLC15A2 ) are the most well studied. The former is predominantly expressed in the small intestine and characterised as a low-aﬃnity, high-capacity transporter . The latter has a broader expression pattern including the kidneys, lungs, and brain and is described as high-aﬃnity, low-capacity . As secondary-active transporters, they couple uphill substrate translocation to the symport of protons down their electrochemical gradient . The peptide–proton stoichiometry is not conserved between different substrates and POT family members . For PepT1, stoichiometries of 1:1 and 2:1 have been reported for neutral/basic and acidic di-peptides, respectively . For PepT2, a 2:1 stoichiometry was reported for the neutral di-peptide D-Phe-L-Ala and 3:1 for anionic D-Phe-L-Glu . Alternatively, Fei et al., 1999 have found 1:1 stoichiometries for either of D-Phe-L-Gln ( neutral ), D-Phe-L-Glu ( anionic ), and D-Phe-L-Lys ( cationic ). Here, we work under the assumption of a 2:1 stoichiometry for neutral di-peptides, motivated also by our computational results that indicate distinct and additive roles played by two protons in the conformational cycle process.

[ABSTRACT] Across the animal kingdom, neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization, and humans are no exception. A common idea is that suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback, enabling the detection of vocalization errors. This idea has been previously confirmed in non-human primates, however a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring remains elusive. To address this issue, we obtained intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production. We first characterized the detailed topography of auditory suppression, which varied across superior temporal gyrus ( STG ). Next, we performed a delayed auditory feedback ( DAF ) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations. Indeed, overlapping sites showed enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. Importantly, there was a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity, suggesting suppression might be a key process that underlies speech monitoring. Further, we found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback, posterior STG was selectively activated if participants were engaged in a DAF model, suggesting that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity. A major question in neuroscience is how do animals distinguish between stimuli originating from the environment and those produced by their own actions. Sensorimotor circuits share a common process across the animal kingdom in which sensory responses to self-generated motor actions are suppressed. It is commonly hypothesized that suppressing responses to predicted self-generated stimuli increases sensitivity of the sensory system to external stimuli . Furthermore, it enables detection and correction of motor errors by providing a template of the predicted sensory outcome to compare with the actual sensory outcome. In the domain of speech, this process is described in models which suggest that neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during speech production. When there is a mismatch between the predicted auditory outcome and the actual auditory feedback, responses in the auditory regions are enhanced to encode the mismatch and inform vocal-motor regions to correct vocalization . A common experimental strategy to generate mismatch between the predicted auditory outcome and the actual auditory feedback is to perturb auditory feedback during speech production. Auditory feedback perturbations are usually applied either by delaying auditory feedback ( DAF ), which disrupts speech fluency , or by shifting voice pitch and formants, which result in compensatory vocal changes in the opposite direction of the shift . Numerous electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies investigated neural responses during speech production both in the absence and presence of auditory feedback perturbations. In support of speech production models, these studies have repeatedly reported suppressed responses in auditory cortex during speaking compared with passive listening to speech , as well as enhanced responses when auditory feedback was perturbed indicating sensitivity to auditory feedback . However, it is not clear whether the same or distinct neural populations in the auditory cortex show speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback. While auditory responses are largely suppressed during speech production, detailed investigations using neurosurgical recordings revealed that the degree of suppression was variable across cortical sites, and auditory cortex also exhibited non-suppressed and enhanced responses ( albeit less common ) , mirroring results from non-human primate studies using single-unit recordings . In the same non-human primate study, it was reported that neurons that were suppressed during vocalization showed increased activity when auditory feedback was perturbed .

[ABSTRACT] A comprehensive census of McrBC systems, among the most common forms of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems, followed by phylogenetic analysis, reveals their enormous abundance in diverse prokaryotes and a plethora of genomic associations. We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch, which we denote coiled-coil nuclease tandems ( CoCoNuTs ) for their salient features: the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. The CoCoNuTs alone show extraordinary variety, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes. All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components, such as OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein that binds bacterial transfer-messenger RNA ( tmRNA ), YTH-like domains that might recognize methylated tmRNA, tRNA, or rRNA, and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs, along with RNases, such as HEPN domains, all suggesting that the CoCoNuTs target RNA. Many CoCoNuTs might additionally target DNA, via McrC nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III, are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons. In many of these superoperons, CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly, RNA fragments with cyclic termini, that bind associated CARF ( CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold ) domains. We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs, together with the ancillary restriction factors, employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, in which an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first, but then, if it fails, an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over. All organisms are subject to an incessant barrage of genetic parasites, such as viruses and transposons. Over billions of years, the continuous arms race between hosts and parasites drove the evolution of immense, intricately interconnected networks of diverse defense systems and pathways . In particular, in the last few years, targeted searches for defense systems in prokaryotes, typically capitalizing on the presence of variable genomic defense islands, have dramatically expanded their known diversity and led to the discovery of a plethora of biological conflict strategies and mechanisms . One of the most ancient and common forms of defense against mobile genetic elements ( MGE ) is the targeted restriction of nucleic acids. Since the initial discovery of this activity among strains of bacteria resistant to certain viruses, myriad forms of recognition and degradation of nucleic acids have been described, in virtually all life forms. Characterization of the most prominent of these systems, such as restriction-modification ( RM ), RNA interference ( RNAi ), and CRISPR-Cas ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated genes ), has led to the development of a profusion of highly effective experimental and therapeutic techniques, in particular, genome editing and engineering . Historically, the two-component McrBC ( modified cytosine restriction ) system was the first form of restriction to be described, although the process remained obscure for decades, and for a time, this system was referred to as RglB ( restriction of glucoseless phages ) due to its ability to restrict T-even phage DNA which contained hydroxymethylcytosine, but not glucosylated bases . Today, the prototypical McrBC system, native to Escherichia coil K-12, is considered a Type IV ( modification-dependent ) restriction system that degrades DNA containing methylcytosine ( 5mC ) or hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5hmC ), with a degree of sequence context specificity .

[ABSTRACT] Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions. Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through multiple signaling pathways. Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity, we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ) in C. elegans. Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We demonstrate that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Finally, we show that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the C. elegans DMP and provide a new process for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension. Interventions that enhance lifespan also impart resistance to multiple stresses . Indeed, the positive correlation between improved stress resistance and enhanced lifespan has been exploited to identify long-lived mutants . Among stress responses, innate immunity appears to be a crucial factor for enhanced lifespan . However, the correlation between innate immunity and lifespan is not always positive. Interventions that alter lifespan may not modulate innate immunity, and vice-versa . Some signaling pathways also establish a tradeoff between innate immunity and lifespan. Mutants that have improved immunity but reduced lifespan have been identified . Conversely, mutants with enhanced lifespans but declined immune responses have also been discovered . Moreover, the genetic pathways for lifespan and immunity could be uncoupled in mutants exhibiting enhanced lifespan and improved immune responses . Therefore, the relationship between lifespan and innate immunity appears to be complex and remains to be fully understood. Calcineurin, a conserved protein from yeast to humans, is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is involved in diverse cellular processes and signal transduction pathways . Dephosphorylation of substrate proteins by calcineurin affects several cellular pathways, including transcriptional signaling programs . Calcineurin regulates the activity of the transcription factors of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family . Dephosphorylation of NFATs by calcineurin triggers their nuclear localization and activates immune responses in vertebrates . In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, calcineurin regulates thermotaxis, body size, fertility, and lifespan . Knockdown of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, tax-6, is known to enhance C. elegans lifespan via multiple pathways, including autophagy and CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators . However, the role of calcineurin in regulating C. elegans response to pathogen infections has not been studied. Because C. elegans lacks the NFAT transcription factors , it will be intriguing to study how calcineurin inhibition impacts C. elegans innate immunity. These studies could also shed some light on the complex interplay between lifespan and immunity. In this study, we examined the effect of calcineurin inhibition on C. elegans innate immunity. Surprisingly, we found that the knockdown of tax-6 enhanced the susceptibility of C. elegans to bacterial infection despite enhancing lifespan. We discovered that tax-6 is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ). The knockdown of tax-6 resulted in intestinal bloating due to defects in the DMP, which enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection by increasing gut colonization by bacteria.

[ABSTRACT] Cognitive control resolves conflicts between task-relevant and -irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. As conflicts can arise from different sources ( e. g., sensory input, internal representations ), how a limited set of cognitive control processes can effectively address diverse conflicts remains a major challenge. Based on the cognitive space theory, different conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a ( low-dimensional ) cognitive space, which can then be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes working along the dimensions. It leads to a idea that conflicts similar in their sources are also represented similarly in the cognitive space. We designed a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized. Both human performance and fMRI activity patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex support that different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity, thus suggesting cognitive space as a principle for representing conflicts. Cognitive control enables humans to behave purposefully by modulating neural processing to resolve conflicts between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information. For example, when naming the color of the word ‘BLUE’ printed in red ink, we are likely to be distracted by the word meaning, because reading a word is highly automatic in daily life. To keep our attention on the color, we need to mobilize the cognitive control processes to resolve the conflict between the color and word by boosting/suppressing the processing of color/word meaning. As task-relevant and task-irrelevant information can come from different sources, the sources of conflicts and how they should be resolved can vary greatly . For example, the conflict may occur between items of sensory information, such as between a red light and a police officer signaling cars to pass. Alternatively, conflict may occur between sensory and motor information, such as when a voice on the left asks you to turn right. A key unsolved question in cognitive control is how our brain efficiently resolves these different types of conflicts. A first step to addressing this question is to examine the commonalities and/or dissociations across different types of conflicts that can be categorized into different domains. Examples of the domains of conflicts include experimental model , sensory modality , or conflict type regarding the dimensional overlap of conflict processes . Two solutions to resolving different conflict types are proposed. They differ based on whether the same cognitive control mechanisms are applied across domains. On the one hand, the domain-general cognitive control theories posit that the frontoparietal cortex adaptively encodes task information and can thus flexibly implement control strategies for different types of conflicts. This is supported by the generalizable control adjustment ( i. e., encountering a conflict trial from one type can helped conflict resolution of another type ) and similar neural patterns across distinct conflict tasks. A broader domain-general view holds that the frontoparietal brain regions/networks are widely involved in multiple control demands well beyond the conflict domain , which explains the remarkable flexibility in human behaviors. However, since domain-general processes are by definition likely shared by different tasks, when we need to handle multiple task demands at the same time, the efficiency of both tasks would be impaired due to resource competition or interference . Therefore, the domain-general processes are evolutionarily less advantageous for humans to deal with the diverse situations requiring high efficiency .

[ABSTRACT] Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most cases of preterm birth occur spontaneously and result from preterm labor with intact ( spontaneous preterm labor ) or ruptured ( preterm prelabor rupture of membranes ) membranes. The prediction of spontaneous preterm birth ( sPTB ) remains underpowered due to its syndromic nature and the dearth of independent analyses of the vaginal host immune response. Thus, we conducted the largest longitudinal investigation targeting vaginal immune mediators, referred to herein as the immunoproteome, in a population at high risk for sPTB. Vaginal swabs were collected across gestation from pregnant women who ultimately underwent term birth, sPTL, or PPROM. Cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides in the samples were quantified via specific and sensitive immunoassays. Predictive models were constructed from immune mediator concentrations. Throughout uncomplicated gestation, the vaginal immunoproteome harbors a cytokine network with a homeostatic profile. Yet, the vaginal immunoproteome is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory state in pregnant women who ultimately experience sPTL and PPROM. Such an inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides. The vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk for early ( <34 weeks ) sPTB. The vaginal immunoproteome undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations from this shift are associated with sPTB. Furthermore, the vaginal immunoproteome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early sPTB, a subset of sPTB associated with extremely adverse neonatal outcomes. This research was conducted by the Perinatology Research Branch, Division of Obstetrics and Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Division of Intramural Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services ( NICHD/NIH/DHHS ) under contract HHSN275201300006C. ALT, KRT, and NGL were supported by the Wayne State University Perinatal Initiative in Maternal, Perinatal and Child Health. Preterm birth, defined as live birth before 37 weeks of gestation , afflicts 1 of every 10 children born worldwide . The economic burden of preterm birth amounts to more than $25. 2 billion in healthcare costs annually in the United States alone . Two-thirds of preterm births occur spontaneously ( i. e., spontaneous preterm birth ) , while the remainder are due to evident clinical conditions ( e. g., preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction ) that jeopardize maternal–fetal well-being and require medically indicated delivery ( i. e., iatrogenic preterm birth ) . sPTB can be further subdivided into spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes ( sPTL ) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes ( PPROM ) . The pathogenesis of sPTL and PPROM can include local inflammatory processes ; yet, each is considered a syndrome with distinct underlying mechanisms of disease and thus requiring different clinical managements . Therefore, research focused on the prediction and prevention of sPTB should account for the distinct inflammatory nature of sPTL and PPROM. Multiple attempts have been made to predict sPTB using data from noninvasive sampling coupled with omics platforms such as genomics , transcriptomics , and proteomics . Yet, to date, assessment of cervical length remains the strongest and most cost-effective predictor of sPTB: women with a sonographic short cervix ( ≤ 25 mm ) are sixfold more likely to deliver a preterm neonate , and tailored treatment with natural progesterone reduces such risk by half .

[ABSTRACT] The function of the smooth muscle cells lining the walls of mammalian systemic arteries and arterioles is to regulate the diameter of the vessels to control blood flow and blood pressure. Here, we describe an in silico model, which we call the ‘Hernandez–Hernandez model’, of electrical and Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes based on new experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries. The model suggests the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial blood vessels. Although experimental data suggest that KV1. 5 channel currents have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, simulations suggest that the KV1. 5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes. In female cells, which have larger KV2. 1 channel expression and longer time constants for activation than male myocytes, predictions from simulated female myocytes suggest that KV2. 1 plays a primary role in the control of membrane potential. Over the physiological range of membrane potentials, the gating of a small number of voltage-gated K+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels are predicted to drive sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and excitability. We also show that in an idealized computational model of a vessel, female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca2+ channel blockers compared to male. In summary, we present a new model framework to investigate the potential sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs. Our primary objective was to develop and implement a new computational model that comprehensively describes the essential mechanisms underlying electrical activity and Ca2+ dynamics in arterial myocytes. We aimed to uncover the key components necessary and sufficient to fully understand the behavior of arterial vascular smooth muscle myocytes and the cellular response to variations in pressure. The model represents the first-ever integration of sex-specific variations in voltage-gated KV2. 1 and CaV1. 2 channels, enabling the prediction of sex-specific disparities in membrane potential and the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in smooth muscle cells from systemic arteries. To further investigate sex-specific responses to antihypertensive medications, we extended our investigation to include a one-dimensional ( 1D ) representation of tissue. This approach enabled us to simulate and forecast the effects of Ca2+ channel blockers within the controlled environment of an idealized mesenteric vessel. It is worth noting that this computational framework can be expanded to predict the consequences of antihypertensive drugs and other perturbations, transitioning seamlessly from single-cell to tissue-level simulations. Previous mathematical models of vascular smooth muscle myocytes generated to describe the membrane potential and Ca2+ signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells have described the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) by endogenous or pharmacological vasoactive agents activating inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate ( IP3 ) and ryanodine ( RyR ) receptors, resulting in the initiation of calcium waves. Earlier models have also provided insights into the contraction activation by agonists and the behavior of vasomotion. In a major step forward, the Karlin model incorporated new cell structure data and electrophysiology experimental data in a computational model that predicted the essential behavior of membrane potential and Ca2+ signaling arising from intracellular domains found in arterial myocytes. One notable limitation of earlier models is that they are based entirely on data from male animals. Furthermore, many data used to parameterize the Karlin model were obtained from smooth muscle from cerebral arteries.

[ABSTRACT] Litter decomposition is expected to be positively associated with precipitation despite evidence that decomposers of varying sizes have different moisture dependencies. We hypothesized that higher tolerance of macro-decomposers to aridity may counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers, leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients. We tested this idea by placing plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, and by characterizing the macro-decomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping. We found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size. Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer. This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyper-arid sites. Macro-decomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. Our findings highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands, possibly resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum, and emphasizing the need to contemplate decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes. Litter decomposition is a key process determining elemental cycling in terrestrial ecosystems . Decomposition is controlled by climate, litter quality, and origin, and the identity and abundance of microbial and faunal decomposers . Climate regulates decomposition rates directly, but also indirectly by influencing food-web structure and dynamics . Thus, understanding how climate and decomposers interact is a key step in explaining variation in plant litter decomposition across ecosystems and seasons, and in forecasting the consequences of climate change and biodiversity loss on elemental cycling. Theory suggests that decomposition is positively associated with moisture and temperature . Cross-site studies, reviews, and meta-analyses verified this global pattern, showing that plant litter decomposition in microbial litter bags is indeed faster under warm and wet conditions than under cool and dry conditions . This well accepted realization implicitly assumes that microorganisms dominate plant litter decomposition, largely ignoring the growing recognition that animals may play an important role in litter cycling. This role includes mineralizing and excreting assimilated plant nutrients, fragmenting and partly decomposing plant material, and transporting detritus to microbial havens . Attempts to explore how climate affects faunal decomposition revealed a similar positive association with temperature and precipitation . This global pattern, however, may be confounded by compiling the effect of all decomposer fauna together, ignoring the well-established understanding that soil animals of various size groups respond differently to climate . Specifically, larger arthropods can survive and remain active during hot and dry periods when smaller organisms cannot . Indeed, handful of evidence shows that macro-detritivorous arthropods dominate litter and wood decomposition in warm drylands, especially during warm and dry seasons . This suggests that the conceptualization of how animals and climate interact to regulate decomposition rates requires considering the effects of meso-decomposers and those of macro-decomposers separately, particularly in warm drylands. Detritivorous animals are expected to be exceptionally abundant in arid ecosystems where plant detritus is prevalent year-round but green plant material is available predominantly in short pulses following precipitation events . Macrofauna are physiologically and morphologically more adapted to aridity than mesofauna . Moreover, their large size enables them to remain active during long dry periods by shuttling between existing and self-engineered climatic havens and the hostile foraging grounds on the surface . Consequently, macro-decomposition should be especially important in hot moisture-deprived habitats and periods, whereas the activity of microbes and mesofauna is expected to be minimal. The predicted negative association between moisture and macro-decomposition in drylands may be reversed in hyper-arid environments.

[ABSTRACT] Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carries a dismal prognosis, with high rates of metastasis and few treatment options. Hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all tumours drives RAC1 activation, conferring enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is well understood as a nutrient scavenging process, but little is known about its functions in trafficking of signalling receptors. We find that CYRI-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of Cyrib ( the gene encoding CYRI-B protein ) accelerates tumourigenesis, leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions, indicating a potential role as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis. CYRI-B depleted tumour cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. Overall, we implicate CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) is highly metastatic with low survival rates and few treatment options. PDAC is thought to arise from precancerous non-invasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms ( PanINs ) classified as PanIN1–3 depending on the molecular and histological characteristics . PanINs arise from acinar cells that undergo acinar to ductal metaplasia changes and as mutations accrue, PanINs progress to full PDAC in which angiogenesis, infiltration of stromal cells, and invasion of the basement membrane occur as tumours progress. Metastasis is a complex process and the current gold standard mouse model of metastatic PDAC - the KPC ( KRASG12D, p53R172H, Pdx-1-Cre ) recapitulates multiple features of the human disease . Cytoskeletal and migration-associated proteins have been associated with aggression and metastasis in PDAC both in human patient transcriptomes and in the KPC mouse model , suggesting avenues to pursue against metastatic spread. Downstream of active KRAS, hyperactivation of the small GTPase RAC1 drives proliferation and cytoskeletal remodelling in PDAC and other cancers. Deletion of RAC1 in a KRAS-driven mouse model of PDAC delayed tumour onset, reduced PanIN lesions, and improved survival . This led to the conclusion that dysregulation of RAC1 control of epithelial polarity by active KRAS drives acinar to ductal metaplasia and accelerates tumourigenesis . RAC1 regulates polarity and migration via Scar/WAVE-Arp2/3 control of actin dynamics at cell-cell contacts and at the cell leading edge. Additionally, coordinated RAC1 activation and deactivation are important in macropinocytosis, an actin-driven process whereby cells engulf extracellular substances via large cup-shaped protrusions of the plasma membrane . Extracellular stimulation of cell surface receptors, such as tyrosine kinase or G-protein-coupled receptors, can trigger macropinocytosis via RAC1 and the Scar/WAVE complex . Tumours are frequently starved for amino acids and other nutrients and macropinocytosis is a major way for PDAC tumours to take up proteins, lipids, and cell debris from their environment . Macropinocytosis also provides cells with a process for internalisation of signalling receptors , but whether this has consequences for tumour progression is unknown. Metastasis is a complex process, involving cells breaching through tissue barriers, migrating and settling in distant sites in the body such as the liver, lungs, and peritoneal cavity . Chemotaxis is thought to be a key driver of metastasis and pancreatic cancer cells migrate towards lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) both in vitro and in vivo, contributing to metastasis .

[ABSTRACT] HERV-K ( HML-2 ), the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses ( HERVs ), includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses, but no replication competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates, including rhesus macaques, but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear. We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. Age estimates, intact open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques. 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between env and the 3′ long terminal repeat ( LTR ), derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K ( HML-8 ) -related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys ( OWM ), but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split. We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons. The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3, which disrupt the Rec Response Element ( RcRE ), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. We show that the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element ( CTE ), indicating the ancestral Rec–RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE process. Retroviruses ( Retroviridae ) are a major family of animal viruses, including human viruses capable of causing severe immunodeficiency ( HIV-1 and HIV-2 ) or cancer ( HTLV-1 ) . Uniquely among animal viruses, they must irreversibly integrate their genome into the host genome to replicate . If an infected cell survives, the integrated viral genome, or provirus, will be stably inherited by daughter cells; if a germline cell is infected, the provirus may be inherited by an offspring of the host organism as a heterozygous allele, which may eventually become fixed in the descendant population . Such proviruses and remnants of such proviruses, known as endogenous retroviruses ( ERVs ), form a major fraction of most eukaryotic genomes; in humans, ~8% of the genome is composed of such sequences . These sequences serve as a useful ‘fossil record’ of past viral infections, and can also play important roles in genome evolution, host–viral interactions, and disease; in some animals, such as mice and cats, reactivation and recombination of ERVs with exogenous viruses and/or other ERVs can have severe pathogenic consequences . No replication competent human ERV ( HERV ) has been identified; however, the betaretrovirus-like HERV-K group contains one subgroup, human MMTV-like-2, or HML-2 ( named for its similarity to mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) ), which includes many proviruses with full-length open reading frames ( ORFs ) and other intact functional elements, including two proviruses with full-length ORFs for the four core retroviral proteins Gag, Pro, Pol, and Env . The majority of HML-2 proviruses containing full-length ORFs are within the LTR5Hs subclade, which is the youngest HERV clade and contains many human specific and insertionally polymorphic proviruses that have not yet reached fixation in human populations . Although none of these proviruses are replication competent, two groups have shown that a synthetic consensus young HML-2 provirus is weakly replication competent, and expression of HML-2 RNA and proteins has been observed in a number of different diseases .

[ABSTRACT] Wound infections are highly prevalent and can lead to delayed or failed healing, causing significant morbidity and adverse economic impacts. These infections occur in various contexts, including diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. Enterococcus faecalis is often found in persistent non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied. To address this, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model. Examining over 23, 000 cells, we created a comprehensive single-cell atlas that captures the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds. Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faecalis infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes. Additionally, E. faecalis infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in our scRNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways, while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faecalis in wound infections. Infections pose a challenge to the wound healing process, affecting both the skin’s protective barrier and the efficient repair mechanisms required for tissue integrity. The skin, the largest and most intricate defense system in mammals, exhibits unique cellular heterogeneity and complexity that maintain tissue homeostasis. Within the skin, undifferentiated resident cells are the main modulators of tissue maintenance, albeit terminal differentiation dynamics adapt to the regenerative requirements of the tissue. Several comprehensive studies conducted in mice and humans have highlighted the complexity of the skin . However, these studies have primarily focused on cellular heterogeneity and the transcriptome of intact skin or uninfected wounds, offering limited insights into the dynamics of wound healing following infection. Efficient healing during wound infections involves a sequence of events occurring in three distinct but interconnected stages: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling . These events involve a series of inter- and intracellular molecular interactions mediated by soluble ligands and the innate immune system . The inflammatory phase initiates migration of leukocytes into the wound site to help clear cell debris and establish tissue protection through local inflammation. Initially, neutrophils, responding to pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, extravasate through the endothelium to the site of injury. then, the proliferative stage aims to reduce wound size through contraction and re-establishment of the epithelial barrier. This stage is helped by activated keratinocytes modulated by inflammatory responses, cytokines, and growth factors. In the final stage, tissue remodeling restores the mechanical properties of intact skin through ECM reorganization, degradation, and synthesis . Dysregulation of this intricate process can lead to pathological outcomes characterized by persistent inflammation and excessive ECM production . Enterococcus faecalis is a commensal bacterium in the human gut, and also an opportunistic pathogen responsible for various infections, including surgical site infections and diabetic ulcers . Bacterial wound infections in general, including those associated with E. faecalis, are biofilm-associated, resulting in an antibiotic-tolerant population that may lead to persistent infections . Additionally, E. faecalis has mechanisms to evade and suppress immune clearance by, for example, suppressing the pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype in macrophage and preventing neutrophil extracellular trap formation .

[ABSTRACT] Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants ( senders ) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants ( receivers ), however, the temporal dynamics of this effect remain poorly studied. Using a custom-built, high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( PTR-ToF-MS ) system, we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurs independent of day:night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics. Instead, it is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, by revealing that they can do both in sequence. Plants rely on chemical cues to identify and mount appropriate responses to herbivores . Among these cues are herbivore-induced plant volatiles ( HIPVs ) . When perceived by undamaged plants, HIPVs can enhance plant defenses, and thus increase plant resistance to future herbivory . HIPVs can directly induce plant defenses . HIPVs can also prime plant defenses. In this case, HIPV-exposed plants respond more strongly and/or more rapidly to a secondary stimulus such as herbivore attack . Plant responses to environmental cues depend on temporal patterns. For example, artificial herbivory that mimics spatiotemporal patterns of chewing herbivores induces more a similar response to actual herbivore attack than when spatiotemporal patterns are ignored . The emission of HIPVs also follows discrete temporal dynamics , which, again, is likely to influence defense responses in receiver plants. Green leaf volatiles ( GLVs ), including ( Z ) -3-hexenyl acetate ( HAC ), ( Z ) -3-hexenal, and ( Z ) -3-hexen-1-ol, are catabolic products of the lipoxygenase/hydroperoxide lyase pathway and are emitted within minutes following damage . Indole and terpenes are emitted within hours of herbivore attack . Indole can mediate interactions between plants as well as between plants and other organisms . Terpenes are a very diverse group of volatiles ( >80, 000 known structures ) that are also important as both direct and indirect plant defenses . Indole and terpenes take longer to produce in comparison to GLVs and are less transiently emitted . In maize, GLVs have been implicated in direct induction , and both GLVs and indole are known to prime defenses, and are thus considered as ‘bioactive’ in information transfer between plants . Although it is clear that plants can either be primed or directly induced following HIPV exposure, if and how these two phenomena integrate in the context of a natural HIPV exposure sequence is unclear. Studies have yet to monitor induction and priming dynamics in real time and during continuous exposure to HIPVs.

[ABSTRACT] Recursive procedures that allow placing a vocal signal inside another of a similar kind provide a neuro-computational blueprint for syntax and phonology in spoken language and human song. There are, however, no known vocal sequences among nonhuman primates arranged in self-embedded patterns that evince vocal recursion or potential incipient or evolutionary transitional forms thereof, suggesting a neuro-cognitive transformation exclusive to humans. Here, we uncover that wild flanged male orangutan long calls feature rhythmically isochronous call sequences nested within isochronous call sequences, consistent with two hierarchical strata. Remarkably, three temporally and acoustically distinct call rhythms in the lower stratum were not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples, which suggests that these recursive structures were neither the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures nor anatomical artifacts of bodily constraints or resonances. Findings represent a case of temporally recursive hominid vocal combinatorics in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music. Second-order combinatorics, ‘sequences within sequences’, involving hierarchically organized and cyclically structured vocal sounds in ancient hominids may have preluded the evolution of recursion in modern language-able humans. A new, direct approach to recursive vocal combinatorics in wild primates is desirable to help infer signal patterns that were recursive in some degree or kind in an extinct past, and molded then into the recursive structures observed today in humans. By virtue of their own primitive nature, proto-recursive structures did not likely fall within modern-day classifications. Therefore, they will often fail to be predicted based on assumptions guided by modern language . To this end, a structural approach is particularly advantageous based on the cross-disciplinary definition of recursion as ‘the nesting of an element or pattern within a self-similar element or pattern’. First, no prior assumptions are required about species’ cognitive capacities. High-level neuro-motor procedures are inferred only to the extent that these are directly reflected in how signal sequences are organized. For example, Chomsky’s definition of recursion can generate non-self-embedded signal structures, but these would be for that same reason operationally undetectable amongst other signal combinations. Second, no prior assumptions are required about signal meaning. There are no certain parallels between semantic content and word meaning in animals, but analyses of signal patterning allow us to identify the similarities between non-semantic ( nonhuman ) and semantic ( human ) combinatoric systems . The search for recursion can, hence, be made in the absence of lexical items, semantics, or syntax. Third, no prior assumptions are required about signal function. Under any evolutionary scenario, including punctuated hypotheses, ancestral signal function ( whether cooperative, competitive, or otherwise ) is expected to have derived or been leveraged by its proto-recursive structure. Otherwise, once present, recursion would not have been fixated among human ancestral populations. Accordingly, a structural approach opens the field to potentially untapped signal diversity in nature and yet unrecognized bona fide combinatoric possibilities within the human clade. Here, we undertake an explorative but direct structural approach to recursion. We provide evidence for recursive self-embedded vocal patterning in a ( nonhuman ) great ape, namely, in the long calls of flanged orangutan males in the wild. We conducted precise rhythm analyses of 66 long call audio recordings produced by 10 orangutans ( Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii ) across approximately 2510 observation hours at Tuanan, Central Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo.

[ABSTRACT] The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life’s evolution. During this process, the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish, Miichthys miiuy. Firstly, the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation response ( HDGCR ) being the main pathway. Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of M. miiuy and Gallus gallus, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can use the m6A methylation process to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. In summary, our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system. The pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( PAMP ) motifs, including proteins, lipids and nucleotides, resulting in activation of innate immune responses of host . Retinoic-acid-induced RIG-I-like receptors ( RLRs ) are a specific group of PRRs belonging to the family of DExD/H-box RNA helicases, and they play a crucial role in the innate antiviral response. There are three members in the RLR family: retinoic-acid-inducible gene I ( RIG-I ), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 ( MDA5 ), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 ( LGP2 ). RIG-I and MDA5 exhibit similar signaling characteristics and structural homology, including two N-terminal caspase-recruitment domains ( CARDs ), a DExD/H box RNA helicase domain, and a C-terminal repressor doma in ( RD ) . However, LGP2 lacks CARD domain . The specific roles of RIG-I and MDA5 in response to virus stimulation are not redundant: RIG-I detects short blunt-end RNA with a 5'-triphosphate motif ( 5’ppp-RNA ), while MDA5 specifically recognizes long forms of viral dsRNA . In contrast, the involvement of LGP2 in cytosolic RNA sensing remains a topic of debate. Some studies have proposed that LGP2 is crucial for the production of type I interferon ( IFN-I ) in response to several RIG-I- and MDA5-dependent viruses , whereas others have described LGP2 as a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling . However, surprisingly, despite the important immune functions of RLR members, they have been lost from the genome in many species including mammals, birds, and fish . 5’ppp-RNA is present in a wide variety of RNA viruses, including Flaviviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae families . These viruses widely infect all kinds of life and cause various harmfulness and serious diseases, and the infected hosts range from the highest vertebrates to the lowest vertebrate, teleost fish . 5’ppp-RNA viruses are expected to be recognized and trigger an antiviral immune response by RIG-I.

[ABSTRACT] Among its extragonadal effects, follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) has an impact on body composition and bone metabolism. Since androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) has a profound impact on circulating FSH concentrations, this hormone could potentially be implicated in the changes of fat body mass ( FBM ), lean body mass ( LBM ), and bone fragility induced by ADT. The objective of this study is to correlate FSH serum levels with body composition parameters, bone mineral density ( BMD ), and bone turnover markers at baseline conditions and after 12 months of ADT. Twenty-nine consecutive non-metastatic prostate cancer ( PC ) patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2019 in a phase IV study. All patients underwent administration of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degarelix. FBM, LBM, and BMD were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 12 months of ADT. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. For outcome measurements and statistical analysis, t-test or sign test and Pearson or Spearman tests for continuous variables were used when indicated. At baseline conditions, a weak, non-significant, direct relationship was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms ( r = 0. 36 ) and legs ( r = 0. 33 ). Conversely, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FBM ( r = 0. 52, p = 0. 006 ), fat mass at arms ( r = 0. 54, p = 0. 004 ), and fat mass at trunk ( r = 0. 45, p = 0. 018 ) assessed after 12 months. On the other hand, an inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio was observed ( r = −0. 64, p = 0. 001 ). This is an ancillary study of a prospective trial and this is the main limitation. FSH serum levels after ADT could have an impact on body composition, in particular on FBM. Therefore, FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and to guide the clinicians in the tailored evaluation of body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT.

Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown that follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) exerts effects beyond those on gonadal tissue, which have been known for a long time . In the animal model, FSH has been observed to stimulate osteoclastic activity and therefore to exert a negative role on bone mass . Furthermore, FSH was found to have a positive action on adipocytes and the blockade of FSH induced by antibodies against FSH receptor caused an increase in bone mass and a reduction of body fat . These preclinical data were confirmed in clinical studies. Large epidemiologic data have shown significant reductions in bone mineral density ( BMD ) and high resorption rates 2–3 years prior to menopause, when FSH serum levels are increasing, which is also associated with increased body weight and visceral adiposity .

[ABSTRACT] Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation ( VT/VF ) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels, none have proven sufficiently effective for preventing SCD. Sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 ( RyR2 ) Ca2+ release channels, the downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) -mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s in the pathophysiology of SCD. We tested the idea that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function. We used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic HF, such as a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene ( DS ) or placebo in early or chronic HF. We assessed the incidence of VT/VF and SCD ( primary outcome ), ECG heart rate and QT variability, echocardiographic left ventricular ( LV ) structure and function, immunohistochemical LV fibrosis, and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation. DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function. Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function. These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD. SCD in heart failure ( HF ) is the leading cause of death in the modern world. Current therapies for preventing SCD due to VT/VF are limited. For example, ICDs, the only effective therapy for VT/VF and SCD, are palliative, expensive, and pose several risks. Moreover, many patients suffer from VT/VF and SCD in the early stages of HF before they become eligible to receive an ICD . Antiarrhythmic drugs, which target ion channels, may confer acute benefits but can also be proarrhythmic, triggering VT/VF. Importantly, most antiarrhythmic drugs worsen survival over the longer term . Thus, there is a pressing need to identify new antiarrhythmic targets and develop new therapies for SCD. A growing body of evidence indicates that sympathetic stress-induced hyperactivity of the RyR2, located in the SR of cardiac myocytes, causes SR Ca2+ leak, which contributes to the pathogenesis of VT/VF and SCD . During systole, the release of Ca2+ by the RyR2 plays a pivotal role in myocyte excitation-contraction coupling. The degree of contractility is determined by the amount of Ca2+ in the SR and by the timing and magnitude of Ca2+ release. In diseased and/or stressed hearts, PKA-mediated hyper-phosphorylation and ROS-mediated oxidation results in a leaky RyR2 , which allows Ca2+ to leak out of SR during diastole. The consequent reduction in SR Ca2+ load weakens systolic contraction. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ levels also leads to DADs, which can trigger atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias . Recent evidence suggests that dantrolene, a RyR2 inhibitor, reduces the inducibility of atrial fibrillation in animals with myocardial infarction .

[ABSTRACT] Smads and their transcription factor partners mediate the transcriptional responses of target cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) family, including those of the conserved bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) family, yet only a small number of direct target genes have been well characterized. In C. elegans, the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates multiple biological functions, including body size, via a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade. Here, we identify functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri based on ChIP-seq peaks ( identified by modEncode ) and expression differences of nearby genes identified from RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants. We found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes. At a genome-wide scale, SMA-3/Smad acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas SMA-9/Schnurri direct targets include both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppress the small body size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnurri function. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a new role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase dpy-11. Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that in turn regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation. Members of the TGF-β family of secreted ligands play numerous roles in development and disease. In humans, there are 33 ligand genes that can be broadly separated into two subfamilies: the TGF-β/Activin subfamily and the BMP subfamily . Due to the conservation of these ligands and their signaling pathways across metazoans, genetic studies in invertebrate systems have been instrumental in identifying signaling mechanisms . Canonical signaling occurs when ligand dimers bind to transmembrane receptors generating a heterotetrameric complex consisting of two type I and two type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. Following ligand binding and complex assembly, the constitutively active type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor on the GS domain and thereby activates its kinase domain . The activated type I receptor phosphorylates the C-terminus of intracellular receptor-regulated Smads ( R-Smads ), promoting their heterotrimeric complex formation with co-Smads. The heterotrimeric Smad complex accumulates in the nucleus and binds DNA directly to elicit changes in gene expression . Co-Smads for all ligands and R-Smads for TGF-β/Activin ligands bind a 4 bp GTCT Smad Binding Element ( SBE ); furthermore, R-Smads for BMP ligands associate with GC-rich sequences ( GC-SBE ) . The SBE is considered too degenerate and low affinity to account fully for binding specificity, so transcription factor partners likely contribute to target gene selection . To date, only a few direct target genes of Smads have been extensively studied, including Drosophila brinker ; Xenopus mixer and Xvent2 ; and the mammalian ATF3 and Id genes . Genome-wide studies have the potential to expand these examples and explained general principles of target gene selection . More of these studies are needed to understand how Smad transcriptional partners influence target gene selection and contribute to the execution of specific biological functions. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a BMP signaling cascade initiated by the ligand DBL-1 plays a major role in body size regulation .

[ABSTRACT] Cancer immune evasion contributes to checkpoint immunotherapy failure in many patients with metastatic cancers. The embryonic transcription factor DUX4 was recently characterized as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation that is aberrantly expressed in a small subset of primary tumors. Here, we report that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with ~10–50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX4. DUX4 expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients. DUX4 expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort, with DUX4 expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year. Our data motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance. Immune checkpoint inhibition ( ICI ) therapy utilizes immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies to stimulate patient anti-tumor immune responses. Blockade of T cell co-inhibitory receptors, such as CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, has achieved major success in the treatment of diverse metastatic cancers compared to first-line chemotherapy . However, a majority of advanced cancer patients fail to respond to ICI due to de novo or acquired resistance, the mechanistic bases of which remain incompletely understood. Diverse mechanisms modulate sensitivity and resistance to ICI . These mechanisms include defects in Major Histocompatibility Complex ( MHC ) class I-mediated antigen presentation due to loss of B2M or HLA , PTEN and LSD1 inactivation, which sensitizes tumor cells to type I interferon signaling , T cell dysfunction , presence of specific T cell populations in the tumor microenvironment , and active WNT–β-catenin signaling . Mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling in BRAF-mutated melanomas and CDK4/CDK6 activity have also been implicated in reduced ICI efficacy, and combination treatment with an MAPK/CDK inhibitor improves response to checkpoint blockade . Tumor cell-intrinsic interferon-gamma ( IFN-γ ) signaling is particularly important in anti-tumor immunity. This pathway induces expression of genes involved in MHC class I-mediated antigen processing and presentation, which include genes encoding the TAP1/TAP2 transporters, components of the immunoproteasome, HLA proteins, and B2M . Thus, suppression of IFN-γ activity promotes tumor immune evasion and decreased CD8+ T cell activation. Indeed, decreased ICI efficacy was observed in patients with tumors harboring inactivating mutations in IFN-γ pathway genes such as JAK1 and JAK2 . Similarly, a recent study reported a splicing-augmenting mutation in JAK3, linked to decreased JAK3 expression levels, as a potential process of resistance in a patient with metastatic melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy . Some cancers exhibit aberrant expression of embryonic DUX transcription factors. For instance, DUXB is expressed in diverse primary malignancies, most notably in testicular germ cell and breast carcinomas . Recent work from our group and others showed that DUX4 is expressed in a small subset of primary tumors, where it suppresses tumor cell antigen presentation and response to IFN-γ signaling . We additionally observed signals that DUX4 expression was associated with reduced survival following response to anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 in melanoma; however, those analyses relied upon two small cohorts ( n = 27 or 41 patients ), limiting the statistical power of our conclusions. In its native embryonic context, DUX4 initializes human zygotic genome activation.

[ABSTRACT] Lack of data on the aetiology of livestock diseases constrains effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security and public health. Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome affecting productivity and public health. Several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa surveillance data rarely include information from abortions, little is known about aetiology and impacts, and data are not available to inform interventions. This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform established in Tanzania spanning pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder systems to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers ( LFO ) and on to investigation teams. Events were included if the research team or LFO could attend within 72 hr. If so, samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate ( a ) determinants of attribution; ( b ) patterns of events, including species and breed, previous abortion history, and seasonality; ( c ) determinants of reporting, investigation and attribution; ( d ) cases involving zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017–2019, 215 events in cattle ( n=71 ), sheep ( n=44 ), and goats ( n=100 ) were investigated. Attribution, achieved for 19. 5% of cases, was significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. Livestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale, can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. This study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system, achieved through engagement of community-based field officers, establishment of practical sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic platforms. Livestock reproductive losses, including spontaneous abortion, are a major concern for the livestock industry worldwide, resulting in significant economic loss and posing a threat to public health . The impacts of livestock abortion on the world’s poorest livestock-keepers, who are heavily dependent on livestock for food security and livelihoods , is likely to be substantial. For these families, the loss of a livestock foetus and a subsequent decline in milk production reduces the availability of a high-quality food source ( milk ) that can be essential for childhood growth and cognitive development . In addition, livestock reproductive losses reduce income ( from sales of meat and milk ), and cause a loss of livestock assets that are a critical source of wealth, collateral or a safety net in times of need . Recent analyses have shown that because of the need for increased spending on animal management, livestock abortions mayalso have indirect negative impacts on household expenditure and education . Livestock abortion can also pose a direct threat to human health because many abortigenic agents are also zoonotic . Surveillance is defined as the real-time ( or near real-time ) collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of health-related data to enable the early identification of the impact ( or absence of impact ) of potential health threats, which require effective action . Effective livestock health surveillance provides critical data for evidence-based approaches to livestock disease control and management but this requires reliable, high-quality, and timely data that can be drawn from multiple sources .

[ABSTRACT] Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine ( NIC ) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the process underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif ( TAZ ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAchR ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. Hence, this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors. All tissues and organs are generated from stem cells. Abnormal stem cell functions are significantly associated with age-related organ dysfunction and carcinogenesis . Intestinal epithelial turnover is sustained by intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) and adjacent Paneth cells. Paneth cells constitute the niche for ISCs that reside at the bottom of the crypts. Most of the ISCs are leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 ( Lgr5 ) +ones that regulate intestinal homeostasis in response to dietary signals . In the intestine, Lgr5 +ISCs are possibly the origin of precancerous adenomas . For instance, long-term high-fat diet ( HFD ) -induced obesity enhances the self-renewal potential of ISC and promotes in vivo formation of tumors via the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta in ISCs . Moreover, cigarette smoking has emerged as a potential major risk factor associated with colon cancer, along with metabolic risk factors such as diet and obesity. Previous studies indicate that cigarette smoking is significantly associated with colon cancer and mortality in humans and animal models . Cigarette smoke contains a wide range of compounds that are harmful to human health; nicotine ( NIC ) derivatives 4- ( methylnitrosamino ) –1- ( 3-pyridyl ) –1-butanone ( NNK ) and N'-nitrosonornicotine ( NNN ) are highly carcinogenic , which can induce mutations in tumor suppressive genes like Rasa, Trp53, and Rb . Although NIC itself, the addictive component in cigarette smoke, is generally considered to have a limited ability to initiate cancer, it can stimulate several effects crucial for cancer development independently . However, knowledge of the process underlying the NIC-regulated ISC functions and intestinal tumorigenicity is limited. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the effects of NIC treatment on the functions of murine ISCs ex vivo and in vivo. Moreover, we explored the molecular factors and signaling cascades prospectively associated with the regulation of the effects of NIC on ISCs. This study can potentially contribute to the comprehensive knowledge on the pathway by which stem cells respond to NIC, a major component of cigarette smoke, and suggest an effective new strategy for the treatment of smoking-related colon cancer.

[ABSTRACT] Hsp70 is a key cellular system counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, associated with stress, ageing, and disease. Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins ( JDPs ) and nucleotide exchange factors ( NEFs ). Here, we explained the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation, determining its final efficacy. The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surface, which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones. Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction. Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation, but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. Thus, balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential. During stress, protein homeostasis is perturbed by protein misfolding and aggregation. Accumulation of protein aggregates disrupts cellular functions and contributes to ageing and is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases . A protein quality control system, relying on a network of cooperating chaperones, has evolved to moderate stress-induced proteotoxicity and rebalance proteostasis. To refold proteins from aggregates into their native state, eukaryotes use a system comprising Hsp70, an ATP-dependent chaperone, and its co-chaperones: an Hsp110 nucleotide exchange factor ( NEF ) and a J-domain protein ( JDP/Hsp40 ), together with an Hsp100 disaggregase . The process is initiated by a JDP, which delivers Hsp70 to an aggregated substrate and whose J-domain induces ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70, resulting in conformational changes that stabilise the interaction with aggregates . Next, Hsp100 interacts with the Hsp70-aggregate complex and the aggregate-trapped polypeptides are translocated through the Hsp100 hexamer. The disentangled and released polypeptides can fold back into their native conformation, alone or with further aid of chaperones . Hsp110 co-chaperone boosts the Hsp70 activity by stimulating nucleotide exchange and substrate release . It belongs to the Hsp70 superfamily, with identical domain organisation to Hsp70 but distinct size and arrangement of the nucleotide-binding domain ( NBD ) and substrate-binding domain ( SBD ) . In contrast to Hsp70, Hsp110 is unable to refold denatured proteins, yet it may bind to and prevent aggregation of certain misfolding substrates . In its well-established NEF function, the NBD of Hsp110 interacts with the ADP form of Hsp70, which mediates the release of the nucleotide. Subsequent ATP binding to the NBD of Hsp70 prompts the opening of the SBD and substrate dissociation, resetting Hsp70 for another round of the cycle . In vivo studies on yeast chaperones demonstrated that the Hsp110 co-chaperone Sse1 plays a key role in Hsp70 recruitment to aggregates and is essential for protein disaggregation . Hsp110 is a major cytoplasmic NEF of Hsp70 and the deletion of its both paralogs, SSE1 and SSE2, is lethal and the growth can only be supported, albeit with less efficacy, by overexpression of FES1, another cytoplasmic NEF from an unrelated armadillo family . The importance of Hsp110 is also manifested in vitro in the low disaggregation activity of the yeast Hsp70 system without Hsp110 and the complete interdependence between their human orthologs .

[ABSTRACT] Gait is impaired in musculoskeletal conditions, such as knee arthropathy. Gait analysis is used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and monitor disease progression or intervention response. However, clinical gait analysis relies on subjective visual observation of walking as objective gait analysis has not been possible within clinical settings due to the expensive equipment, large-scale facilities, and highly trained staff required. Relatively low-cost wearable digital insoles may offer a solution to these challenges. In this work, we demonstrate how a digital insole measuring osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures yields similar results to the clinical gait-lab standard. To achieve this, we constructed a machine learning model, trained on force plate data collected in participants with knee arthropathy and controls. This model was highly predictive of force plate data from a validation set ( area under the receiver operating characteristics curve = 0. 86; area under the precision-recall curve = 0. 90 ) and of a separate, independent digital insole dataset containing control and knee osteoarthritis subjects ( auROC = 0. 83; auPR = 0. 86 ). After showing that digital insole-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional gait measurements, we next showed that a single stride of raw sensor time-series data could be accurately assigned to each subject, highlighting that individuals using digital insoles can be identified by their gait characteristics. This work provides a framework for a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods, adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding wearable technology analytical pipelines, and supports clinical development of at-home gait assessments, with the potential to improve the ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring. Gait assessment plays several roles in clinical practice and research for many musculoskeletal and orthopedic diseases, such as diagnosis, guiding treatment selection, and measuring intervention response. . Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) contributes to altered gait as individuals try to avoid knee pain and cartilage contact stress ( i. e., weight shift or joint loading onto the non-affected limb ) . Those with knee OA commonly have increased lateral trunk lean toward the ipsilateral limb, along with non-significantly increased trunk/pelvic flexion and resultant significant alterations in external hip adduction moments . Clinically, gait is examined in knee OA through clinical visual observation of walking, which is subjective and dependent on expertise. Beyond visual observation, gait has been traditionally objectively assessed in specialized gait laboratories with expensive equipment, such as force platforms, with or without a motion-tracking system. However, gait laboratories are generally not available or feasible within clinical settings due to cost, need for highly trained staff to operate equipment, and the size of equipment. Wearable sensors offer an alternative approach to assessment of gait in those with knee OA as they can be deployed within any environment or setting , are relatively low-cost, and can provide outcomes automatically without the need for highly experienced or trained staff. Vertical ground reaction force ( vGRF ) is a gait characteristic that is impaired within knee OA as it relates to the bilateral weightbearing capabilities of the patient ( i. e., greater peak vGRF ) . Traditionally, vGRF is objectively examined using force plates, which can provide three components of force ( vertical, anterior-posterior, and medio-lateral ) . Force plate signals can provide information on gait characteristics, postural stability, as well as direction, strength, and duration of stance phase .

[ABSTRACT] Pain after surgery causes significant suffering. Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain. Local application of Clarix Flo ( FLO ), a human amniotic membrane ( AM ) product, attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice. This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We further purified the major matrix component, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3. Surgery or trauma may lead to persistent pain, impeding functional recovery and causing considerable distress . Continuous reliance on opioid analgesics causes severe side effects and accidental death, which resulted in a national public health emergency being declared in 2017 . Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid alternative therapies for managing post-surgical/post-operative pain. An optimal strategy would be to develop local treatments that both inhibit pain and address the underlying pathophysiology, such as neuronal sensitization while avoiding the central side effects of commonly used analgesics . A naturally occurring biologic derived from human birth tissues has recently gained our attention as a potential solution for this challenging problem. The birth tissue is predominantly comprised of the amniotic membrane ( AM ) and umbilical cord ( UC ), which share the same cell origin as the fetus. These versatile biological tissues have been used as medical therapy in a wide range of conditions . FLO ( Clarix Flo; BioTissue, Miami, FL ) is a sterile, micronized, and lyophilized form of human AM/UC matrix used for surgical and non-surgical repair, reconstruction, or replacement of soft tissue by filling in the connective tissue void. They have been shown to orchestrate regenerative healing within its anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring properties in ophthalmic applications . Intriguingly, FLO also appears to relieve pain effectively in several ocular surface disorders , and musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis and lower extremity neuropathy . However, the mechanisms underlying its potential pain-inhibitory properties and how it may affect sensory neuron excitability remain unknown. In a plantar-incision mouse model of post-surgical pain, we first explored whether FLO may be deployed as a viable biologic for the treatment of trauma pain. We then purified the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ), which is in uniquely high amounts in human AM. The natural process of HC-HA/PTX3 formation may involve: Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 protein covalently binds to HC1 of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor and then transfers it to high-molecular-weight hyaluronan ( HMW-HA ). At this point, HC1 becomes conjugated, and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 is released. PTX3 then tightly associates with the HC1–HA complex by binding to the HC1. HC-HA/PTX3 was recently shown to alleviate dry eye disease induced by chronic graft-versus-host disease by suppressing inflammation and scarring in murine lacrimal glands .

[ABSTRACT] Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells show heterogeneous levels of pigmentation when cultured in vitro. To know whether their color in appearance is correlated with the function of the RPE, we analyzed the color intensities of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells ( iPSC-RPE ) together with the gene expression profile at the single-cell level. For this purpose, we utilized our recent invention, Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System ( ALPS ), which enabled photographing each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell. While our iPSC-RPE were categorized into four clusters by gene expression, the color intensity of iPSC-RPE did not project any specific gene expression profiles. We reasoned this by less correlation between the actual color and the gene expressions that directly define the level of pigmentation, from which we hypothesized the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition not strongly indicating the functional characteristics of the RPE. RPE is a layer of cells paved by hexagonal, brown-pigmented cells, which locates between the neural retina and the choroid. RPE cells play an important role in maintaining the visual system by supplying nutrition to the photoreceptors, phagocytosing mature outer segments of the photoreceptors, facilitating visual/retinoid cycle to produce a photosensitive derivative of vitamin A, absorbing stray light for the vision, and secreting vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) for the maintenance of choroid blood vessels . Abnormalities in the RPE cause a wide variety of retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) which is a devastating disease leading to blindness. Medication for AMD is limited, and there are increasing attention on cell transplantation of RPE for the treatment. RPE transplantation for AMD to replace degenerated RPE with fetal RPE was introduced almost three decades ago . Later, transplantation of autologous peripheral RPE to the degenerated site has also been reported . Our laboratory has pioneered in the production of RPE cells from iPSC and ocular transplantation of iPSC-derived RPE cells ( iPSC-RPE ) to replace degenerated RPE of AMD patients . For quality management of iPSC-RPE transplants, we routinely verify the expressions of key factors such as RPE65, Bestrophin, CRALBP, and MERTK by quantitative PCR; PAX6 and microphthalmia transcription factor ( MiTF ) by immunostaining; and pigment epithelium-derived factor glycoprotein ( PEDF ) and VEGF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ). The morphology and pigmentation are also qualitatively checked, but there has been no means to link these appearances with gene expression. Our recent invention, ALPS, enables the characterization of a cell that is actually showing a behavior of interest . While monitoring the cells in live, ALPS enables to pick up one single-cell for further manipulation. In the present study, we utilized this system to monitor the color of iPSC-RPE cells, then to pick up one of the cells, followed by RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of that single-cell. In this way, we concluded the color of iPSC-RPE cells did not project any specific gene expression profile. We reasoned this by analyzing the correlation between the color and the expression level of each gene. We found the genes that define pigmentation itself had less correlation with the color, suggesting the color in appearance is a temporal condition that does not directly represent the function of the RPE.

[ABSTRACT] In recent years, the field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ), due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans, has emerged as a pivotal model toward this effort. However, traditional research methodologies often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this critical gap, we developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling ( MarmoAAP ), a new behavioral apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets. MarmoAAP addresses the limitations of traditional behavioral research methods by enabling high-throughput, detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting. We also highlight the flexibility of MarmoAAP in task parameter manipulation which accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual animal capabilities. Furthermore, MarmoAAP provides a platform to perform investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors. MarmoAAP is a versatile and strong tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes. This new apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations, paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism. The study of animal behavior is essential for comprehending the intricacies of behavioral dynamics and their underlying cognitive processes. Exploring the neurobiological foundations of animal behavior enables the identification of shared neural mechanisms governing decision-making, learning, memory, and problem-solving throughout the broader spectrum of the animal kingdom. However, investigations of the neurobiology of ecologically valid behaviors can be extremely challenging using traditional approaches. With the rapid advancements in methods for recording and manipulating neural activity from these species, there arises a critical need to modernize our approaches to studying animal behavior to ensure they keep pace with the evolving neural techniques . There is growing recognition of the common marmoset’s ( Callithrix jacchus ) potential as an invaluable animal model in neuroscience research as evidenced by efforts to create marmoset brain databases at multiple biological levels . Marmosets provide notable advantages as research models, including their immediate relevance to humans given their genetic relatedness and shared dominant sensory modalities , and their small size which facilitates naturalistic, freely moving studies of primate social behaviors that can be challenging with larger species like macaques. Further, they offer a distinctive platform for the study of social behaviors due to their significant parallels with human social structures. Marmosets are particularly prosocial and socially tolerant primates that, like humans, engage in pair bonding and cooperative breeding , which has been theorized to have significantly shaped socio-cognitive abilities. Indeed, marmosets consistently show more socio-cognitively advanced behaviors such as social learning, vocal communication, understanding and use of gaze cues, and cooperative problem-solving relative to non-cooperatively breeding primates . As primates, marmosets also share significant similarities to humans in their neural circuits involved in social cognition . For example, both humans and marmosets show similar face-responsive brain regions in the temporal lobe and similar brain networks comprising the social brain . Marmosets provide a unique opportunity to investigate social behavioral dynamics, however, being a relatively new model in the field of neuroscience, they have yet to benefit from the extensive methodological developments available for other model organisms like rodents.

[ABSTRACT] Alcohol consumption in pregnancy can affect genome regulation in the developing offspring but results have been contradictory. We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE ) resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans. Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In our murine model, a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation. Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions. Alcohol consumption in pregnancy is a leading cause of neurodevelopmental impairments in children . Alcohol can pass through the placenta acting as a teratogen in fetal tissues causing physical, cognitive, behavioural, and neurodevelopmental impairment in children at high doses with lifelong consequences for health . Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder ( FASD ) and fetal alcohol syndrome ( FAS ) can arise at binge levels of exposure, although not always at lower levels of exposure. Whether prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE ) is sufficient to induce overt physiological abnormalities depends on multiple environmental and genetic factors including the dose and timing of alcohol use during pregnancy, maternal diet, smoking, stress, and potentially other factors that collectively influence fetal outcomes . Patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy vary, but epidemiological surveys suggest most women in Western countries consume low to moderate levels between conception until recognition of pregnancy , after which time consumption largely ceases, apart from occasional use . While the effects of binge levels of exposure are well documented as able to cause FASD, more subtle effects that reflect the more common patterns of drinking are unclear and more research is needed to support public health initiatives to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Studies suggest alcohol can disrupt fetal gene regulation through epigenetic mechanisms . DNA methylation is one epigenetic process involving the catalytic addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases within cytosine-guanine ( CpG ) dinucleotide motifs during one-carbon metabolism. Methylation of DNA can alter chromatin density and influence patterns of gene expression in a tissue-specific and developmentally appropriate manner and disruption to this process may cause some of the difficulties experienced by people with FASD . Previous studies on human participants and animals report that alcohol can disrupt DNA methylation either globally or at specific gene regions . Our recent systematic review, however, found limited replication of effects between studies suggesting the effects of alcohol on DNA methylation may be stochastic and influenced by numerous confounding factors . PAE can either directly inhibit DNA methyltransferase enzymes or disrupt one-carbon metabolism via inhibition of bioavailability of dietary methyl donors, such as folate and choline to the fetus .

[ABSTRACT] Since double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) is effective for silencing a wide variety of genes, all genes are typically considered equivalent targets for such RNA interference ( RNAi ). Yet, loss of some regulators of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can selectively impair the silencing of some genes. Here, we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. In this network, the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene, where only the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. Quantitative models and their exploratory simulations led us to find that ( 1 ) changing cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3, ( 2 ) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and ( 3 ) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within ‘pUG zones’ matching the dsRNA. Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs. Double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) can trigger the conserved process of RNA interference ( RNAi ) to degrade mRNA of matching sequence , and thus silence gene expression, in many organisms. This conservation has made dsRNA-based drugs useful in crops , insects , and humans . While a dsRNA-based drug can be designed using just the mRNA sequence of any target gene, the intracellular effectiveness of the drug and the ease with which an organism could escape the drug by developing resistance are difficult to predict. Predicting both efficacy and susceptibility to resistance for each target could inform the selection of a suitable target from two or more equivalent candidates. Extensive characterization of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans makes it a suitable system to examine how differences between target genes and reliance on specific regulators contribute to efficacy and resistance. A skeletal pathway that is required for gene silencing in response to the addition of dsRNA has been worked out in C. elegans ( Figure 1A ). Long dsRNA is imported through the transmembrane protein SID-1 , after which it is bound by the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 , which recruits the endonuclease DCR-1 to cleave the long dsRNA into smaller dsRNAs . The primary Argonaute protein RDE-1 cleaves one strand of the smaller dsRNA and associates with the other, making it a 1° short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) that can guide the recognition of target mRNAs of complementary sequence ( siRNAs; processing, pink ). After recognition by RDE-1-bound siRNAs, the target mRNAs are cleaved and the 5′ fragments are stabilized through the addition of 3′ UG-dinucleotide repeats by the nucleotidyltransferase RDE-3 to form pUG RNAs , which act as templates for the amplification of 2° siRNAs by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. This amplification of silencing signals through the production of 2° siRNAs is helped by the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16 , the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10 , and their interactors .

[ABSTRACT] Mortality and morbidity from tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) are common, primarily due to inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality, and determine the best predictors of death, utilizing whole-blood RNA sequencing from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 pulmonary tuberculosis ( PTB ), and 30 healthy controls. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, with a consensus analysis revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. We employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death, then logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose best predictors. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization. Four hub genes—MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4—were strong TBM mortality predictors. These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death, offering insights for potential therapeutic targets alongside a new four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes. Of 7. 1 million new tuberculosis ( TB ) cases in 2019, tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) is estimated to have developed in 164, 000 adults, around 25% of whom were living with HIV . TBM is the most severe form of TB, causing death or neurological disability in half of all cases. Overall, TBM mortality is around 25%, but rises to around 50% in those with HIV, with most deaths occurring in the first 3 months of treatment . The poor outcomes from TBM are strongly associated with the inflammatory response , with both a paucity and an excess of inflammation linked to death from TBM . However, the mechanisms behind these observations remain uncertain. Immune responses in TBM are thought to be compartmentalized within the central nervous system. Studies have shown that immune cell counts, cytokine concentrations, metabolites and transcriptional responses differ between the peripheral blood and the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . In adults with TBM, leukocyte activation is higher in the CSF than in peripheral blood, although a marked myeloid response in peripheral blood has been reported . Blood transcriptomic analysis has found increased neutrophil-associated transcripts and inflammasome signaling in those with HIV-associated TBM and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome . In children with TBM, whole blood transcriptional profiles showed increased inflammasome activation and decreased T-cell activation . Taken together, these studies suggest the inflammatory response associated with TBM may have a greater systemic component than originally thought and its characterization may help define the immune mechanisms leading to death and disability. The accurate and early detection of patients at highest risk of complications and death from TBM may help to target treatment for those most in need. The British Medical Research Council ( MRC ) grades have been used to categorize TBM severity for almost 80 years , and the system strongly predicts TBM mortality . Previously, we and others developed new prognostic models from studies of 1699 adults with TBM using clinical and laboratory parameters, including MRC grade . These models predicted outcomes more accurately than MRC grade alone. However, they might be improved by measures of host inflammatory response.

[ABSTRACT] Antibodies are critical reagents to detect and characterize proteins. It is commonly understood that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets, but information on the scope of the problem remains largely anecdotal, and as such, feasibility of the goal of at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in a proteome cannot be assessed. Focusing on antibodies for human proteins, we have scaled a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins. Side-by-side comparisons of all antibodies against each target, obtained from multiple commercial partners, have demonstrated that: ( i ) more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more applications, ( ii ) yet, ~50–75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, depending on application, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant; and ( iii ) recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles, which should raise alarm. Encouragingly, more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers, and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market. This first study helps demonstrate the scale of the antibody specificity problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome; mine the existing commercial antibody repertoire, and use the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts. Antibodies are critical reagents used in a range of applications, enabling the identification, quantification, and localization of proteins studied in biomedical and clinical research. The research enterprise spends significantly on the ~1. 6 M commercially available antibodies targeting ~96% of human proteins . Unfortunately, a significant percentage of these antibodies do not recognize the intended protein or recognize the protein but also recognize non-intended targets, with estimates that $0. 375 to $1. 75 billion is wasted yearly on non-specific antibodies . Perhaps worse, the use of poor-quality antibodies is a major factor in the scientific reproducibility crisis . With tens to hundreds of antibodies available for any given protein target, it is difficult for antibody users to select the best performing antibody , and a growing number of cases reveal that depending on previously published antibodies is not a reliable method to assess their performance . Academic and industry scientists aspire to have at least one, and ideally more, potent, selective and renewable antibody for each human protein for each of the most common applications . Unfortunately, there is no agreed-upon process to determine, validate or compare antibody performance and there are multiple strategies for antibody validation , with unequal scientific value. Most information on how commercial antibodies perform is anecdotal. It is thus difficult to assess progress toward the objective of well-validated antibodies for each human protein, or to design a strategy to accomplish this aim. We sought to address this issue by developing optimized protocols to assess antibody specificity in the three most common uses of antibodies in biomedical research laboratories; Western blot ( WB ), immunoprecipitation ( IP ), and immunofluorescence ( IF ). We used these protocols to test antibodies against a variety of neuroscience targets, chosen by funders, to predict requirements for the larger goal of coverage of an entire mammalian proteome.

[ABSTRACT] The ability to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal is emerging as a major need, especially in the context of inter-organ communication studies. This type of study is made possible by technologies combining the GAL4/UAS and a second binary expression system such as the LexA system or QF system. Here, we describe a resource of reagents that helped combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary system in various Drosophila tissues. Focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns, we generated a set of more than 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in and verified their tissue specificity in larvae. We also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector. Following successful integration of this construct into the fly genome, FLP/FRT recombination is used to isolate fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. Finally, using new compatible shRNA vectors, we evaluated both LexA and QF systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a library of such RNAi fly lines as a community resource. Together, these LexA and QF system vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal. Most reagents available for loss-of-function ( LOF ) and gain-of-function studies using RNAi or CRISPR rely on GAL4/UAS-mediated expression . However, some studies, such as the study of intercellular or inter-organ communication, require the simultaneous use of two independent binary transcriptional systems. For example, dual expression systems have been used to study how a Drosophila insulin-like peptide released from the wing primordium communicates with the brain to control organ growth , analyze signaling from olfactory neurons to blood cells , independently manipulate ligand-producing and ligand receiving cells , and visualize interactions between clonal cell populations in tissues . Based on the need to simultaneously manipulate different sets of cells in a given tissue, the LexA/LexAop system and the QF/QUAS system have been developed. There have been no systematic studies comparing the two systems, with only anecdotal evidence to support one system over the other. The numbers of available LexA and QF fly lines with tissue-specific expression domains are far lower than that represented by the thousands of GAL4 enhancer lines, which have been developed using various approaches over the past 25 years. The largest existing set of LexA system driver lines were produced by the Janelia FlyLight Project and Vienna Tiles Project . However, these lines were developed primarily for nervous system expression. Although they are often expressed in other tissues, they are not well suited for experiments targeting non-neuronal cell types. Furthermore, the FlyLight lines use a p65 transcriptional activation domain and therefore are not compatible with the GAL80 temperature-sensitive GAL4 repression system. A second large collection of ~180 LexA-based enhancer trap fly stocks has been generated ( the StanEx collection ) . On average, each StanEx line expresses LexA activity in five distinct cell types, with only one line showing expression in just one tissue, unfortunately limiting usefulness of these reagents . These findings are consistent with prior studies indicating that enhancers very rarely produce expression patterns that are limited to a single cell type in a complex organism .

[ABSTRACT] The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remained unclear. We show in mice that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate C1ql2 to exert its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ). Interruption of C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or by deletion of Nrxn3 in the dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b as well as C1ql2 mutant phenotype. Together, this study identifies a new C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. Thus, our findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction. Disruptions in synaptic structure and function have been identified as a major determinant in the manifestation of various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability . The need to understand how synaptic function is compromised in these disorders has accentuated the importance of studying the regulatory mechanisms of physiological synaptic function. These mechanisms involve cell adhesion molecules at both the pre- and post-synaptic side that act as synaptic organizers, whose unique combination determines the structural and functional properties of the synapse. Many such proteins have already been identified and our understanding of their complex role in synapse assembly and function has significantly increased over the last years . Furthermore, recent advances in the genetics of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders have implicated genes encoding for several of the known synaptic proteins, supporting a role for these molecules in the pathogenesis of corresponding disorders . The sensitivity of the functional specification of the synapse to the combination of distinct synaptic proteins and their relative expression levels suggests that genetically encoded programs define at least facets of the synaptic properties in a cell-type-specific manner . Several of the synaptic proteins have been shown to promote formation of functional pre- and postsynaptic assemblies when presented in non-neuronal cells , showing that their ability to specify synapses is in part independent of signaling processes and neuronal activity and supporting the idea that synaptic function is governed by cues linked to cellular origin . Thus, the investigation of synaptic organizers and their function in health and disease should be expanded to the transcriptional programs that regulate their expression. Bcl11b ( also known as Ctip2 ) is a zinc finger transcription factor that has been implicated in various disorders of the nervous system including Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease, and schizophrenia . Patients with BCL11B mutations present with neurodevelopmental delay, overall learning deficits as well as impaired speech acquisition and autistic features . Bcl11b is expressed in several neuron types, including the dentate gyrus granule neurons ( DGN ) of the hippocampus. Expression of Bcl11b in the DGN starts during embryonic development and persists into adulthood . We have previously demonstrated that Bcl11b plays a crucial role in the development of the hippocampal mossy fiber system, adult hippocampal neurogenesis as well as hippocampal learning and memory .

[ABSTRACT] To function effectively as an integrated system, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries must communicate through mechanisms that are still poorly understood. Here, we focus on the zinc-finger Sfp1, known to regulate transcription of proliferation-related genes. We show that Sfp1 can regulate transcription either by binding to promoters, like most known transcription activators, or by binding to the transcribed regions ( gene bodies ), probably via RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ). We further studied the first mode of Sfp1 activity and found that, following promoter binding, Sfp1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration, manifested by dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking. Surprisingly, Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1’s dissociation from chromatin. Intriguingly, Sfp1 dissociation from the chromatin correlates with the extent of the backtracked Pol II. We propose that, following promoter recruitment, Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking. The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1’s relocation to the nascent transcripts, whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability. Thus, Sfp1’s co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate, serving as a model for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs, and a model for the dual-role of some zinc-finger proteins. The interplay between Sfp1’s two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined. In the last decade, investigators have accumulated evidence for a direct cross-talk between the transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages of gene expression. The dialogue between transcription and mRNA decay has been reported by several investigators, including us . Often, this dialog results in ‘mRNA buffering, ’ which maintains an approximately constant mRNA level despite transient changes in mRNA synthesis or decay rates . In particular, communication pathways have been discovered between promoters and mRNA translation or decay . However, the underlying process remains elusive. During transcription by Pol II, several RNA-binding proteins ( RBPs ) bind to nascent transcripts, thus modulating the transcription cycle . Importantly, in some cases, RBPs remain bound to the mRNA, accompanying it to the cytoplasm and regulating post-transcriptional stages. For example, the Pol II subunits Rpb4 and Rpb7 bind to mRNAs and regulate their translation and decay . We named the latter cases ‘mRNA imprinting, ’ because this binding imprints the mRNA fate . Although Rpb4 is a quintessential imprinted factor, it functions as a general factor that binds to numerous mRNAs . Imprinting by a ‘classical’ transcription factor ( TF ) that binds to specific promoters, thus regulating transcription by modulating the assembly of general transcription factors, including Pol II, is currently unknown. Such imprinting might broaden our understanding of the functions of TFs – not just transcription regulators but regulators of both the nuclear transcription and cytoplasmic post-transcription stages of gene expression. We previously reported a special case of cross-talk between promoter elements and mRNA decay which is mediated by Rap1 binding sites ( RapBSs ) and by Rap1 protein . RapBSs ( 12–14 bp ) are found in ~5% of the promoters, including ~90% of ribosomal protein ( RP ) and a small portion of Ribosome Biogenesis ( RiBi ) promoters . Rap1 is bound to essentially all such RP promoters in vivo and is involved in their transcription activation.

[ABSTRACT] Programmed cell death occurring during plant development ( dPCD ) is a fundamental process integral for plant growth and reproduction. Here, we investigate the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots, focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO ( SMB ) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. Mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. smb-3 mutants additionally exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of S. indica-induced root-growth promotion. This demonstrates that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense process restricting microbial invasion of the root. Additionally, reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells, suggesting a transcriptional control process that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots. Plant roots elongate by producing new cells in the root apical meristem at the root tip. As roots extend further into the soil environment, the newly formed root tissue is naturally exposed to microbial attack, challenging the successful establishment of root systems. However, microbial colonization at the meristematic zone is rarely detected . The sensitive tissue of meristematic stem cells is surrounded by the root cap, a specialized root organ that orchestrates root architecture, directs root growth based on gravitropism and hydrotropism, and senses environmental stimuli. In addition, the root cap is presumed to have a protective function in soil exploration . In Arabidopsis thaliana ( hereafter Arabidopsis ), the root cap consists of two distinct tissues: the centrally located columella root cap at the very root tip and the peripherally located lateral root cap ( LRC ), which flanks both the columella and the entire root meristem . A ring of specific stem cells continuously generates both new LRC cells and root epidermal cells . However, despite the constant production of LRC cells, the root cap itself does not grow in size but matches the size of the meristem . To maintain size homeostasis, root cap development is a highly regulated process that varies in different plant species. In Arabidopsis, a combination of dPCD and shedding of old cells into the rhizosphere has been described . The centrally located columella root cap along with adjacent proximal LRC cells is shed as a cell package, followed by a PCD process . In contrast, LRC cells at the distal end of the root tip elongate and reach the edge of the meristematic zone where they undergo dPCD followed by corpse clearance on the root surface, orchestrated as part of a terminal differentiation program by the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC33/SOMBRERO . SMB belongs to a plant-specific family of transcription factors carrying a NAC domain ( NAM - no apical meristem; ATAF1 and –2, and CUC2 - cup-shaped cotyledon ). SMB promotes the expression of genes associated with the initiation and execution of LRC cell death, including the senescence-associated bifunctional nuclease BFN1 and the putative aspartic protease PASPA3 . BFN1 localizes in the ER, but upon cell death the protein is released and its nuclease activity ensures rapid and irreversible degradation of RNA and DNA in the nucleus and cytoplasm as part of a rapid cell-autonomous corpse clearance at the root surface . Accordingly, DNA and RNA degradation in bfn1-1 loss-of-function mutants is delayed .

[ABSTRACT] Large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to spreading pathogenic protein aggregates and promoting inflammatory responses, two mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative disease. Factors that regulate the extrusion of large vesicles, such as exophers produced by proteostressed C. elegans touch neurons, are poorly understood. Here, we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the C. elegans ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of C. elegans germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. Overall, genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths and genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths. In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs, ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or even fluid, supporting that distention consequences, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus. We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease. In neurodegenerative disease, prions and protein aggregates can transfer among cells of the nervous system to promote pathology spread . Determination of the factors that enhance or deter pathological transfer is, therefore, a central goal in the effort to clinically address neurodegenerative disease. Study of aggregate transfer in the context of the mammalian brain is a major experimental challenge as events are rare, sporadic, and transiently apparent, and tissue is not easily accessible for in vivo observation. We model aggregate transfer by proteostressed ALMR touch receptor neurons in the living C. elegans nervous system , an experimental system that enables molecular and genetic manipulation and evaluation in a physiological context, directly through the transparent cuticle . More specifically, C. elegans adult neurons can extrude large vesicles called exophers ( ~5 µm; 100 X larger than exosomes ) that carry potentially deleterious proteins and organelles out of the neuron . Disrupting proteostasis via diminished chaperone expression, autophagy, or proteasome activity, or over-expressing aggregating proteins like human Alzheimer’s disease associated fragment Aβ1-42, expanded polyglutamine Q128 protein, or high concentration mCherry fluorophore, increases exopher production from the affected neurons. Neurons that express proteotoxic transgenes maintain higher functionality if those neurons produce exophers as compared to those that do not, suggesting that exopher-genesis can be neuroprotective, at least in young adult neurons. Extruded exopher contents can be transferred to neighboring glial-like hypodermal cells for content degradation in the lysosomal network . Several mammalian models feature similar biology , and thus we speculate that the basic transfer biology represents a conserved process that can be recruited for animal-wide proteostasis balance. Neuronal exophers are generated only in adult animals, with an unexpected pattern of a peak at young adult days 2–3 and then later in age with more variable onset . While using chemical regent 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine ( FUdR ) to block progeny production for aging studies, we found that blocking reproduction strongly limited the early adult peak of exopher production.

[ABSTRACT] Increasing evidence supports a role for deficient Wnt signaling in Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ). Studies reveal that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 ( DKK3 ) colocalizes to amyloid plaques in AD patients. Here, we investigate the contribution of DKK3 to synapse integrity in healthy and AD brains. Our findings show that DKK3 expression is upregulated in the brains of AD subjects and that DKK3 protein levels increase at early stages in the disease. In hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse AD models, extracellular DKK3 levels are increased and DKK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques. Functionally, DKK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. In contrast, DKK3 knockdown restores synapse number and memory in hAPP-J20 mice. Collectively, our findings identify DKK3 as a new driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD. Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) is the most common form of dementia in the aging population. The disease is characterized by progressive synaptic dysfunction and loss, early signatures that correlate with cognitive decline in AD and precede both neuronal death and the onset of severe dementia by at least 10 years . Current AD models suggest that amyloid-β ( Aβ ) initiates a pathophysiological cascade leading to synapse failure and eventually cognitive decline. Although the primary neuropathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, soluble Aβ oligomers ( Aβo ) are considered one of the key toxic proteins driving synapse dysfunction . However, the exact mechanisms by which Aβo impair synapse function and cause their degeneration are not fully understood. Increasing evidence suggests that Wnt signaling is compromised in AD, contributing to synapse degeneration. Wnts are secreted proteins that play a crucial role in synapse formation, synaptic plasticity, and synapse integrity . The canonical Wnt pathway is particularly impaired in AD. For example, levels of the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 ( DKK1 ) are increased in the brain of AD patients and AD models . DKK1 promotes synapse degeneration and its blockade protects against Aβ-induced dendritic spine and synapse loss . Supporting the role of deficient Wnt signaling in AD, three genetic variants of LRP6, a crucial Wnt co-receptor, are linked to late-onset AD and confer decreased Wnt signaling in cell lines . Notably, mice carrying the Lrp6-Valine variant exhibit increased synapse vulnerability during aging and in AD . Furthermore, loss-of-function of Lrp6 exacerbates amyloid pathology in an AD mouse model . In addition, Frizzled-1 ( Fz1 ) and Fz7, Wnt receptors present at synapses, are downregulated in the hippocampus of AD subjects and AD models . However, the molecular mechanisms by which deficient Wnt signaling contributes to synaptic defects in AD are poorly understood. Importantly, it remains unexplored whether amelioration of Wnt deficiency restores synaptic connectivity and memory in AD. Dickkopf-3 ( DKK3 ), a member of the secreted Wnt antagonist DKK family, could contribute to AD pathogenesis. Like other DKKs, DKK3 has two cysteine-rich domains but it also contains an elongated N-terminus with a Soggy domain . Although studies suggest that DKK3 antagonizes the Wnt canonical pathway , the function of DKK3 in the adult brain is unclear. Dkk3 knock-out mice are viable and do not exhibit morphological alterations in the brain, but female mice manifest hyperlocomotion .

[ABSTRACT] The global rise of antibiotic resistance calls for new drugs against bacterial pathogens. A common approach is to search for natural compounds deployed by microbes to inhibit competitors. Here, we show that the iron-chelating pyoverdines, siderophores produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp., have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. A screen of 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates used against 12 human pathogens uncovered several pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of the pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Pyoverdine increased survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Furthermore, experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. Thus, pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens. There are approximately 4. 95 million fatalities associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria worldwide each year . This high mortality rate contrasts with the low development rate of new antibacterial agents for clinical applications . Thus, the development of alternative therapies with higher sustainability to counteract the rapidly dwindling treatment options due to resistance evolution is imperative . Numerous alternative approaches have been proposed, including phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides and nanobodies, antivirulence treatments to disarm pathogens, treatments that capitalize on ecological competition between susceptible and resistant bacteria, and the search for new antibacterial compounds produced by environmental microbes . Mining natural microbial communities has become a promising endeavor in the hunt for new antimicrobials because most microbes deploy bioactive compounds to contend with their competitors in the diverse assemblies they live in. Competition often involves the secretion of secondary metabolites with specific antimicrobial properties against other microbes . The isolation, characterization, and synthesis of such secondary metabolites can result in new prospective antibiotics for clinical applications . Secondary metabolites that act as toxins to kill competitors are often considered promising candidates. However, microbes compete through a variety of mechanisms other than toxins. For example, there is increasing evidence that competition for iron is a main determinant of species interactions in soil and freshwater communities . Competition for iron involves the secretion of siderophores, a class of secondary metabolites that scavenges environmental iron with high affinity . Because siderophores are often species specific, they have two opposing effects: they make iron available for related community members possessing the matching receptor but withhold iron from competitors with non-matching receptors. Thus, siderophores can be competitive agents in inter-species interactions . Here, we apply the concept of siderophore-mediated iron competition observed in natural communities to human opportunistic pathogens. Specifically, we investigate whether siderophores from non-pathogenic environmental bacteria can induce iron starvation and growth arrest in human pathogens. We focus on pyoverdines, a class of siderophores with high iron affinity that are produced and secreted by fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. under iron-limited conditions . Upon complexation with ferric iron, the iron-loaded pyoverdine is imported into the cell by receptors with high specificity and then reduced to the bio-available ferrous iron . Pyoverdines show an extraordinary structural diversity with more than 70 described variants that differ in their peptide backbone and have an extremely high affinity for iron . For these reasons, we propose that pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp.

[ABSTRACT] Schizophrenia results in part from a failure of prefrontal networks but we lack full understanding of how disruptions at a synaptic level cause failures at the network level. This is a crucial gap in our understanding because it prevents us from discovering how genetic mutations and environmental risks that alter synaptic function cause prefrontal network to fail in schizophrenia. To address that question, we developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits that can explain the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits we recently observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. We analyze how the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influence oscillatory spike synchrony to inform the biological data. We show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs such as might occur during behavior. These findings strongly parallel dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony we observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior, as well as the suppression of this 0-lag spiking by administration of NMDAR antagonists. As such, our cortical network model provides a plausible process explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. NMDAR synaptic malfunction has been implicated as causal in schizophrenia , and loss of NMDAR synaptic function in prefrontal networks is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits as well as clinical symptoms in the disease . However, we do not have a complete understanding of how NMDAR synaptic mechanisms influence neural dynamics in prefrontal networks, nor how the disruption of NMDAR synaptic mechanisms might cause prefrontal networks to malfunction. To address these questions, we recently investigated how blocking NMDAR altered neural dynamics and effective communication between neurons in prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing a cognitive control task measuring deficits in schizophrenia . We found that reducing NMDAR synaptic communication reduced the frequency of synchronous ( ‘0-lag’ ) spiking between neurons, as well as effective communication between neurons on timescales consistent with monosynaptic interactions between them . Whereas these studies suggested that NMDAR synaptic function and spike timing in prefrontal networks were linked, they did not explained the circuit mechanisms responsible. In the current study, we developed a spiking neural network model to understand mechanisms that might mediate the link between NMDAR synaptic malfunction and neural dynamics ( reduced 0-lag synchronous spiking ) we observed in biological data . The network is comprised of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons embedded in a sparsely connected recurrent network employing realistic NMDAR, GABAR, and AMPAR mediated synaptic currents. We use network stability and mean field analyses to investigate how the balance between NMDA and AMPA components of recurrent excitatory and GABA inhibitory currents influence regimes of network dynamics and spiking synchrony. For cortical neurons synchrony can occur naturally due to the local recurrent network connectivity, even when external afferent inputs are entirely uncorrelated. Theoretical studies have shown that such synchrony can arise in randomly connected recurrent networks operating in asynchronous irregular and synchronous irregular regimes . In both regimes, individual neurons fire spikes highly irregularly at low rates, a typical situation in a cortex. The major distinction is that in an asynchronous regime population spike rate is steady in time, whereas in a synchronous regime it becomes oscillatory.

[ABSTRACT] Angiogenesis is a morphogenic process resulting in the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, usually in hypoxic micro-environments. The initial steps of angiogenesis depend on strong differentiation of oligopotent endothelial cells into the Tip and Stalk phenotypic cell fates, controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell–cell communication. The dynamics of spatial patterning of this cell fate specification are only partially understood. Here, by combining a controlled experimental angiogenesis model with mathematical and computational analyses, we find that the regular spatial Tip–Stalk cell patterning can undergo an order–disorder transition at a relatively high input level of a pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. The resulting differentiation is strong but temporally unstable for most cells, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions. We further find that sprouts form in a manner maximizing their mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that may depend on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin. Together, our data suggest that NOTCH signaling mediates a strong way of cell differentiation enabling but not instructing subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis, which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms. This analysis can assist in further understanding of cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and other complex morphogenic processes. Angiogenesis, that is, the formation of new blood vessels from the pre-existing ones, is a striking example of phenotypic plasticity in an adult differentiated endothelium. Pro-angiogenic factors secreted in response to hypoxic conditions, particularly the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ), specify differentiation of endothelial cells lining blood vessels into diverse phenotypic states, including the pro-migratory Tip cell phenotype. Tip cells can initiate invasive cell migration into the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ECM ), leading to sprouting and branching of the nascent vessels . Tip cells are differentiated from Stalk cells, another phenotypic state, through juxtacrine cell–cell interaction between these cell types involving NOTCH1 signaling, triggered and modulated by induction of Dll4 and Jag1 ligands . Stalk cells can therefore form in immediate proximity of Tip cells, particularly, at the leading edge of an extending sprout, if the NOTCH signaling is sufficiently pronounced for the Tip–Stalk differentiation to occur. Proliferation of Stalk cells is as essential as the invasive migration of Tip cells for the emergence, extension and branching of growing sprouts, making the analysis of coordinated Tip and Stalk specification particularly important. The inputs specifying the cell fate can be potentially contradictory, for example, with pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, promoting the Tip cell fate, and the NOTCH signaling activated by the neighboring cells promoting the Stalk cell fate and thus suppressing the Tip cell identity in the same cell. These and other signaling inputs can thus be incoherent in terms of cell fate specification and can result in complex dynamic outcomes that are still poorly understood. Further elucidation of these processes thus requires high-resolution, quantitative experimental measurements tightly coupled with computational analysis. Since such measurements are still challenging in vivo, particularly in mammalian tissues, use of tissue models recapitulating the salient features of the developing vasculature is a key tool in the current analysis of angiogenesis and development of de novo vascular beds. Previously, we and others have developed a set of micro-fabricated experimental angiogenesis models that have had progressively improved biomimetic characteristics . These characteristics include spatially and biochemically appropriate cell micro-environments, composed of components of the ECM and of gradients of growth factors and cytokines around the developing vasculature, which is composed of endothelial cells and pericytes.

[ABSTRACT] Locus coeruleus ( LC ) projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. However, the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown. Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions. In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine. Here, we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice. We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Finally, we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not. The locus coeruleus ( LC ) supports an array of cognitive processes by modulating brain-wide arousal states and responding to salient events in the environment. LC neurons accomplish this via two distinct modes of activity: tonic and phasic. Changes in the frequency of tonic activity are associated with corresponding changes in psychological state. Low tonic activity ( ~0–2 Hz ) is associated with drowsiness or sleep and increasing levels of tonic activity ( ~3–10 Hz ) are associated with increased arousal, progressing from exploration and task engagement to agitation and anxiety states . Bouts of phasic activity ( ~10–20 Hz ) are most often observed during intermediate levels of tonic activity in response to salient environmental events . When locked to task-relevant events, these phasic responses are associated with improved cognitive performance across a variety of tasks . A large body of research supports the idea that the LC is critically involved in memory formation. Monoamine depletion in the LC, noradrenergic and dopaminergic antagonism in multiple brain regions, and direct inhibition of the LC all impair memory across a number of tasks . Conversely, LC stimulation as well as dopamine and norepinephrine agonism can enhance memory . Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus ( HPC ) and other cortical regions . In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the HPC may be more important for memory than norepinephrine . However, studies examining the effect of LC on HPC-dependent memory have generally not distinguished between tonic and phasic LC activity or between dopamine and norepinephrine signaling. In some cases, this distinction is prevented by the use of temporally imprecise manipulations like lesions and drug infusions. In others, it is difficult to determine the importance of time-locked phasic firing because of the use of spatial memory tasks that are commonly used to assess hippocampus ( HPC ) -dependent memory. Because space is a temporally diffuse stimulus, it is difficult to know the exact moments during spatial learning when phasic responses might be important.
