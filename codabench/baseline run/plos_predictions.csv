[ABSTRACT] The intensification of intervention activities against the fatal vector-borne disease gambiense human African trypanosomiasis ( gHAT, sleeping sickness ) in the last two decades has led to a large decline in the number of annually reported cases. However, while we move closer to achieving the ambitious target of elimination of transmission ( EoT ) to humans, pockets of infection remain, and it becomes increasingly important to quantitatively assess if different regions are on track for elimination, and where intervention efforts should be focused. We present a previously developed stochastic mathematical model for gHAT in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and show that this same formulation is able to capture the dynamics of gHAT observed at the health area level ( approximately 10, 000 people ). This analysis was the first time any stochastic gHAT model has been fitted directly to case data and allows us to better quantify the uncertainty in our results. The analysis focuses on utilising a particle filter Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methodology to fit the model to the data from 16 health areas of Mosango health zone in Kwilu province as a case study. The spatial heterogeneity in cases is reflected in modelling results, where we predict that under the current intervention strategies, the health area of Kinzamba II, which has approximately one third of the health zone’s cases, will have the latest expected year for EoT. We find that fitting the analogous deterministic version of the gHAT model using MCMC has substantially faster computation times than fitting the stochastic model using pMCMC, but produces virtually indistinguishable posterior parameterisation. This suggests that expanding health area fitting, to cover more of the DRC, should be done with deterministic fits for efficiency, but with stochastic projections used to capture both the parameter and stochastic variation in case reporting and elimination year estimations. Mathematical models have an important role in the ability to quantify progress towards or achievement of location elimination of transmission ( EoT ) of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis ( gHAT ) . Cases of gHAT—a parasitic infection with a high probability of severe disease and death if left untreated—have greatly declined in the last two decades, predominantly due to ongoing detection and treatment activities in the endemic regions . However, when the target is EoT, it becomes key to estimate the real number of infections, which cannot directly be observed, to understand where transmission is still ongoing and hence where continued intervention efforts are most crucial . It is thus necessary to develop fine-scale models, such that the spatial distribution of infections can be estimated across the endemic regions. The current spatial distribution of gHAT cases is highly dependent on several geographic factors, such as the density of the disease vector—tsetse ( Glossina spp. ) —suitability for the parasite, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, and the location of human settlements and places of work .

[ABSTRACT] Tumor microenvironments ( TMEs ) contain vast amounts of information on patient’s cancer through their cellular composition and the spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations. Exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups, as well as determining the extent to which this information can predict outcomes such as patient survival or treatment success with emerging immunotherapies, is of great interest. Moreover, in the face of a large number of cell interactions to consider, we often wish to identify specific interactions that are useful in making such predictions. We present an approach to achieve these goals based on summarizing spatial relationships in the TME using spatial K functions, and then applying functional data analysis and random forest models to both predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships. This approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments at both identifying important spatial interactions while also controlling the false discovery rate. We further used the proposed approach to interrogate two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients. The methods proposed are publicly available in a companion R package funkycells. Recent advances in cancer treatment, such as immune checkpoint inhibition and other cancer immunotherapies, have sparked a growing interest in studying the cellular composition and spatial organization of the tumor microenvironment ( TME ). The latest innovations in imaging technologies allow for single cell resolution of specific proteins, facilitating in-depth study of the spatial arrangement of cell types within the TME. A wide variety of technologies are available for this purpose, each with different benefits and trade-offs [1–7]. For a review of the available technologies see . In comparing TME data, different spatial relationships between cell types, e. g. between tumor cells and specific immune cell populations, and/or individual proteins, often appear predictive of patient outcomes and may guide therapeutic interventions; see for example . Comparisons between cancer subtypes, e. g. hormone-positive versus hormone-negative breast cancers, or lung squamous cell carcinoma vs lung adenocarcinoma, may provide new insight into tumor biology and guide the development of treatments. A further goal is to identify specific spatial relationships observed in particular patient’s tumor that are useful in predicting an outcome, such as patient survival or response to therapy. Recent results demonstrate that TME data can be used for such prediction in a variety of tumor types . We consider such prediction problems for data sets generated from tumors imaged with Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging ( MIBI ) by means of the MIBIscope in this paper. The MIBIscope uses ion-beam ablation and time-of-flight mass spectrometry to detect up to approximately 40 protein markers on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tissue. Thus, it provides comprehensive data on cell characteristics and their localisation at a single-cell resolution of around 250–400nm . Such data collected on the TME can be considered as marked spatial point patterns [14–16].

[ABSTRACT] Abnormally strong neural synchronization may impair brain function, as observed in several brain disorders. We computationally study how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-emerge, in particular, during ( de ) synchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbation. To investigate the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms, we combine a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms: ( i ) only spike-timing-dependent plasticity ( STDP ), ( ii ) only homeostatic structural plasticity ( hSP ), i. e., without weight-dependent pruning and without STDP, ( iii ) a combination of STDP and hSP, i. e., without weight-dependent pruning, and ( iv ) a combination of STDP and structural plasticity ( SP ) that includes hSP and weight-dependent pruning. To accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing, STDP, and SP, we introduce a simple stochastic SP model, enabling detailed numerical analyses. With tools from network theory, we reveal that structural reorganization may remarkably enhance the network’s level of synchrony. When weaker contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning, synchrony is achieved with significantly sparser connections than in randomly structured networks in the STDP-only model. In particular, the strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction, followed by selective removal of weak contacts, allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections. This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency, degree-degree correlations, and a mixture of degree assortativity. We compare the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model ( i ) with the desynchronization of models ( iii ) and ( iv ). The latter require stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future pre-clinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive stimulus modalities aiming at inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms, e. g., in Parkinson’s disease. Neurons form networks that are plastic in nature. The spiking dynamics of neurons, the weight ( transmission efficiency ) of the synaptic contacts, and the structure of the networks can change with time [1–4]. The plastic nature of neuronal networks enables learning and memory , stabilization of networks in spontaneous and experience-induced conditions , and recovery and rehabilitation after stroke and injuries [9–11]. Alterations in neural plasticity may support pathological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) and epilepsy . Models of plastic neuronal networks are used to study the functioning of specific brain areas in healthy and disordered conditions and to develop therapeutic stimulation methods [15–20]. Plastic networks of leaky integrate-and-fire ( LIF ) model neurons have been used to design and validate effective stimulation methods such as coordinated and random reset ( CR and RR ) stimulation [21–24], which leverage the synaptic weight plasticity to induce therapeutic effects.

[ABSTRACT] Some animals can regenerate large missing regions of their nervous system, requiring mechanisms to restore the pattern, numbers, and wiring of diverse neuron classes. Because injuries are unpredictable, regeneration must be accomplished from an unlimited number of starting points. Coordinated regeneration of neuron-glia architecture is thus a major challenge and remains poorly understood. In planarians, neurons and glia are regenerated from distinct progenitors. We found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing a Delta-encoding gene, delta-2, at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Planarian glia are specified later from dispersed Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors. Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians, but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types. Loss of several delta-2-expressing neuron classes prevented differentiation of the glia associated with them, whereas transplantation of delta-2-expressing photoreceptor neurons was sufficient for glia formation at an ectopic location. Our results suggest a model in which patterned delta-2-expressing neurons instruct phagocytic progenitors to locally differentiate into glia, presenting a process for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types. In animal regeneration certain cell types might need to form in correct relative numbers and positions, a problem referred to here as coordinated regeneration. For example, neurons and glia for certain contexts need to be regenerated in a coordinated architecture, even if they arise from different progenitors. We address this problem of coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians. Planarians are freshwater flatworms that belong to the Spiralian superphylum and are capable of whole-body regeneration and constant tissue turnover. These processes involve a proliferating population of stem cells called neoblasts. Neoblasts are heterogeneous, being comprised of multiple fate-specified classes with distinct gene expression signatures [2–4]. Most differentiated cell types have a corresponding subset of progenitors within the neoblast compartment . Many invertebrates and vertebrates share multipotent progenitors that can give rise to neurons and glial cells ( Fig 1A and [5–9] ). Planarian glia have been established to be specified from “cathepsin+” or phagocytic progenitors, which are distinct from neuron progenitors [4, 10–12]. This phagocytic neoblast class also produces multiple subsets of other phagocytic cells, including pigment cells. Interestingly, these progenitors have transcriptome similarity to muscle progenitors ( shared PLOD1 and FoxF-1 expression ), indicating they have a mesoderm-like identity . Even though most glia in other organisms have been described to be of neuroepithelial origin ( ectoderm ), in most organisms a subset of mesodermal ( e. g., microglia in vertebrates and GLR glia in C. elegans ) or mesectoderm ( midline glia in Drosophila ) derived glial cells have also been described [13–15]. Some neoblast classes, such as for muscle, are comprised of distinct subsets, each displaying a specification program associated with a particular differentiated muscle type ( e. g., longitudinal, circular, intestinal, dorsal-ventral, pharyngeal ) .

[ABSTRACT] New HIV vaccine approaches are focused on eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies. We characterized early gamma-delta ( γδ ) T cell responses starting from pre-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in participants previously characterized for neutralization breadth development. We found significant differences in γδ T cell surface marker expression in participants that developed neutralization breadth compared to those that did not. Activation of γδ T cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells were found to be significantly higher in broad neutralizers during AHI, and associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. In addition, the levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells was associated with early production of founder virus Env-specific IgM. Thus, γδ T cells may promote development of neutralization breadth, which has implications for HIV vaccine strategies. Vaccination is considered a key tool to prevent acquisition and transmission of infectious pathogens. However, vaccination against HIV-1 remains elusive due to the sequence diversity of the HIV-1 envelope ( glyco ) protein ( Env ) and many other factors. Several current HIV-1 vaccine designs are focusing on generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bNAbs ) [1–4]. However, no HIV-1 vaccine has successfully elicited bNAbs. During natural infection, a minority of people living with HIV ( PLWH ) develop bNAbs [5–7]. Therefore, there is great interest in studying the events that lead to bNAb generation in these study participants. Several viral [8–10] and immunological [11–14] factors have been reported to impact bNAb generation. However, most of these studies focused on the chronic phase of infection. Using the RV217 acute HIV infection ( AHI ) cohort , we have previously shown that B cell activation and engagement with founder Env within the first month of viremia are predictive of the development of neutralization breadth years later . Understanding the innate and adaptive immune pathways that promote B cell activation in response to HIV-1 infection could inform HIV-1 vaccine design for the elicitation of neutralization breadth. Gamma delta ( γδ ) T cells are important in the immune response to various types of pathogens ranging from viruses to bacteria and fungi . γδ T cells express a limited repertoire of T cell receptor ( TCR ) V-regions and, in contrast to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells, are not restricted by MHC-I or MHC-II. Furthermore, they share features with other innate like T cells, such as activation by cytokines in the absence of TCR signal or by activating receptors usually associated with NK cell functions . In humans, the most common subset in peripheral blood is defined by expression of the Vδ2 chain and recognize non-peptide phosphoantigens produced by some bacteria and protozoa such as Plasmodium falciparum . These phosphoantigens are sensed by the butyrophilin-3A1 and butyrophilin-2A1 complex.

[ABSTRACT] The spread of cancer from organ to organ ( metastasis ) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths; however, most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread. It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner, and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors ( IL-6R and IL-8R ) with a new bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer. Bispecific antibodies ( BsAbs ), which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects. However, while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential, elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments. Here, we describe a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 BsAb, exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design. We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complexes. Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design. Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) play key roles in inflammation and have been implicated in cancer progression. IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that, along with TNFα and IL-1β, contributes to the early response to infection . IL-6 is produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells in response to pathogens, and this cytokine drives T cell differentiation as well as plasma B cell differentiation . IL-8 ( CXCL8 ) is a chemokine produced by monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, and other cells [3–5], and it is responsible for attracting leukocytes ( typically but not exclusively neutrophils ) to the site of inflammation by enhancing extravasation and by chemoattraction within tissue . Both IL-6 and IL-8 have been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of several solid tumor types, including breast , prostate , colon , and pancreatic cancers, and indeed elevated expression of both molecules has been associated with increased cancer aggressiveness and metastatic burden . It has recently been demonstrated that IL-6 and IL-8 paracrine signaling in metastatic cancer cells increases motility in a cell density-dependent manner . Above a threshold cell density, cancer cells secrete IL-6 and IL-8, which synergistically activate a complex paracrine signaling pathway via Janus kinase ( JAK2 ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) that prompts cancer cells to form Arp2/3-dependent dendritic protrusions and undergo migration.

[ABSTRACT] Although centrosomes help organize spindles in most cell types, oocytes of most species lack these structures. During acentrosomal spindle assembly in C. elegans oocytes, microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards away from the chromosomes where they form poles, but then these outward forces must be balanced to form a stable bipolar structure. Simultaneously, microtubule dynamics must be precisely controlled to maintain spindle length and organization. How forces and dynamics are tuned to create a stable bipolar structure is poorly understood. Here, we have gained insight into this question through studies of ZYG-8, a conserved doublecortin-family kinase; the mammalian homolog of this microtubule-associated protein is upregulated in many cancers and has been implicated in cell division, but the mechanisms by which it functions are poorly understood. We found that ZYG-8 depletion from oocytes resulted in overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects. Importantly, experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion led to excess outward forces within the spindle and suggested a potential role for this protein in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5. Further, we found that ZYG-8 is also required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte spindle and that kinase activity is required for its function during both meiosis and mitosis. Altogether, our findings reveal new roles for ZYG-8 in oocytes and provide insights into how acentrosomal spindles are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis. In most cell types, centrosomes function to nucleate and organize a microtubule-based spindle . However, oocytes of most species lack centrosomes and yet are able to form a bipolar spindle . In human oocytes, these acentrosomal spindles have been shown to be highly unstable; after bipolarity is achieved, the poles often split apart, and this instability leads to a high incidence of chromosome segregation errors . The mechanisms by which oocyte spindles are formed and stabilized are thus important to understand. In recent years, C. elegans has emerged as a powerful model to dissect mechanisms that promote acentrosomal spindle assembly and maintenance, since rapid depletion methods have been developed that enable the removal of proteins from oocytes within minutes . These methods have made it possible to either deplete proteins prior to spindle formation, to probe for roles in spindle assembly, or to remove proteins from pre-formed spindles and then assess effects on the stability of the structure [7–9]. In C. elegans oocytes, assembly of the spindle begins with nuclear envelope breakdown. Microtubules initially nucleate and form a cage-like structure around the meiotic chromosomes. then, microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards to form multiple poles that eventually coalesce into two distinct poles [10–12]. Thus, to generate a stable spindle structure, forces must be produced during spindle assembly to sort microtubules outwards, and then these forces must be balanced after the spindle forms to maintain proper spindle size.

[ABSTRACT] Circulating metabolite levels have been associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ), but the extent to which T2D affects metabolite levels and their genetic regulation remains to be explained. In this study, we investigate the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and T2D risk in the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel composed of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids ( HDL, IDL, LDL, VLDL ) and lipoproteins. By integrating these data with large-scale T2D GWAS from the DIAMANTE meta-analysis through Mendelian randomization analyses, we find 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D, all spanning lipid-related classes except for Glucose and Tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2D liability, spanning almost all tested classes, including branched-chain amino acids. Secondly, using an interaction quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis, we describe four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions show attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls. The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis are significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but are not associated with T2D risk, pointing towards consequences of T2D on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels. Finally, through differential level analyses, we find 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications, with only a few discriminating between complication classes. Of the 165 metabolites, 40 are not causally linked to T2D in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. Overall, this work provides a map of the consequences of T2D on Nightingale targeted metabolite levels and on their genetic regulation, enabling a better understanding of the T2D trajectory leading to complications. Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is a common, complex disease, with a prevalence that is expected to increase dramatically, and for which the genetics has been largely described through genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) meta-analysis efforts [1–3]. The next step towards translating these associations into the clinic is to understand the biological mechanisms behind them. To this end, multi-omics data such as metabolite levels offer great promise, as they enable the study of molecular phenotypes closely implicated in the disease. A large number of metabolites have been associated with T2D, as highlighted in a recent study from Julkunen et al. , which described 230 metabolites as nominally associated with incident and prevalent T2D. Consistent associations between T2D risk and metabolites across studies mostly cover increases in various amino acid levels, especially branched-chain amino acids ( BCAAs ) [5–7], and dyslipidemia . However, the predictive value of metabolite profiles in T2D risk is still debated. Improved prediction of various complex traits using metabolite profiles over genetic scores has been shown, but this improvement is rather limited when compared to classical risk factors including age, sex and family history of disease .

[ABSTRACT] Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) colonizes humans asymptomatically but can also cause opportunistic infections, ranging from mild skin infections to severe life-threatening conditions. Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection. Resistance is limiting the pathogen burden, while tolerance is limiting the health impact of a given pathogen burden. In previous work, we established that collaborative cross ( CC ) mouse line CC061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection ( MRSA, USA300 ), while CC024 is tolerant. To identify host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection, we crossed CC061 mice and CC024 mice to generate F1 and F2 populations. Survival after MRSA infection in the F1 and F2 generations was 65% and 55% and followed a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the CC024 increased survival phenotype. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in their parents, suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors. We identified a Quantitative Trait Locus ( QTL ) peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. In this QTL, the WSB/EiJ ( WSB ) allele was present in CC024 mice and contributed to their MRSA tolerant phenotype. Two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, have high-impact variants in this region. C5ar1 and C5ar2 are receptors for the complement factor C5a, an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response by binding to these receptors. We hypothesize that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice, reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival. Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) is a gram-positive coccus well-adapted to humans and a variety of companion, farm, and wild animals . S. aureus is a commensal organism as well as an opportunist that can cause severe morbidity and mortality . Globally, S. aureus is one of the leading causes of bacterial-related hospitalizations and is responsible for more than one million deaths annually . S. aureus is a growing cause of concern because it spreads easily, and many isolates are resistant to several classes of antibiotics . Nasal carriage of S. aureus varies widely across the human population . Not all colonized individuals develop infections, but colonization is a risk factor for skin and soft tissue infections . These superficial infections are precursors for 50% of S. aureus bacteremia ( SAB ) , and approximately one-third of SAB cases lead to sepsis . This variability in disease outcomes after S. aureus colonization, suggests that this host-pathogen interaction may depend on both bacterial and host genetics. Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection. Resistance is defined as maintaining health by limiting the pathogen burden, while tolerance is limiting the health impact of infection despite a high pathogen burden . Mechanisms underlying tolerance to infection have recently been described for parasitic and viral infections .

[ABSTRACT] The tempo and mode of adaptation depends on the availability of beneficial alleles. Genetic interactions arising from gene networks can restrict this availability. However, the extent to which networks affect adaptation remains largely unknown. Current models of evolution consider additive genotype-phenotype relationships while often ignoring the contribution of gene interactions to phenotypic variance. In this study, we model a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network, the negative autoregulation motif. Using forward-time genetic simulations, we measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. A key expectation from adaptive walk theory is that the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations is exponential. We found that both models instead harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected. The network model also had a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations, with a considerable density at deleterious selection coefficients. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. Our results suggest that the interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects. The leading theory of adaptive walks was developed by Gillespie and Orr [12–14]. Under this theory, adaptive walks are characterized by a sequence of mutations with diminishing effect sizes. A key prediction of the Gillespie-Orr model is that the fitness effects of beneficial mutations sampled during adaptation form a negative exponential distribution . This shape emerges as populations approach the optimum phenotype: large effect mutations become progressively disadvantageous due to the increased risk of “overshooting” the optimum. Gillespie recognized that extreme-value theory—a statistical branch focused on sampling from extreme tails of distributions—could be integrated into the genetic theory of adaptation to study the DFE. To understand this connection, consider the distribution of fitnesses among all genotypes. Under normal circumstances, the wild-type genotype should have relatively high fitness, and hence it belongs to the right tail of this distribution. The remainder of the right tail of the DFE consists of beneficial mutations. Extreme value theory predicts that this right tail can be described by a family of distributions termed the extreme value distribution ( EVD ). Gillespie posited that adaptive steps are samples from the EVD . Studying the shape of the EVD highlights the availability of beneficial mutations to a population and which effect sizes are likely to contribute to adaptation. The EVD can be broadly categorized into one of three “domains of attraction”, or shapes: the Gumbel, Weibull, or Fréchet family of distributions ( Fig 1; [16–18] ). Gillespie argued that the Gumbel is most likely to represent empirical DFEs as it captures common distributions such as the normal, gamma, and log-normal . The Gillespie-Orr exponential expectation outlined above assumes a Gumbel domain . Mutagenesis studies and spontaneous mutation experiments largely support this theoretical expectation ( e. g. [14, 19–24] ).

[ABSTRACT] A fundamental function of cortical circuits is the integration of information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. While animals behave as if they optimally integrate information according to Bayesian probability theory, the implementation of the required computations in the biological substrate remains unclear. We propose a new, Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses which suggests that they are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration. In our approach apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances. We formally demonstrate that under these assumptions the somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior. We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule, allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities. Our theory explains various experimental findings on the system and single-cell level related to multi-sensory integration, which we illustrate with simulations. Furthermore, we make experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity. Successful actions are based on information gathered from a variety of sources. This holds as true for individuals as it does for whole societies. For instance, experts, political parties, and special interest groups may all have different opinions on proposed legislature. How should one combine these different views ? One might, for example, weight them according to their relative reliability, estimated from demonstrated expertise. According to Bayesian probability theory, the combined reliability-weighted view contains more information than any of the individual views taken on its own and thus provides an improved basis for subsequent actions . Such problems of weighting and combining information from different sources are commonplace for our brains. Whether inputs from neurons with different receptive fields or inputs from different modalities ( Fig 1a ), our cortex needs to combine these uncertain information sources into a coherent basis that enables informed actions. Bayesian probability theory provides clear recipes for how to optimally solve such problems, but so far the implementation in the biological substrate is unclear. Previous work has demonstrated that multiple interacting neuronal populations can efficiently perform such probabilistic computations . These studies provided mechanistic models potentially underlying the often Bayes-optimal behavior observed in humans and other animals . Here we demonstrate that probabilistic computations may be even deeper ingrained in our biological substrate, in single cortical neurons. We suggest that each dendritic compartment, here interpreted as logical subdivision of a complex morphology, represents either a ( Gaussian ) likelihood function or a ( Gaussian ) prior distribution over somatic potentials. These are parametrized by the local effective reversal potential and the membrane conductance. Basal dendrites receiving bottom-up input represent likelihoods, while apical dendrites receiving top-down input, represent priors. We show that the natural dynamics of leaky integrator models compute the corresponding posterior.

[ABSTRACT] Protein structure prediction has now been deployed widely across several different large protein sets. Large-scale domain annotation of these predictions can aid in the development of biological insights. Using our Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains ( ECOD ) from experimental structures as a basis for classification, we describe the detection and cataloging of domains from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database. On average, we can provide positive classification ( either of domains or other identifiable non-domain regions ) for 90% of residues in all proteomes. We classified 746, 349 domains from 536, 808 proteins comprised of over 226, 424, 000 amino acid residues. We examine the varying populations of homologous groups in both eukaryotes and bacteria. In addition to containing a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains, eukaryotes show a higher proportion of repeated proteins, both globular and small repeats. We enumerate those highly populated domains that are shared in both eukaryotes and bacteria, such as the Rossmann domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. Additionally, we compare the sampling of homologous groups from this whole proteome set against our stable ECOD reference and discuss groups that have been enriched by structure predictions. Finally, we discuss the implication of these results for protein target selection for future classification strategies for very large protein sets. Protein domains are independent evolutionary units that convey function and fitness either singly or in concert. The study of domains and their homology is a powerful tool for studying protein function [1–3]. Homologous domains can share function, and the propagation of functional annotation from experimentally characterized proteins and their domains to their homologous yet hypothetical or uncharacterized domains can lead to biological insights [4–7]. Protein domain classifications determine and organize these homologous domains and either 1 ) sequence classifications such as Pfam , CDD , or SUPERFAMILY that partition protein sequence into domains and derive their taxonomy principally by sequence similarity measures or 2 ) structure classifications such as SCOP , CATH , or ECOD that use structural similarity to determine more distant homology ( at the cost of access to fewer proteins ). The advent of highly accurate structure prediction software may upset this traditional division. The outstanding performance of DeepMind’s AlphaFold2 at CASP14[16–18] led to the subsequent development of software such as RoseTTAFold , ESMFold , and I-TASSER-MTD as well as the widespread prediction of large protein sets resulting in resources such as the AlphaFold Structure database ( AFDB ) and ESM-Atlas . AlphaFold is a deep-learning-based structure prediction method trained on data generated by structural biologists and stored by the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) . Since its release in 2020, it has been used to generate and make available numerous data sets through the AlphaFold Structural Database hosted by the EBI, including 48 whole proteomes, numerous curated proteins within the SWISS-PROT dataset, and 200M predictions representing the known protein universe .

[ABSTRACT] BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure, for which there are no antivirals. The current model is that BKPyV expresses TAg ( large T antigen ) early during infection, promoting cells to enter S phase where the viral DNA can access the host replication machinery. Here, we performed a single-cell analysis of viral TAg expression throughout the cell cycle to reveal that strong TAg expression required replication of the host DNA first. By using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication, we show that both TAg expression and viral production rely on an initial S phase. BKPyV is known to promote cellular re-replication, where the cell re-enters S phase from G2 phase ( without passing through mitosis or G1 phase ) to prolong S phase for viral replication. Thus, BKPyV infection results in cells with greater than 4N DNA content. We found that these subsequent rounds of replication of the host DNA relied on canonical host cell cycle machinery and regulators despite BKPyV infection. Together, these findings suggest a model for polyomavirus replication, where strong viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and that BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication. Having a better understanding of the molecular events that are required for BKPyV production will help identify effective therapeutic targets against BKPyV. BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a small, double-stranded DNA virus that persistently infects the kidneys of approximately 180% of adults worldwide . Although BKPyV reactivation is asymptomatic in healthy individuals, it causes graft loss in kidney transplant patients and is associated with increased risk of bladder cancer [3–5]. Despite the prevalence of BKPyV and the severity of complications, there are currently no specific treatments for BKPyV reactivation . While BKPyV relies on the host replication machinery to replicate the viral DNA, it provides its own helicase, large tumor antigen ( TAg ) . BKPyV replication using TAg and host replication machinery activates a cascade of kinases known as the DNA damage response ( DDR ), which prolongs S phase and is necessary for strong viral replication . Following viral replication, BKPyV expresses the structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3, which encapsidate newly synthesized genomes to produce infectious virions . While other DNA tumor viruses prevent host DNA replication through DDR activation, BKPyV uses DDR activation to induce and maintain host re-replication . Importantly, the re-replication phenotype of the host DNA is also found in kidney biopsies from transplant patients with uncontrolled BKPyV reactivation, in which enormous, TAg+ nuclei are observed . Given this requirement of host re-replication and the evidence of re-replication in vivo, a mechanistic understanding of how BKPyV induces re-replication is required. Human DNA replication is temporally separated into two steps: origin licensing and origin firing .

[ABSTRACT] Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ). While most existing TWAS approaches focus on marginal analyses through examining one gene at a time, recent developments in TWAS fine-mapping methods enable the joint modeling of multiple genes to refine the identification of potentially causal ones. However, these fine-mapping methods have primarily focused on modeling quantitative traits and examining local genomic regions, leading to potentially suboptimal performance. Here, we present FABIO, a TWAS fine-mapping method specifically designed for binary traits that is capable of modeling all genes jointly on an entire chromosome. FABIO employs a probit model to directly link the genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) of genes to binary outcomes while taking into account the GReX correlation among all genes residing on a chromosome. As a result, FABIO effectively controls false discoveries while offering substantial power gains over existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches. We performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of FABIO and applied it for in-depth analyses of six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank. In the real datasets, FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27. 9%-36. 9% over existing approaches across traits. Leveraging its improved power, FABIO successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases, including GATA3 for asthma, ABCG2 for gout, and SH2B3 for hypertension. Overall, FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have gained significant popularity in the field of genetics as they are capable of integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) to uncover potentially causal associations between genes and traits [1–3]. However, the traditional approach of conducting marginal TWAS analyses, which examine one gene at a time, has important limitations. In such analyses, the focus is solely on testing the marginal association between genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) of a single gene and a trait of interest. This approach overlooks the fact that neighboring genes often exhibit correlated expression levels and share cis-SNPs that are in close linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) with each other . Consequently, genes detected through marginal TWAS may not necessarily be causal but rather represent tag genes in the region. To overcome the limitation of marginal TWAS analysis, several statistical methods for TWAS fine-mapping, including FOCUS ( fine-mapping of causal gene sets ) and FOGS ( Fine-mapping Of Gene Sets ) , have been developed [7–9]. These TWAS fine-mapping methods can prioritize associated genes by jointly modeling multiple genes within a specific region of interest. The TWAS fine-mapping methods begin by constructing GReX prediction models using data from eQTL mapping studies . The constructed prediction models are then used to impute GReX in GWAS, enabling the association testing between GReX and the trait of interest at the locus level.

[ABSTRACT] Misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms. When misfolded proteins evade quality control, they can be sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent the potential dysfunction and toxicity that arises from protein aggregation. Btn2 and Hsp42 are compartment-specific sequestrases that play key roles in the assembly of these deposition sites. Their exact intracellular functions and substrates are not well defined, particularly since heat stress sensitivity is not observed in deletion mutants. We show here that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress conditions induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Btn2 and Hsp42 act to sequester oxidized proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure and their absence leads to an accumulation of protein aggregates. The toxicity of protein aggregate accumulation causes oxidant sensitivity in btn2 hsp42 sequestrase mutants since overexpression of the Hsp104 disaggregase rescues oxidant tolerance. We have identified the Sup35 translation termination factor as an in vivo sequestrase substrate and show that Btn2 and Hsp42 act to suppress oxidant-induced formation of the yeast [PSI+] prion, which is the amyloid form of Sup35. [PSI+] prion formation in sequestrase mutants does not require IPOD ( insoluble protein deposit ) localization which is the site where amyloids are thought to undergo fragmentation and seeding to propagate their heritable prion form. Instead, both amorphous and amyloid Sup35 aggregates are increased in btn2 hsp42 mutants consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress conditions in the absence of sequestrase activity. Taken together, our data identify protein sequestration as a key antioxidant defence process that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation. Proteostasis is maintained by an arsenal of molecular chaperones that are able to detect non-native, misfolded proteins and act upon them to prevent aggregation or to mitigate their toxic consequences . This means that misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms. When misfolded proteins evade these quality control systems, they form aggregates that are implicated in a number of protein misfolding diseases . More recently, the organized sequestration of misfolded proteins to defined inclusion sites has been recognized as a regulated process that depends on dedicated molecular chaperones, termed sequestrases [3–5]. The sequestration of misfolded proteins into intracellular deposit sites helps cells to cope with an accumulation of misfolded proteins by partitioning them away from their normal productive pathways, protecting against potential cytotoxic effects and by facilitating targeted degradation . Although aggregation is a well-studied effect and many key players are known, it remains unclear exactly how different growth and stress conditions cause protein aggregation and the degree of stress specificity in the chaperone response to aggregate formation is unknown. The spatial sequestration of misfolded proteins is a highly conserved protein quality control ( PQC ) strategy, but the subcellular localization of deposition sites differs between organisms [7–9].

[ABSTRACT] Glioblastoma ( GBM ) invasion studies have focused on coding genes, while few studies evaluate long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ), transcripts without protein-coding potential, for role in GBM invasion. We leveraged CRISPR-interference ( CRISPRi ) to evaluate invasive function of GBM-associated lncRNAs in an unbiased functional screen, characterizing and exploring the process of identified candidates. We implemented a CRISPRi lncRNA loss-of-function screen evaluating association of lncRNA knockdown ( KD ) with invasion capacity in Matrigel. Top screen candidates were validated using CRISPRi and oligonucleotide ( ASO ) -mediated knockdown in three tumor lines. Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and Genotype-Tissue Expression ( GTEx ) survival analysis. Mediators of lncRNA effect were identified via differential expression analysis following lncRNA KD and assessed for tumor invasion using knockdown and rescue experiments. Forty-eight lncRNAs were significantly associated with 33–83% decrease in invasion ( p<0. 01 ) upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC03045, identified from effect size and p-value, demonstrated 82. 7% decrease in tumor cell invasion upon knockdown, while LINC03045 expression was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade . RNAseq analysis of LINC03045 knockdown revealed that WASF3, previously implicated in tumor invasion studies, was highly correlated with lncRNA expression, while WASF3 KD was associated with significant decrease in invasion. Finally, WASF3 overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive function lost with LINC03045 KD. CRISPRi screening identified LINC03045, a previously unannotated lncRNA, as critical to GBM invasion. Gene expression is significantly associated with tumor grade and survival. RNA-seq and mechanistic studies suggest that this new lncRNA may regulate invasion via WASF3. Glioblastoma ( GBM ) is the most common and aggressive adult primary malignant brain tumor, with an estimated annual incidence of 17, 000 new cases per year in the USA . Standard of care treatment includes surgical resection, chemotherapy with temozolomide ( TMZ ), and radiation therapy, but despite the available therapeutic options, mean survival remains at about 12 to 15 months and the five-year survival rate at 5. 5% [2–5]. The majority of GBM patients also invariably experience tumor recurrence with increased chemo- and radio-resistance, and there is no standardized second line of management after initial adjuvant treatment. Further evidence suggests that microscopic tumor invasion beyond gross radiographic and intraoperatively visualized tumor specimen contributes to continued tumor growth despite gross total radiographic resection [6–8]. The limited efficacy of treatment options necessitates new therapeutic strategies and molecular targets that can limit this tumor invasion and subsequent tumor recurrence. While current genetic studies in glioma research have primarily focused on targeting coding genes, about 80% of the genome is composed of non-coding RNAs . Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) are transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides that do not code for proteins but have demonstrated involvement in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation.

[ABSTRACT] It has been classically conjectured that the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli. An important issue associated with this conjecture is the identification of the classes of models used by the brain to perform this task. We address this issue by using a new clustering procedure for sets of electroencephalographic ( EEG ) data recorded from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain. This clustering procedure indicates that the brain uses the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus to build a model. It has been proposed that the brain identifies statistical regularities in sequences of stimuli and organises these regularities to be able to classify the stimuli and to make predictions. How the brain proceeds to identify and to classify statistical regularities is still essentially an open question. Proposals on how the brain implements this issue have been suggested. For example, the brain may use Bayesian inference to estimate parameters relevant for the identification of statistical regularities [1–5]. Recently Duarte et al. and Hernández et al. proposed the use of probabilistic context tree models to represent the statistical regularities displayed by stochastic sequences of auditory stimuli. Employing this approach it was possible to extract, from EEG data, the regularities matching the algorithm used to generate the random sequence of stimuli. In the procedure to generate the sequence of auditory stimuli is defined by a context tree and an associated family of transition probabilities used to choose each next stimulus given the context associated to the sequence of past stimuli at each time step. A model selection procedure allowed Duarte et al. and Hernández et al. to retrieve from the EEG signals recorded at the prefrontal cortex the context tree governing the sequence of auditory stimuli. In spite of the interest of all these works, each one of them assumes a particular class of models used by the brain to organise the set of statistical regularities of sequences of stimuli. However, the identification of the class of models actually used by the brain remains an open question. We propose to address this question by using a new clustering procedure for sets of EEG data collected while participants were exposed to sequences of auditory stimuli driven by a context tree. Clustering procedures have the property of retrieving any possible partition of sets of objects. Therefore, using a cluster-based scheme to model data should allow us to select a more parsimonious model of the EEG data in . By identifying natural groupings in data, clustering analysis allows to identify patterns and relationships, with applications in pattern recognition, data compression, biological and medical research and social sciences . There are many procedures to cluster data but there is no one size fits all strategy. The clustering technique depends on the nature and distribution of the data set.

[ABSTRACT] While single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) is a popular method to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, it harbors shortcomings: The failure to account for cell-to-cell variations of transcriptome-size ( i. e., the total number of transcripts per cell ) and also cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression. This is particularly a problem when analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues/organs, which requires cell dissociation for the analysis. As a result, there exists a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq result and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq result using its composite scRNA-seq data. To fix this problem, we propose a computationally calculated coefficient, “cell type-specific weighting-factor ( cWF ) ”. Here, we introduce a concept and a method of its computation and report cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs. Their fidelity is validated by more accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data of diverse solid organs using the scRNA-seq data and the cWFs of their composite cells. Furthermore, we also show that cWFs effectively predict aging-progression, implicating their diagnostic applications and also their association with aging process. Our study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues/organs. Furthermore, our findings suggest a diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs. Since the advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) technologies early this century, this method is becoming one of the essential tools in biomedical fields . While scRNA-seq provides useful information of cellular composition and gene expression at single cell resolution, it has limitations. It is well-known that the total number of RNA molecules per cell, also known as transcriptome-size, varies from-cell-to-cell [2–4]. However, in scRNA-seq analyses, the transcripts are sequenced in individual cells and their transcript-counts are normalized, allowing the comparison of the relative abundance of each transcript-species across individual cells/cell-types [5–9]. This internal normalization process of the analyses cancels out the putative transcriptome size-variations among different cells, concealing potentially important functional differences among the cells. This differential transcriptome-size can be determined by counting the library depth of the cells and/or by including normalizing spike-in RNA in the samples . Alternative, it can be quantified by PCR-based methods . However, these approaches are applicable only to culture cells, blood/immune cells, and cancer cells which are relatively uniform cell types and do not require cell dissociation. In contrast, they are not applicable to solid tissues/organs composed of highly heterogeneous cell types. Individual cells can be dissociated from solid tissues/organs and then analyzed by scRNA-seq. However, the cell-dissociation and subsequent harvesting and/or purification steps induce cryptic gene expression . Due to such limitations, it is difficult to measure and compare the absolute transcript-counts of each gene in individual cells of the complex solid tissues/organs such as the heart, brain, kidney, etc. Furthermore, the differential transcriptome-size has biological importance. Several studies indicate that the cell-size influences the overall cellular transcription [15–18].

[ABSTRACT] Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a statistical approach using genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR ( MVMR ) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simulatiously. MR and MVMR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants in the set used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core IV assumptions. Genetic variants that give outlying estimates are often considered to be potentially pleiotropic variants. Radial plots can be used in MR to help identify these variants. Analogous plots for MVMR have so far been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature of the analysis. We propose a radial formulation of MVMR, and an adapted Galbraith radial plot, which allows for the estimated effect of each exposure within an MVMR analysis to be visualised. Radial MVMR additionally includes an option for removal of outlying SNPs which may violate one or more assumptions of MVMR. A RMVMR R package is presented as accompanying software for implementing the methods described. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the radial MVMR approach through simulations and applied analyses. We highlight how outliers with respect to all exposures can be visualised and removed through Radial MVMR. We present simulations that illustrate how outlier removal decreases the bias in estimated effects under various forms of pleiotropy. We apply Radial MVMR to estimate the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease ( CHD ). In combination with simulated examples, we highlight how important features of MVMR analyses can be explored using a range of tools incorporated within the RMVMR R package. Radial MVMR effectively visualises causal effect estimates, and provides valuable diagnostic information with respect to the underlying assumptions of MVMR. Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a methodological framework in which genetic variants- often single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) - are used as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding . MR analyses are often performed using summary data from publicly available genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ), reflecting the ease with which such data can be accessed in contrast with individual-level data . The extent to which MR causal effect estimates are unbiased is largely determined by three key assumptions. SNPs serving as instruments must be robustly associated with the exposure of interest ( IV1 ), there must be no confounding of the SNPs and the outcome ( IV2 ) and there must be no effect of the SNPs on the outcome that does not act via the exposure, i. e. no horizontal pleiotropy ( IV3 ) . If all of these assumptions are satisfied for every SNP then the causal effect estimated by each SNP should differ only due to statistical chance.

[ABSTRACT] Animal behavior spans many timescales, from short, seconds-scale actions to daily rhythms over many hours to life-long changes during aging. To access longer timescales of behavior, we continuously recorded individual Drosophila melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless arenas on sucrose-agarose media. We use the deep learning framework SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances. We identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion and use the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies’ behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment. We find distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors, adding specific information about trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed to what is known about the D. melanogaster circadian cycle. Using our holistic measurements of behavior, we find that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies’ daily pattern of behavior, and that the behavioral composition of this hour tracks well with other indicators of health such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spend moving vs. resting. The method, data, and analysis presented here give us a new and clearer picture of D. melanogaster behavior across timescales, revealing new features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms. Uncovering the temporal structure of behavior has long been a topic of theoretical interest and experimental challenge [1–4]. Animals carry out sequences of behaviors on many timescales, from the short timescales of the individual movements required for grooming, eating, and social communication to the longer timescales of hunger, arousal, diurnal cycles, mating seasons, and the aging process. The specifics of these behavior sequences determine much of what we can characterize about an animal, such as its health, reproductive fitness, and that idiosyncrasy of action that we might call ‘personality. ’ These behavior sequences also give us indirect ways to assess the internal processes of the animal, such as neural activity, gene expression, and other internal states like hunger or fatigue. An important aspect of animal behavior is how different timescales interact, from hours to days to lifespans. Investigating these interactions requires a model organism with a broad variety of behaviors but a short lifespan, to allow us to capture the breadth of all the timescales it might inhabit. Drosophila melanogaster have a rich set of behaviors, many of which are spontaneous and can occur in simple, isolated environments. Over the course of a 24-h light/dark cycle D. melanogaster have varying activity levels across hours, with particular peaks of activity in the morning and evening that are controlled by distinct populations of neurons . As D. melanogaster age their circadian cycles break down , and their activity over different hours loses a defined pattern.

[ABSTRACT] Protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type ( PTPNs ) have been studied extensively in the context of the adaptive immune system; however, their roles beyond immunoregulation are less well explored. Here we identify new functions for the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTPN-22, establishing its role in nematode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. Through a non-biased genetic screen, we found that loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 ( human NEK8/NEK9 ) and NEKL-3 ( human NEK6/NEK7 ), which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation. To better understand the functions of PTPN-22, we carried out proximity labeling studies to identify candidate interactors of PTPN-22 during development. Through this approach we identified the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 ( human DNMBP ) as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22. Consistent with this interaction, loss of DNBP-1 also suppressed nekl-associated molting defects. Genetic analysis, co-localization studies, and proximity labeling revealed roles for PTPN-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesmosomes, suggesting that PTPN-22 plays a broad role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. Localization and proximity labeling also implicated PTPN-22 in functions connected to nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly within the germline, as nearly one-third of proteins identified by PTPN-22 proximity labeling are known P granule components. Collectively, these studies highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying new gene functions. Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation is a key process for regulating diverse cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and signal transduction. The steady-state level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is regulated by the coordinated effects of protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) and protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ). Of the 518 protein kinases in humans, 90 ( 17% ) are classified as PTKs, whereas of the 200 protein phosphatases, 108 ( 54% ) are classified as PTPs [1–3]. Despite their greater abundance, PTPs have garnered less attention from researchers than PTKs. Nevertheless, it is known that dysfunction of PTPs can disrupt the homeostasis of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, contributing to a spectrum of disorders including cancers and neuronal and autoimmune diseases [4–9]. Notably, among the 237 protein phosphatases in C. elegans, 94 are presumed to be PTPs and over 50% of C. elegans phosphatases have human orthologs . Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type ( PTPN ) is a subset of the PTP family comprising 17 protein tyrosine phosphatases in humans. One well-studied member of this family, PTPN22, has been investigated primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin including lymphocytes, monocytes, natural killer cells, and platelets [12–17]. Correspondingly, one of the most well-characterized functions of PTPN22 is the suppression of T-cell activation. In conjunction with C-terminal Src tyrosine kinase ( CSK ), PTPN22 is responsible for dephosphorylating T-cell signaling receptors including LCK, FYN, CD3ζ, and ZAP-70 .

[ABSTRACT] Current malaria elimination targets must withstand a colossal challenge–resistance to the current gold standard antimalarial drug, namely artemisinin derivatives. If artemisinin resistance significantly expands to Africa or India, cases and malaria-related deaths are set to increase substantially. Spatial information on the changing levels of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia is therefore critical for health organisations to prioritise malaria control measures, but available data on artemisinin resistance are sparse. We use a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 ( K13 ) gene, which are known to be associated with artemisinin resistance, and a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artemisinin resistance. Our maps of estimated prevalence show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022. Moreover, the period between 2010 and 2015 demonstrated the most spatial change across the region. Our model and maps provide important insights into the spatial and temporal trends of artemisinin resistance in a way that is not possible using data alone, thereby enabling improved spatial decision support systems on an unprecedented fine-scale spatial resolution. By predicting for the first time spatio-temporal patterns and extents of artemisinin resistance at the subcontinent level, this study provides critical information for supporting malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia. Antimalarial drugs are essential tools for the control and elimination of malaria. Resistance to all currently available antimalarials, including the pivotal artemisinin derivatives, have been confirmed. This situation is dire considering how the multi-foci emergence and spread of resistance to other antimalarial drugs–chloroquine and, later, sulphadoxine–pyrimethamine ( SP ) –have resulted in dramatic increases in malaria-related morbidity and mortality . Studies conducted in 2006–2007 first reported that P. falciparum in north-west Cambodia had reduced in vivo susceptibility to artemisinins, which manifested as delayed clearance of parasites from the blood of patients treated with ACTs . Delayed parasite clearance in P. falciparum infections following artemisinin-based therapies is the clinical hallmark of resistance . P. falciparum infections with significantly slowed parasite clearance under artemisinin-based therapies have now been detected in neighbouring countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion; namely in Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar . Spatial information on changes to antimalarial resistance is critical for health organisations to prioritise control measures, but available data on artemisinin resistance are sparse. No such fine-scale predictive maps exist for artemisinin resistance within Southeast Asia. However, to generate predictive maps using appropriate model-based geostatistics, large numbers of unique spatio-temporal locations are needed . This is impossible to achieve with clinical measures of resistance; the data are simply not available owing to the expensive and time-consuming nature of clinical studies . A way forward is to use molecular markers associated with resistance. Genetic mutations known to be associated with drug resistance can be used to monitor spatio-temporal trends in antimalarial drug resistance as a proxy of clinical efficacy.

[ABSTRACT] Function-to-find domain ( FIIND ) -containing proteins, including NLRP1 and CARD8, are vital components of the inflammasome signaling pathway, critical for the innate immune response. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain, resulting in full-length ( FL ), cleaved N-terminal ( NT ), and cleaved C-terminal ( CT ) peptides, which form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. However, the detailed process remains elusive. Here, we found that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. Specifically, the Linker3 region located between LRR and FIIND in murine NLRP1b ( mNLRP1b ) plays an essential role in forming the NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes, while the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ) and CARD8 mediates their NT-CT interaction. In addition, we explored the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 ( DPP9 ) in these complexes, revealing differential interactions and the significance of domain structure. Besides the FL-DPP9-CT complex, DPP9 interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b, rNLRP1, and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains, forming NT-DPP9-CT complex; however, DPP9 cannot bind to NTs of hNLRP1. Further functional assay indicated that although DPP9 is involved in the NT-CT complex of rodent NLRP1 and CARD8, it does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT. Our study enhanced the understanding of the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation and underscored the complexity of their interactions within the immune response. Inflammasomes are high-molecular-weight multiprotein complexes that play a critical role in detecting pathogenic microorganisms and endogenous danger signals, thereby mediating the activation of inflammatory caspases . In canonical inflammasome pathways, nucleotide-binding-oligomerization-domain-like receptors ( NLRs ) sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) or damage-associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ), typically activating caspase-1 through the adaptor protein Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD ( ASC ) . In noncanonical inflammasomes, murine caspase-11 or human caspase-4/5 directly recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide . Activation of these caspases leads to the cleavage of gasdermin D ( GSDMD ), liberating the pore-forming GSDMD-N domain from the inhibitory GSDMD-C domain, resulting in pore formation in the plasma membrane and subsequent pyroptotic cell death . Additionally, caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to produce mature cytokines during canonical inflammasome activation; notably, human caspase-4 can directly process pro-IL-18 into mature IL-18 during noncanonical inflammasome activation . Among the canonical inflammasome pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ), both NLRP1 and CARD8 contain a unique function-to-find domain ( FIIND ), which undergoes autoproteolysis to yield two noncovalently associated polypeptides: the N terminus ( NT ) and the C terminus ( CT ) . Human NLRP1 ( hNLRP1 ) is structured with an N-terminal PYD, followed by the NACHT domain, LRR, FIIND, and a C-terminal CARD. Three linker regions separate these domains: Linker1 between PYD and NACHT, Linker2 between NACHT and LRR, and Linker3 between LRR and FIIND .

[ABSTRACT] Defects in protein homeostasis can induce proteotoxic stress, affecting cellular fitness and, consequently, overall tissue health. In various growing tissues, cell competition based mechanisms helped detection and elimination of these compromised, often referred to as ‘loser’, cells by the healthier neighbors. The precise connection between proteotoxic stress and competitive cell survival remains largely elusive. Here, we reveal the function of an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi localized protein Rer1 in the regulation of protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. Our results show that loss of Rer1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α. Clonal analysis showed that rer1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition. Interestingly, we find that Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression that causes overgrowth, albeit under high proteotoxic stress. Our results suggest that increased levels of Rer1 provide cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating the proteotoxic stress and thereby supporting Myc-driven overgrowth. In summary, these observations demonstrate that Rer1 acts as a new regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila and reveal its role in competitive cell survival. The development of healthy tissue requires the removal of viable but suboptimal cells. In several growing tissues, this vital culling process is orchestrated through a specific cell-cell interaction called cell competition. In this intricate process, unfit cells, also called “loser”, are eliminated by their surrounding fitter counterparts, the “winner” cells , thereby maintaining tissue health . The best-known example of cell competition is described in the developing Drosophila epithelium using the heterozygous mutations in a ribosomal protein ( Rp ) gene ( also known as Minute ). The Rp+/- flies are viable, however, under mosaic condition the Rp+/- cells are eliminated from the developing epithelium when juxtaposed with the neighboring wild-type ( Rp+/+ ) cells [4–6]. Although the Rp+/- mutation affects cellular physiology autonomously, caspase-dependent apoptosis is observed mostly at the boundary between Rp+/- cells and nearby Rp+/+ cells, which is a hallmark of cell competition . The loser fate of the slow growing Rp+/- cells was suggested to be due to reduced protein translation [8–10]. However, recent studies have shown that Rp+/- cells exhibit high proteotoxic stress [11–14] and activate the expression of bZip transcription factor Xrp-1, which plays an essential role in the elimination of the Rp+/- cells . Interestingly, Xrp-1 appears to be responsible for the manifestation of various defects in Rp+/- cells, including reduced global translation and proteotoxic stress, contributing to the loser status . Moreover, the loser fate is associated with a number of other physiological changes impacting cell fitness. These changes include, 1 ) reduced metabolic activity due to alteration in the mTOR pathway activity , 2 ) loss of apico-basal polarity as a consequence of mutations of the scribble, dlg, and lgl genes , 3 ) defects in endosomal trafficking caused by mutations in the rab5 gene , and 4 ) deregulation of signaling pathways such as Wnt, BMP, and Hippo [22–24].

[ABSTRACT] Loss of function mutations in the checkpoint kinase gene CHEK2 are associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers. Most of the 3, 188 unique amino acid changes that can result from non-synonymous single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) of CHEK2, however, have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHEK2-enocded protein ( CHK2 ). One successful approach to testing the function of variants has been to test for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2, RAD53. This approach has been used to provide functional information on over 100 CHEK2 SNVs and the results align with functional assays in human cells and known pathogenicity. Here we tested all but two of the 4, 887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame for their ability to complement RAD53 mutants using a high throughput technique of deep mutational scanning ( DMS ). Among the non-synonymous changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2, 417 were tolerated. The results correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases. Combined, this approach can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance that are found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes. Cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 ( CHK2 ) is a conserved protein involved in cell cycle control and DNA damage responses. First discovered in 1998 as the mammalian ortholog of Rad53 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CHK2 has established roles in DNA double strand break repair, DNA damage-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest . CHK2 is a 543 amino acid nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that contains three distinct functional domains; an SQ/TQ cluster domain ( SCD ), a forkhead-associated ( FHA ) domain and a kinase domain. When DNA damage occurs, activated ATM phosphorylates CHK2 at T68 [2–4]. This phosphorylation induces dimerization of CHK2 monomers through the binding of the phosphorylated SCD of one CHK2 monomer with the FHA domain of another, initiating autophosphorylation within the kinase domain ( S260, T420 ), the activation loop ( T383, T387 ), and the C-terminus ( S516 ) [5–7]. Activated CHK2 monomers spread the DNA damage signal by phosphorylating downstream protein targets to halt the cell cycle, recruit various proteins to the site of DNA damage, and initiate apoptosis when necessary [1, 8–10]. CHEK2 is a moderately penetrant gene that has been studied for its association with cancer predisposition . Women with the heterozygous founder mutation CHEK2 c. 1100delC, which leads to a protein truncation in the kinase domain, have a 2-3-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer [12–14]. This pathogenic variant has also been associated with increased risk for male breast cancer, gastric, testicular, prostate, and thyroid cancers [15–20].

[ABSTRACT] Human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct intra-populations by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant ( cod ) locus. As manifested by phase switch between opaque and transparent colonies, different genome methylation patterns or epigenomes confer pathogenesis-associated traits, but it is unknown how the pathogen controls the hsdS inversion orientations. Here, we report our finding of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin ( TA ) system that regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions, and thereby bacterial epigenome and associated traits ( e. g., colony opacity ) by targeting pneumococcal protein synthesis. SpxA1 and TenA were found to constitute a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae, primarily based on the observation that overexpressing toxin TenA led to growth arrest in E. coli and enhanced autolysis in S. pneumoniae, and the antitoxin SpxA1 repressed the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon. When the transcription of tenA was de-repressed by a spontaneous AT di-nucleotide insertion/deletion in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, TenA bound to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, and thereby reduced the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX ( known for the activation of natural transformation-associated genes ). Attenuation of ComX expression in turn enhanced the transcription of the invertase gene psrA, which favored the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus. Phenotypically, moderate expression of TenA dramatically reshaped pneumococcal epigenome and colony opacity. Because spontaneous variations frequently occur during bacterial growth in the number of the AT di-nucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, this locus acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity. Streptococcus pneumoniae ( the pneumococcus ) is a commensal in the human nasopharynx and also an opportunistic pathogen of invasive infections ( pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis ) . To adapt to diverse host niches, the bacterium employs complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms to generate phenotypically heterogeneous subpopulations. In particular, S. pneumoniae is capable of reversible phase variation between the opaque ( O ) and transparent ( T ) colony variants within clonal populations . Both phases possess distinct molecular and pathogenic characteristics. The O variants express a thicker capsule with stronger resistance to host phagocytic clearance. In contrast, the T counterparts produce a thinner capsule displaying higher airway adherence [3–6]. These molecular and structural differences are associated with pneumococcal behaviors in animal models. While the O variants are more prevalent in bloodstream infections, the T counterparts are more dominant in nasopharyngeal colonization . Pneumococcal phase variation in colony opacity is epigenetically determined by reversible DNA inversions in the three DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the Spn556II/SpnD39III type I restriction-modification ( R-M ) system or the colony opacity determinant ( cod ) locus [7–9].

[ABSTRACT] High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. However, traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. Contrastive principal component analysis ( cPCA ) has been proposed to address this problem, but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA ( gcPCA ), a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement. We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. As a fast, strong, and easy-to-use comparison method, gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena. Investigators in the biological sciences are increasingly collecting high-dimensional datasets that are challenging to analyze, with modalities ranging from imaging to electrophysiology to single-cell RNA sequencing. Dimensionality reduction algorithms such as principal components analysis ( PCA ) and its many variants [1–5] are used widely to help simplify these datasets and helped analysis. PCA examines the covariance structure of the data to find dimensions that account for more variance than chance; these constitute patterns that are overrepresented in the data, such as assemblies of neurons whose activity fluctuates up and down together across time in a neural recording [6–9], or networks of genes that are up- or down-regulated together across cells in a single-cell RNAseq dataset . However, in many cases, the goal is to compare data collected under two different experimental conditions, which we refer to here as datasets. Since PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques operate on only one dataset, they cannot take experimental conditions into account. The most common approach for comparing two high-dimensional datasets is linear discriminant analysis ( LDA ) or its multidimensional analog, partial least squares discriminant analysis . These methods find dimensions that optimally distinguish one dataset from the other, which could correspond to which neurons fire more, or which genes are upregulated, in condition A vs. condition B. However, an analogous method to compare the covariance structure of two datasets is not as well established.

[ABSTRACT] B cell receptor ( BCR ) signaling is required for the survival and maturation of B cells and is deregulated in B cell lymphomas. While proximal BCR signaling is well studied, little is known about the crosstalk of downstream effector pathways, and a comprehensive quantitative network analysis of BCR signaling is missing. Here, we semi-quantitatively modelled BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data of BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The models unveiled feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of the crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. Compared to the starting network, the trained network for BL-2 cells was better transferable to BL-41 cells. Moreover, the BL-2 network was also suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells lines with aberrant BCR signaling ( HBL-1, OCI-LY3 ), indicating that BCR aberration does not cause a major downstream rewiring. Intracellular signaling pathways are central to the communication of a cell with its environment, and control many important cellular processes and fates. These pathways are often activated by ligands that bind to cognate cell surface receptors and activate a specific set of intracellular proteins, often by tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation. In many disease contexts, these pathways are deregulated, for instance by mutations in key signaling proteins. Consequently, activation can occur independent of ligands or stimuli. Signaling pathways are embedded into complex networks with feedback and crosstalk. It is therefore difficult to predict how these networks change when a pathway is chronically activated, and how the pathway reacts upon targeted interference. Mathematical modeling of intracellular pathways based on systematic perturbation data is a valuable approach to disentangle the difference in signaling networks of ligand/stimuli-induced pathways vs. chronic ( aberrant ) active pathways. A better understanding of the interactions of chronically activated signaling pathways is important to improve the prediction and further design of targeted therapies. B cell receptor signaling represents a network for which the extend of feedback and crosstalk still remains unclear. Furthermore, a better dissection of chronic vs. acute signaling will support our understanding of related diseases. In normal B cells, the pathway is triggered by antigens, but is chronically activated in specific sets of Non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma ( NHL ). In normal physiology the binding of a specific antigen to the B cell receptor complex leads to a very fast rebuilding and recruitment of a number of proximal signaling molecules including the ITAM motif molecules CD79A/B, the kinases LYN/SYK and SLP65/Btk/PI3K [1–3]. The activated BCR then recruits multiple downstream signaling molecules and pathways, some of which include those dependent upon phospholipase Cγ, Protein kinase C or RAF-MAPK, PI3K, GSK3, MTOR and NF-kB. In addition, also JNK and p38MAPK are activated downstream of the BCR .

[ABSTRACT] The ubiquitous Notch receptor signalling network is essential for tissue growth and maintenance. Operationally, receptor activity is regulated by two principal, counterposed mechanisms: intercellular Notch transactivation triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells; intracellular cis inhibition mediated by ligands binding to receptors expressed in the same cell. Moreover, different Notch receptor/ligand combinations are known to elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, and together, these phenomena determine the strength, the duration and the specificity of Notch receptor signalling. To date, it has been assumed that these processes involve discrete ligand homomers and not heteromeric complexes composed of more than one ligand species. In this study, we explore the molecular basis of the opposing actions of the Notch ligands, DLL4 and JAG1, which control angiogenic sprouting. Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, we provide evidence that two mechanisms could underpin this process: 1 ) DLL4 rather than JAG1 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation; 2 ) JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex. We propose a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells, which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis. The ancient and highly conserved Notch receptor signalling pathway is indispensable for embryonic and post-embryonic tissue growth and development . It is formed of large ( approximately 300 kDa ) single pass cell membrane receptors, and ligands which can also be expressed at the cell surface. The overall size, structure and known function of these core receptor/ligand components has remained relatively unchanged over evolutionary time although the number of Notch receptor and ligand family members encoded by different genera varies, for example, invertebrates such as Drosophila possess a single type of Notch receptor controlled by two distinct ligands, whilst vertebrates express up to four distinct receptor paralogues ( Notch1–4 ) and five different ligands: Jagged ( JAG ) 1, JAG2, Delta-Like ( DLL ) 1, DLL3, and DLL4 . Uniquely amongst cell surface receptors, Notch itself can directly activate gene transcription as part of a DNA-bound activation complex, a signal triggered via a trans interaction between the extracellular domain of the receptor and Notch ligands expressed by neighbouring cells. Upon ligand binding, the resultant biomechanical strain/pulling forces cause structural changes which expose specific enzyme cleavage sites in the membrane-proximal region of the receptor [4–8]. then, a defined series of proteolytic events terminates in the γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain , which translocates to the nucleus whereupon it stimulates expression of Notch target genes . An important counterbalance to Notch signalling transactivation is a regulatory process termed cis-inhibition by which ligands block the activity of receptors expressed in the same cell [13–15]. Thus, in this view, the net receptor signalling output is determined by the relative ‘strength’ of these two counterposed processes ( transactivation and cis-inhibition ).

[ABSTRACT] Clustering is widely used in bioinformatics and many other fields, with applications from exploratory analysis to prediction. Many types of data have associated uncertainty or measurement error, but this is rarely used to inform the clustering. We present Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty ( DPMUnc ), an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm which makes use of the uncertainty associated with data points. We show that DPMUnc out-performs existing methods on simulated data. We cluster immune-mediated diseases ( IMD ) using GWAS summary statistics, which have uncertainty linked with the sample size of the study. DPMUnc separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. We additionally consider how DPMUnc can be used to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarised using gene signatures. We first introduce a new procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different to the one where it was discovered, which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual. We summarise three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD, using three relevant gene signatures. We find association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc, with clustering structure replicated across the datasets. The significance of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we demonstrate that when data has associated uncertainty, this uncertainty should be used to inform clustering and we present a method which does this, DPMUnc. Secondly, we present a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were originally defined. We show the value of this procedure by summarising gene expression data from patients with immune-mediated diseases using relevant gene signatures, and clustering these patients using DPMUnc. Grouping items by similarity has a variety of applications in bioinformatics. For example, clustering samples according to any molecular measures may help to identify subgroups of disease . In gene expression data, clustering the genes may be useful for inferring gene function using guilt by association and inferring regulatory relationships . Clustering can also be used to cluster diseases themselves. For example, immune-mediated diseases ( IMD ) have been shown to have a shared genetic basis such that IMD can be clustered according to those shared patterns . Commonly used methods, such as k-means and mclust , assume that the observations being clustered are observed without error, or that any errors are identically distributed. In reality we often have not just data points themselves but also a measure of uncertainty about each observation which has the potential to improve clustering accuracy if exploited. Examples include data generated by multiple uncertain experts , network clustering where edges have an associated score indicating uncertainty, or the cell type annotation problem in single-cell multiomic data, where different omics layers may assign cells to different clusters.

[ABSTRACT] Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful as models of the primate visual system. One crucial problem is that they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision. Whereas humans base their judgements of category membership to a large extent on shape, deep networks rely much more strongly on other features such as color and texture. While this problem has been widely documented, the underlying reasons remain unclear. We design simple, artificial image datasets in which shape, color, and texture features can be used to predict the image class. By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations, we show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features, whereas others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards the other features. We show that the bias can be explained by the interactions between the weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision. Rapid advances in deep learning have created new opportunities to understand brain function [1–5]. Deep neural networks can now be trained to perform tasks like image classification or language generation at a higher level than any other model class and, in sufficiently narrow settings, they can even outperform humans . For neuroscientists who aim to explain how the brain gives rise to behavior, having models that can perform behaviors at this level of complexity is a crucial advantage . In addition, deep neural networks were once inspired by and take their name from the biological neural networks studied by neuroscientists and therefore retain some similarity to the brain: they are made up from simple computational units that are connected in complex ways. Therefore, deep networks can express both mid-level hypotheses about what functions individual units compute and how they have to be connected, and high-level hypotheses about how experience ( in the form of training data and learning rules ) shapes processing . This approach has been remarkably successful, especially in modeling visual processing, where deep networks have been used to predict cortical representations with high accuracy [8–10] and even to generate artificial stimuli to control responses in target neurons . A key criticism of using deep networks as models in neuroscience is that their performance may be deceptive . Even though a deep network may assign similar labels to images as a human participant in an experiment, it may use entirely different mechanisms and strategies to do so. While deep networks share some similarities with visual cortex, the latter makes use of many structural design principles that have not yet been adopted in deep networks, such as feedback connections or lateral grouping .

[ABSTRACT] Hepatic stellate cells ( HSC ) are the source of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases. Understanding the dynamics of HSCs will provide insights needed to develop new therapeutic approaches. Few models of hepatic fibrosis have been proposed, and none of them include the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Here, we developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion. We used the Kappa graph rewriting language, for which we used tokens and counters to overcome temporal explosion. HSCs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and that interact with ( TGFβ1 ) molecules which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen, the main component of the ECM. Simulation studies revealed the critical role of the HSC inactivation process during fibrosis progression and reversion. While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps, reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs ( iHSCs ) are required to sustain fibrosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the model’s sensitivity to ( TGFβ1 ) parameters, suggesting its adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions for which levels of ( TGFβ1 ) production associated with the inflammatory response differ. Using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, we validated the predicted ECM dynamics. Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as new markers of fibrosis progression. Overall, our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis. Moreover, our model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues. Liver fibrosis is an excessive wound healing response induced by chronic injuries, mainly caused by viral hepatitis ( HCV, HBV ), alcohol abuse and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ). Fibrosis is characterized by an accumulation of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) which increases the stiffness of tissues, leading to severe liver dysfunction. The final stage of fibrosis, cirrhosis, leads to complications such as ascites, variceal hemorrhage, encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is associated with a high mortality rate worldwide . Activation of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) is the main process underlying hepatic fibrosis . In a normal liver, HSCs are quiescent, store vitamin A and are located in the Disse space between hepatocytes and endothelial cells that delineate sinusoids. Upon liver injury, HSCs are activated and transdifferentiate into ECM-secreting myofibroblasts ( MFB ) that contribute to tissue repair. In chronic liver disease, the inflammatory signal persists, leading to sustained HSC activation, ECM accumulation and fibrosis [2–4].

[ABSTRACT] Meta-analysis is used to aggregate the effects of interest across multiple studies, while its methodology is largely underexplored in mediation analysis, particularly in estimating the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators. Large-scale genomic consortia, such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) program, comprise multiple cohorts with diverse technologies to explained the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits and diseases. Leveraging the recent established asymptotic standard error of the R-squared ( R2 ) -based mediation effect estimation for high-dimensional omics mediators, we have developed a new meta-analysis framework requiring only summary statistics and allowing inter-study heterogeneity. Whereas the proposed meta-analysis can uniquely evaluate and account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to, for example, varying genomic profiling platforms, our extensive simulations showed that the developed method was more computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to analysis of the pooled individual-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity. We applied the developed method to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol. The proposed method is available in R package MetaR2M on GitHub. Large-scale genomic consortia and biobanks have helped genetic and genomic research by providing data and tools to probe into complex human diseases and traits with unparalleled depth and applicability [1–3]. For instance, in our motivating example, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s ( NHLBI ) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) project brings together over 85 cohorts consisting of more than 180, 000 participants using various high-throughput profiling technologies to explained the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits . Advances in technology and data sharing have made individual participant data more accessible . However, the acquisition and analysis of such individual-level data is time-consuming, financially demanding, and limited by privacy concerns. High-dimensional mediation analysis is a crucial analytical approach focused on evaluating the mediating role of molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression, in the relationship between environmental exposure/risk factor and health outcomes [7–12]. A variance-based R-squared measure, denoted as R M e d 2, was proposed to estimate the total mediation effect in the high-dimensional setting . A recently developed two-stage cross-fitted interval estimation procedure for R M e d 2 enables the implementation of meta-analysis in mediation analysis due to its availability of asymptotic standard error and computational efficiency , as to be pursued here. Meta-analysis is a powerful tool for synthesizing the effects of interest across multiple similar individual studies . Established meta-analysis techniques use summary statistics to resolve the difficulties in accessing individual-level data [18–22]. Fixed-effects meta-analysis stands out as the most widely-used and strong method for combining findings from multiple genetic studies . Fixed-effects models require the assumption that the true effects of interest are identical across all studies.

[ABSTRACT] Cancer development is driven by an accumulation of a small number of driver genetic mutations that confer the selective growth advantage to the cell, while most passenger mutations do not contribute to tumor progression. The identification of these driver genes responsible for tumorigenesis is a crucial step in designing effective cancer treatments. Although many computational methods have been developed with this purpose, the majority of existing methods solely provided a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients, ignoring the high heterogeneity of driver events across patients. It remains challenging to identify the personalized driver genes. Here, we propose a new method ( PDRWH ), which aims to prioritize the mutated genes of a single patient based on their impact on the abnormal expression of downstream genes across a group of patients who share the co-mutation genes and similar gene expression profiles. The wide experimental results on 16 cancer datasets from TCGA showed that PDRWH excels in identifying known general driver genes and tumor-specific drivers. In the comparative testing across five cancer types, PDRWH outperformed existing individual-level methods as well as cohort-level methods. Our results also demonstrated that PDRWH could identify both common and rare drivers. The personalized driver profiles could improve tumor stratification, providing new insights into understanding tumor heterogeneity and taking a further step toward personalized treatment. We also validated one of our predicted new personalized driver genes on tumor cell proliferation by vitro cell-based assays, the promoting effect of the high expression of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 ( LRP1 ) on tumor cell proliferation. Cancer is a collection of genetic diseases characterized by abnormal and uncontrolled cellular growth, which are primarily caused by the accumulation of genetic alterations [1–3]. Previous evidence has shown that a small fraction of genomic and transcriptomic altered genes, called cancer driver genes, could modify transcriptional programs and result in abnormal cell proliferation and eventually tumorigenesis [4–6]. The majority of detected altered genes are passengers that do not contribute to the oncogenic process. Distinguishing cancer driver genes from numerous functionally neutral passenger mutation genes is critical for providing clinically characterized insights into tumor biology. And it has led to the development of a model of targeted anticancer therapies, and the search for biomarkers of prognosis and response to cancer treatments [7–9]. With recent advances in genomics technologies, comprehensive platforms such as the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ), have led to the characterization of the molecular signatures of human cancers spanning 33 cancer types, providing an unprecedented opportunity to develop computational methods for driver gene identification . Many bioinformatics tools are dedicated to identifying driver mutations from passengers in a cohort of patients [11–15]. However, since cancer patients possess different genomes and their disease might be driven by different driver genes , it is necessary to investigate personalized cancer drivers specific to an individual patient.

[ABSTRACT] The Virtual Epileptic Patient ( VEP ) refers to a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities. It is capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG data, allowing for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery. This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach. The approach utilizes SaCeSS, a cooperative metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation, to yield high-quality solutions without requiring excessive computational time. Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic data, our proposal successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating better scalability and superior performance against other parallel solvers. These results were further enhanced using a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning, with significant gains in terms of both accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, we added a scalable uncertainty quantification phase after model calibration, and used it to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems. Overall, this study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, thereby to inform the clinical decision-making process. Achieving maximum accuracy in predictive modeling poses a significant challenge in inferring critical information from recording data, such as characterizing pathological brain networks from ( stereoelectro ) EEG data. Optimizing parameters efficiently is therefore essential for gaining insights into underlying mechanisms of the data-generating process in pathological conditions, such as the dynamics and connectivity of abnormal brain networks. The quantitative approaches have accompanied a major conceptual and theoretical evolution in epilepsy surgery, moving beyond the concept of an epileptogenic focus and proposing several definitions of different zones ( e. g., the epileptogenic zone, the seizure onset zone, and the irritative zone [1–5] ). In partial epilepsy, seizures originate from a network of hyperexcitable regions referred to as the epileptogenic zone ( EZ; ) and then propagate to a secondary connected network, the so-called propagation zone ( PZ; ). However, defining the EZ based on stereoelectro EEG ( SEEG ) can be difficult, as the patterns of seizure onset and early spread may exhibit complex organization, influenced by network dynamics . For instance, it has been reported that the seizure onset zone ( SOZ ) is not always a good marker of the EZ . Given that epileptogenic regions often originate beyond a single epileptic focus, a network of brain regions that is necessary and sufficient for initiation of seizures, the removal of which guarantees the complete abolition of seizures . In this study focusing on model-based inference using in-silico data, we assume that the EZ is equivalent to the SOZ. Nevertheless, the success of surgical interventions for drug-resistant patients critically depends on the precision and reliability of the initial hypotheses, e. g., the spatial map of EZ/PZ as an identification of the seizure organization [5, 10–15].

[ABSTRACT] Tuberculosis ( TB ), the disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), remains a major health problem with 10. 6 million cases of the disease and 1. 6 million deaths in 2021. It is well understood that pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung but quantitative estimates of rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of patients or animals such as monkeys or rabbits remain largely unknown. We performed experiments with rabbits infected with a new, virulent clinical Mtb isolate of the Beijing lineage, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10. In our in vitro experiments we found that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 strain than in a more commonly used laboratory-adapted Mtb strain H37Rv ( the segregation coefficient being s = 0. 10 in HN878 vs. s = 0. 18 in H37Rv ). Interestingly, the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in lungs of Mtb-infected rabbits did not follow an expected monotonic decline; the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points. Mathematical modeling suggested that such a non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells can be explained if the lung Mtb population consists of several ( at least 2 ) sub-populations with different replication/death kinetics: one major population expanding early and being controlled/eliminated, while another, a smaller population expanding at later times causing a counterintuitive increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells. Importantly, a model with one kinetically homogeneous Mtb population could not explain the data including when the model was run stochastically. Given that in rabbits HN878 strain forms well circumscribed granulomas, our results suggest independent bacterial dynamics in subsets of such granulomas. Our model predictions can be tested in future experiments in which HN878-pBP10 dynamics in individual granulomas is followed over time. Taken together, our new data and mathematical modeling-based analyses illustrate differences in Mtb dynamics in mice and rabbits confirming a perhaps somewhat obvious observation that “rabbits are not mice”. Tuberculosis ( TB ), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), remains a global health threat. In 2021, 1. 6 million people died due to TB despite available effective chemotherapy . The infection with Mtb results in heterogeneity of disease outcomes such as bacterial clearance, bacterial persistence, and active disease with and without lung cavitation [2–4]. Several studies suggested that between quarter to a third of the world’s population has evidence of Mtb infection . While most are not at risk to develop active disease, individuals who do progress to TB seem to do so within 1–2 years after exposure . Studying TB progression in humans is difficult as most exposed individuals do not develop the disease, and thus, it requires dedicated long-term cohort studies ( e. g., ).

[ABSTRACT] Carbohydrates and glycoproteins modulate key biological functions. However, experimental structure determination of sugar polymers is notoriously difficult. Computational approaches can aid in carbohydrate structure prediction, structure determination, and design. In this work, we developed a glycan-modeling algorithm, GlycanTreeModeler, that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer, using adaptive kernel density estimates ( KDE ) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) and from quantum mechanics ( QM ) calculations. GlycanTreeModeler was benchmarked on a test set of glycan structures of varying lengths, or “trees”. Structures predicted by GlycanTreeModeler agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both de novo modeling and experimental density-guided building. We employed these tools to design de novo glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition, and experimentally verified shielding. This work will inform glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and further aid computational methods in experimental structure determination and refinement. Carbohydrates and glycoproteins are ubiquitous in biological organisms . Viral glycoproteins such as HIV envelope trimer, influenza hemagglutinin, and SARS-CoV-2 spike, employ N-linked glycosylation as an immune evasion strategy, taking advantage of the fact that host glycans on the surface of proteins are usually recognized as “self” by the adaptive immune system . Yet, HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies often target glycans as part of their epitopes . Small carbohydrate residues attached to serine or threonine can act in signaling pathways akin to phosphorylation , while glycans on the constant region of antibodies act as mediators of effector function . Glycans can also improve stability and solubility , reduce aggregation , and even improve biological drug-targeting and vaccine design through glycan masking of off-target regions . However, in the context of a series of protein nanoparticle immunogens, we recently discovered that glycan masking of the protein nanoparticle scaffold itself is unlikely to enhance antigen-specific antibody responses, especially when the displayed antigen is immunodominant over the nanoparticle scaffold . But we also recently showed that high-density and high-mannose glycans on protein nanoparticle surfaces increase lymph node trafficking and antibody responses against the nanoparticle in a density- and mannose-dependent manner . Thus, optimizing the density and composition of glycans displayed on protein-based vaccines—either on the antigen and/or protein nanoparticle scaffold—provides a framework for engineering glycan recognition to optimize vaccine efficacy. The biosynthesis of glycoconjugates is complex. Carbohydrates can be attached to certain amino acid residues including serine, threonine, asparagine, and ( rarely ) tryptophan through covalent modification, forming glycoproteins. The attachment can be made to nitrogen, oxygen, or carbon atoms, ( known as N-, O-, or C-linked glycosylation, respectively ), with each process involving a multitude of enzymes, sugar moieties and resulting carbohydrate structures. These processes are stochastic in nature, producing glycoproteins that are heterogeneous in both the occupancy of a glycan at the glycosylation site ( macro-heterogenicity ) and the chemical makeup of the N-, C-, or O-linked glycan ( micro-heterogenicity ) .

[ABSTRACT] Protein ubiquitination is usually coupled with proteasomal degradation and is crucial in regulating protein quality. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF ( Skp1-Cullin-F-box ) complex directly recognizes the target substrate via interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate. F-box protein is the determinant of substrate specificity. The limited number of identified ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitination field. Penicillium oxalicum contains many transcription factors, such as BrlA, CreA, XlnR, and Ace1, conserved in filamentous fungi that regulate the fungal development and transcription of ( hemi ) cellulase genes. Transcription factor Ace1 ( also known as SltA ) positively correlated with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively correlated with the expression of ( hemi ) cellulase genes. A ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFFbx23-Ace1, is identified in P. oxalicum. Most of PoFbx23 is present in free form within the nucleus. A small portion of PoFbx23 associates with Skp1 to form PoFbx23-Skp1 heterodimer or assembles with the three invariable core components ( Skp1, Cul1, and Rbx1 ) of SCF to form the SCFFbx23 complex. Under glucose signal, PoFbx23 absence ( Δfbx23 ) results in decreased transcription levels of the brlA gene which encodes the master regulator for asexual development and six spore pigmentation genes ( abrB→abrA→aygB→arpA→arpB→albA ) which encode the proteins in the dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin pathway, along with impaired conidiation. Under cellulose signal, transcription levels of ( hemi ) cellulase genes in the Δfbx23 mutant are significantly upregulated. When PoFbx23 is present, PoAce1 exists as a full-length version and several low-molecular-weight degraded versions. PoAce1 has polyubiquitin modification. Deleting the Pofbx23 gene does not affect Poace1 gene transcription but results in the remarkable accumulation of all versions of the PoAce1 protein. Accumulated PoAce1 protein is a dysfunctional form that no longer binds promoters of the target gene, including the cellulase genes cbh1 and eg1, the hemicellulase gene xyn11A, and the pigmentation-related gene abrB. PoFbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator, recognizing and activating PoAce1, allowing the latter to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects ( activating or repressing ) under different signals. Post-translational modifications of proteins play versatile roles in protein functions ranging from protein degradation to subcellular localization, conformation change, and protein affinity with DNA motifs . Protein ubiquitination is usually coupled with proteasomal degradation, forming a ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS ), which plays an essential role in the cellular processes for protein quality control. Protein quality control can occur in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, or nucleus . Within the nucleus, UPS is related to DNA replication, repair, maintaining genome integrity, and regulating gene expression . The ubiquitination of proteins is a three-step enzymatic cascade that involves the ubiquitin-activating enzyme ( E1 ), the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ( E2 ), and the ubiquitin-protein ligase ( E3 ) —this cascade results in the transfer of ubiquitin onto the substrate. E3 ubiquitin ligases, which directly recognize protein substrates, are the primary determinants of the specificity of protein ubiquitylation .

[ABSTRACT] The basement membrane ( BM ) is an essential structural element of tissues, and its diversification participates in organ morphogenesis. However, the traffic routes associated with BM formation and the mechanistic modulations explaining its diversification are still poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium relies on a BM composed of oriented BM fibrils and a more homogenous matrix. Here, we determined the specific molecular identity and cell exit sites of BM protein secretory routes. First, we found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM protein secretion. When both routes were abolished, BM production was fully blocked; however, genetic interactions revealed that these two routes competed. Rab10 promoted lateral and planar-polarized secretion, whereas Rab8 promoted basal secretion, leading to the formation of BM fibrils and homogenous BM, respectively. We also found that the dystrophin-associated protein complex ( DAPC ) and Rab10 were both present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DAPC was essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route. Moreover, we identified a dual function for the exocyst complex in this context. First, the Exo70 subunit directly interacted with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization. Second, the exocyst complex was also required for the Rab8 route. Altogether, these results highlight important mechanistic aspects of BM protein secretion and illustrate how BM diversity can emerge from the spatial control of distinct traffic routes. Basement membrane ( BM ) is a specialized extracellular matrix forming a complex sheet-like architectural meshwork that lines most of animal tissues, such as epithelium and muscle . BM is critical for tissue development, homeostasis and regeneration, as exemplified in humans by its implication in many congenital and chronic disorders . Therefore, understanding its properties is a major issue for regenerative medicine . BM is assembled from core components conserved throughout evolution: type IV collagen ( Col IV ), the heparan-sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, and the glycoproteins laminin and nidogen . During development, the dynamic interplay between cells and BM participates in sculpting organs and maintaining their shape [1, 6–8]. Specifically, BM influences essential cellular processes ( e. g. cell identity, growth, shape, and migration ) through various cell surface receptors, such as integrins [5–7, 9–11]. Reciprocally, cells constantly produce and remodel their BM, thus modifying their mechanical and biochemical microenvironment . BM protein secretion may involve specific proteins, mainly because of the large size of the protein complexes ( e. g. procollagen ) that must transit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface . This transport is well understood from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus . However, much less is known on how these BM proteins reach the cell surface and how these routes are spatiotemporally integrated in a developing tissue. Our understanding of BM biology has been broadened by studies in invertebrates that revealed, using fluorescent tagged versions of BM components, the unexpected diversity of BM structures and dynamics .

[ABSTRACT] The ability to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs ) will increase bnAb therapeutic benefits. Machine learning is a powerful approach for such prediction. One challenge is that some HIV-1 subtypes in currently available training datasets are underrepresented, which likely affects models’ generalizability across subtypes. A second challenge is that combinations of bnAbs are required to avoid the inevitable resistance to a single bnAb, and computationally determining optimal combinations of bnAbs is an unsolved problem. Recently, machine learning models trained using resistance outcomes for multiple antibodies at once, a strategy called multi-task learning ( MTL ), have been shown to improve predictions. We develop a new model and show that, beyond the boost in performance, MTL also helps address the previous two challenges. Specifically, we demonstrate empirically that MTL can mitigate bias from underrepresented subtypes, and that MTL allows the model to learn patterns of co-resistance to combinations of antibodies, thus providing tools to predict antibodies’ epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations. Our analyses, publicly available at https://github. com/iaime/LBUM, can be adapted to other infectious diseases that are treated with antibody therapy. Broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs ) exhibiting exceptional breadth and potency have revived the hope for their use in immunotherapy to prevent and to treat HIV-1 . To neutralize most viruses and to prevent viral escape, bnAbs will likely be given in combinations. For example, in two separate phase 1b clinical trials, the combination of 3BNC117 and 10–1074 achieved viral suppression for roughly 20 weeks without antiretroviral therapy in 9 out of 11 individuals ( pre-selected for antibody sensitivity ), and in 13 out of 17 individuals ( not pre-selected for antibody sensitivity ), respectively . Nonetheless, the general question of which bnAbs to administer together to achieve maximum efficacy is still outstanding. Given that bnAbs target HIV’s envelope glycoprotein ( Env ), neutralization assays are traditionally used to determine the breadth and potency of different bnAbs against panels of Env-pseudotyped viruses . For each pseudovirus, these experiments determine the bnAb concentration needed to reduce infectivity by 50% or 80% ( i. e., IC50 or IC80, respectively ). These assays are expensive and slow. In particular, when the goal is to identify bnAbs that are likely to neutralize most viruses in a given population, there is the need for scalable computational methods to predict Env sequences’ sensitivity to bnAbs. Several machine learning ( ML ) models [5–12] that map Env sequences to bnAb susceptibility have been developed using neutralization data compiled in CATNAP . The generalizability of these methods beyond the training data is unclear, as the training datasets have HIV-1 subtype compositions that are unrepresentative of large epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa ( S1 Fig ) , where the two thirds of people living with HIV-1 worldwide reside . This is particularly worrying since susceptibility to bnAbs can be subtype-dependent .

[ABSTRACT] Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a hematological disease exhibiting aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for informed therapeutic decision-making. Most previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that the dysfunction of the pathway is closely associated with disease development and progression. The present study considered two strategies that construct predictive models by taking pathway information into consideration: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. The former simply converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for model fitting. We considered three methods for pathway score calculation ( ssGSEA, GSVA, and z-scores ) and 14 data sources providing pathway information. We implemented these methods in microarray data for MM and obtained a candidate model with the best prediction performance in interval validation. The candidate model is further compared with the gene-based model and previously published models in two external data. We also investigated the effects of missing values on prediction. The results showed that group lasso incorporating Vax pathway information ( Vax ( grp ) ) was more competitive in prediction than the gene model in both internal and external validation. Immune information, including VAX pathways, seemed to be more predictive for MM. Vax ( grp ) also outperformed the previously published models. Moreover, the new model was more resistant to missing values, and the presence of missing values ( <5% ) would not evidently deteriorate its prediction accuracy using our missing data imputation method. In a nutshell, pathway-based models ( using group lasso ) were competitive alternatives to gene-based models for MM.

Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a hematological disease exhibiting aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in bone marrow [1–3].

[ABSTRACT] Mitochondrial hyperfission in response to cellular insult is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the molecular mechanisms coordinating and regulating the complex process of mitochondrial fission. We develop a nonlinear dynamical systems model of dynamin related protein one ( Drp1 ) -dependent mitochondrial fission and use it to identify parameters which can regulate the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time. The TFR defined from a nondimensionalization of the model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k - where M is the total concentration of mitochondrial fission factor ( Mff ) and k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The variable μ can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers. Though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters, we found the TFR and the cumulative total fission ( TF ) depend strongly on only one, μ. Interestingly, the cumulative TF does not monotonically increase as μ increases. Instead it increases with μ to a certain point and then begins to decrease as μ continues to increase. This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests interventions targeting k+, k−, or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission process. Thus understanding the impact of regulatory parameters, such as μ, may assist future therapeutic target selection. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that maintain a steady-state through three general processes: mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics ( fission and fusion ) [1–6]. Upon acute stress, mitochondria can undergo hyperfission resulting in an increase in fragmentation, which shifts their size distribution . These fragmented mitochondria have decreased ATP production, decreased oxygen consumption, increased reactive oxygen species production, and an increased susceptibility to programmed cell death . Moreover, inhibition of mitochondrial hyperfission can blunt the impact of cellular injury. In cardiomyocyte-like HL1 cells, through the inhibition of fission signaling ( including cyclin dependent kinases Cdk 1, 2 and 5 ), roscovitine protects cells from ischemia/reperfusion injury in vitro . Further in vivo studies in rats demonstrate that inhibiting hyperfission in early stages of ischemia protect against long-term ischemic injury including a decrease in infarct size and improvement in function . In male mice, studies demonstrate inhibition of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission by the outer mitochondrial AKAP1/PKA complex protects neurons from ischemic stroke . However, deletion of key mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins ( Mff or Drp1 ) results in heart failure . Disruptions in the balance between fission and fusion has also been observed to affect normal development, and these disruptions have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases indicating that a balance between fission and fusion is crucial to cell health across diverse cell types. Drp1 is a key player in mitochondrial fission through its interaction with the outer mitochondrial membrane ( OMM ) [13–17].

[ABSTRACT] CRISPR-based gene drives offer promising prospects for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. A significant challenge for successful suppression-type drive is the rapid evolution of resistance alleles. One approach to mitigate the development of resistance involves targeting functionally constrained regions using multiple gRNAs. In this study, we constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( Tdc2 ) in Drosophila suzukii, a notorious fruit pest. Our investigation revealed only a low level of homing in the germline, but feeding octopamine restored the egg-laying defects in Tdc2 mutant females, allowing easier line maintenance than for other suppression drive targets. We tested the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. Our findings show that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles, and the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive, offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects. Gene drive is a new genetic engineering tool for controlling disease transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. Specifically, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene drive has broad application prospects due to its high specificity and flexibility. It functions by biasing the inheritance of specific genes to ensure their widespread transmission across successive generations. Current CRISPR-based gene drives consist of three key components: a Cas9 endonuclease gene, one or multiple gRNAs, and a marker gene. Once the target site on a homologous chromosome is cleaved, the gene-drive element is inserted into the double-stranded break ( DSB ) through homology-directed repair ( HDR ), utilizing the drive-bearing homologous chromosome as a template for repair . If this process of directional gene conversion, also known as homing, is highly efficient, the drive allele will be inherited in a manner that surpasses typical Mendelian inheritance patterns ( >50% ). Under ideal conditions, the gene drive elements will eventually spread throughout the population. In fact, Anopheles mosquitoes engineered with CRISPR-based gene-drive have achieved close to 100% inheritance of the desired allele across successive generations . However, the emergence of resistance alleles through end-joining can inhibit the drive, blocking recognition by the gRNAs and potentially maintaining gene function [3–6]. It should be noted that in this research we use the term ""resistance"" broadly refer to alleles formed by end-joining repair, causing mutations that prevent their cleavage by the drive. In some lab experiments, resistance to CRISPR/Cas9-based homing drives arise rapidly, especially when using a single gRNA . Thus, a homing suppression drive targeting a female fertility gene can slow down the development of resistance alleles because any sequence alternation, including in-frame indels, would incur substantial fitness costs .

[ABSTRACT] The brain is not only constrained by energy needed to fuel computation, but it is also constrained by energy needed to form memories. Experiments have shown that learning simple conditioning tasks which might require only a few synaptic updates, already carries a significant metabolic cost. Yet, learning a task like MNIST to 95% accuracy appears to require at least 108 synaptic updates. Therefore the brain has likely evolved to be able to learn using as little energy as possible. We explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks. Based on a parsimonious energy model, we propose two plasticity restricting algorithms that save energy: 1 ) only modify synapses with large updates, and 2 ) restrict plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. In biology networks are often much larger than the task requires, yet vanilla backprop prescribes to update all synapses. In particular in this case, large savings can be achieved while only incurring a slightly worse learning time. Thus competitively restricting plasticity helps to save metabolic energy associated to synaptic plasticity. The results might lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a better match between artificial and biological learning. Moreover, the algorithms might benefit hardware because also electronic memory storage is energetically costly. Energy availability is a vital necessity for biological organisms. The nervous system is a particularly intensive energy consumer. Though it constitutes approximately 2% of human body mass, it is responsible for roughly 20% of basal metabolism—continuously consuming some 20W . Energy requirements of neural signaling are now widely seen as an important design constraint of the brain. Sparse codes and sparse connectivity ( pruning ) can be used to lower energy requirements . Learning rules have been designed that yield energy efficient networks . However, learning itself is also energetically costly: in classical conditioning experiments with flies the formation of long-term memory reduced lifespan by 20% when the flies were then starved . Moreover, starving fruit flies halt long-term memory formation; nevertheless forcing memory expression reduced their lifespan . We have estimated the cost of learning in fruitflies at 10mJ/bit . These costs are not restricted to flies. In mammals there is physiological evidence that energy availability gates long lasting forms of plasticity . Furthermore, in humans there is behavioral evidence for a correlation between metabolism and memory . Given this evidence, we hypothesize that biological neural plasticity is designed to be energy efficient. Including energy constraints could lead to computational learning rules more closely resembling biology, and a better understanding of observed synaptic plasticity rules. As precise metabolic cost models for plasticity are not yet available, we aim at algorithmic principles rather than energy efficient biophysical mechanisms. We introduce an abstract energy measure that assumes the energy is solely used by the synaptic updates. Costs for synaptic transmission and global costs independent of the number of synapses are ignored ( see Discussion ).

[ABSTRACT] Organelles and endosymbionts have naturally evolved dramatically reduced genome sizes compared to their free-living ancestors. Synthetic biologists have purposefully engineered streamlined microbial genomes to create more efficient cellular chassis and define the minimal components of cellular life. During natural or engineered genome streamlining, deletion of many non-essential genes in combination often reduces bacterial fitness for idiosyncratic or unknown reasons. We investigated how and to what extent laboratory evolution could overcome these defects in six variants of the transposon-free Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx that each had a deletion of a different 22- to 42-kilobase region and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases. We evolved replicate populations of ADP1-ISx and each deletion strain for ~300 generations in a chemically defined minimal medium or a complex medium and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates. Fitness increased in all cases that were examined except for two ancestors that each failed to improve in one of the two environments. Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors. The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd ( ribonuclease D ), csrA ( RNA-binding carbon storage regulator ), and hfq ( RNA-binding protein and chaperone ) were frequently mutated across all strains, though the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment. Mutations in this regulatory network likely compensate for how an earlier deletion of a transposon in the ADP1-ISx ancestor of all the deletion strains restored csrA function. More generally, our results demonstrate that fitness lost during genome streamlining can usually be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution and that recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments. Genome streamlining is a process of genome reduction in which unnecessary or detrimental genes are lost or removed, resulting in a simpler genome. Gene loss occurs naturally in many microorganisms, including symbionts and pathogens , that live in stable, nutrient-rich environments where genes encoding ancillary metabolic pathways are unnecessary. However, little is known about the detailed dynamics of natural streamlining, as most of our understanding of genome reduction comes from comparing the very different genomes of endosymbionts and their free-living relatives . Two types of approaches have been used to experimentally study genome streamlining [4–7]. Top-down approaches are similar to natural processes in that they start with a free-living organism and sequentially delete non-essential pieces of its genome. This procedure has achieved various degrees of genome reduction in many bacterial and fungal species, including deleting up to 38. 9% of the Escherichia coli genome . The other approach, bottom-up design, assembles the DNA for a minimal chromosome de novo and then inserts it into a recipient cell to produce a synthetic organism.

[ABSTRACT] Precise regulation of gene expression is essential to understand a wide range of biological processes. Control over gene expression can be achieved using site-directed recombinases and endonucleases. However, their efficiency is variable and dependent on the genomic context. Here, we develop a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebrafish. Using an in vivo reporter strategy, we first show that inserting the T3H48 self-cleaving ribozyme in an intron enables rapid pre-mRNA cleavage, with up to 20-fold reduction in expression, and that this ribozyme displays superior activity compared with other ribozymes. We then inserted the T3H48 ribozyme in the second intron of the albino gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and observed a pigmentation phenotype similar to that in the mutant. Using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme, we also show that this phenotype is reversible, illustrating the specificity of the approach. In addition, we generated a Flippase- and Cre-activatable version of the T3H48 ribozyme, called RiboFlip, to control the mRNA levels of the albino gene. RiboFlip activation induced mRNA knockdown and also recapitulated the albino mutant phenotype. Furthermore, we show that a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter in the RiboFlip cassette can label knocked-down cells independently of the expression of the target gene. Altogether, we introduce the RiboFlip cassette as a flexible tool to control endogenous gene expression in a vertebrate model and as an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies. Modulating RNA and protein expression using genetic tools is essential to understand their function in vivo . Spatiotemporal control of gene knockout has become the standard approach in vertebrate model organisms to investigate RNA and protein function. Multiple site-directed tools are available to control gene knockout, including recombinase systems such as Cre/LOX, Flp/FRT, and Dre/ROX, as well as endonuclease-mediated CRISPR editing . However, these systems are not available in all vertebrate models, are challenging to implement, and display variable efficiency depending on the genomic context. Hence, more flexible approaches are needed to control gene expression. The synthetic biology field has contributed several tools to regulate RNA stability . One promising family of RNA regulatory elements consists of self-cleaving ribozymes, which are short RNA structures capable of catalyzing their own cleavage . When inserted in a protein-coding gene, this cleavage leads to RNA degradation and a reduction in protein levels. This approach has been used to modulate transgene stability in multiple models, including human and mouse cells [6–9], C. elegans , Drosophila , and Plasmodium . One limitation to efficient RNA degradation is the slow cleavage kinetics, which makes most natural self-cleaving ribozymes unsuitable for in vivo applications. To circumvent this issue, an artificial Schistosoma mansoni hammerhead ribozyme, called T3H48, which displays a dramatic increase in cleavage rate has recently been engineered . This ribozyme, as well as related ones , have been used to control transgene expression using Cre- and Flp-recombinases .

[ABSTRACT] Segmentation is required to quantify cellular structures in microscopic images. This typically requires their fluorescent labeling. Convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) can detect these structures also in only transmitted light images. This eliminates the need for transgenic or dye fluorescent labeling, frees up imaging channels, reduces phototoxicity and speeds up imaging. However, this approach currently requires optimized experimental conditions and computational specialists. Here, we introduce “aiSEGcell” a user-friendly CNN-based software to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images. We extensively evaluated it for nucleus segmentation in different primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities in hand-curated published and new imaging data sets. We provide this curated ground-truth data with 1. 1 million nuclei in 20, 000 images. aiSEGcell accurately segments nuclei from even challenging bright field images, very similar to manual segmentation. It retains biologically relevant information, e. g. for demanding quantification of noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics. aiSEGcell is readily adaptable to new use cases with only 32 images required for retraining. aiSEGcell is accessible through both a command line, and a napari graphical user interface. It is agnostic to computational environments and does not require user expert coding experience. Image segmentation—the partitioning of an image into meaningful segments—is fundamental to image analysis. It is usually the first step in image analysis pipelines to identify tissues, cells or subcellular structures to then allow their state quantification or tracking and dynamics quantification . Accurate segmentation is usually crucial for strong automated downstream analyses . While manual image segmentation is considered the gold standard, segmentation for high throughput microscopy requires computer assistance. Conventional computer-assisted image segmentation is semi-automated and necessitates good signal-to-noise, using a dedicated fluorescence channel for segmenting cells, nuclei, or other targets [3–5]. However, dedicating a fluorescence channel to helped image segmentation loses a channel that would otherwise be available to image other relevant targets and increases imaging phototoxicity and required acquisition times . Furthermore, adding a transgenic fluorescence marker increases the size of genetic constructs, complicates experimentation and reduces virus packaging and transduction efficiency . Similarly, the time and cost associated with establishing and maintaining a transgenic animal line increases considerably with each additional transgene. Eliminating the need for fluorescent markers for segmenting cellular structures would thus greatly improve imaging experiments. This is made possible by segmenting cells and their compartments in transmitted light images. Albeit visible in transmitted light images, features indicative of even a large organelle like the nucleus are complex, vary between cell types, and over time, for example due to cell differentiation, cell movement or changes in the focal plane. Neural networks excel at discovering complex informative features and are not limited to specific imaging conditions or cell types if trained on a large representative data set [8–11]. Previous research has shown that neural networks can automatically detect nuclei and other sub-cellular structures in high magnification bright field ( BF ) images .

[ABSTRACT] Identifying goal-relevant features in new environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour. We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. Across two experiments and one preregistered replication, participants accrued more reward when a bandit’s relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. We did not find a difference in the ability to generalise to unseen feature values between conditions. Testing how feature speed could affect learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants’ performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning. A remarkable amount of information is reaching our senses at any given time, yet often only a small subset of it is relevant to our current goal. Determining which aspects of our environment are relevant is therefore a crucial challenge for learning goal-directed behaviour. But addressing this challenge is hard. The space of possibilities is often too large to be explored fully within the time limits we need to consider, and yet limiting attention to only a subset of features risks ignoring relevant information . One approach to this problem is to not learn every problem anew, but instead use knowledge of properties that have been relevant in the past as a starting point, in the form of so-called priors, also known as inductive biases [3–7]. Here, we study the role of one such prior in human learning, namely a bias to focus learning on slowly changing features in our environments, and their potential association to rewards. Analogous to the concept of a ‘prior’ in Bayesian statistics, priors are pre-existing beliefs about the underlying structure of an environment, based on generalised past experiences or evolutionary transmission . Previous research has shown that priors can expedite the learning process by focusing information processing on what is common across many environments .

[ABSTRACT] Patients with ER-negative breast cancer have the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes, often experiencing rapid recurrence or progression to metastatic disease shortly after diagnosis. Given that metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors, understanding metastatic biology is crucial for effective intervention. Using a mouse systems genetics approach, we previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility. Here, we extend those studies to identify Resf1, a poorly characterized gene, as a new metastasis susceptibility gene in ER- breast cancer. Resf1 is a large, unstructured protein with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure, but with poor amino acid conservation. CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed to the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model ( MMTV-PyMT ) demonstrated that reduction of Resf1 resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth, a shortened overall survival time, and increased incidence and number of lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Furthermore, an analysis of matched tail and primary tissues revealed loss of the wildtype copy in tumor tissue, consistent with Resf1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Resf1 in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis. These results suggest that loss of Resf1 enhances tumor progression in ER- breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the United States . As the primary tumor is typically surgically removed upon detection, most of these deaths result from the effects of metastatic disease. This is best highlighted by the fact that the current five-year survival rate of patients with localized disease is approximately 90%, but drops to 31% when patients develop distant metastatic disease . Thus, there is a critical need for therapies that can effectively prevent metastasis and/or treat established metastatic tumors. To improve patient outcomes, it is essential to identify bottlenecks and vulnerabilities within the metastatic cascade and in established secondary tumors. Addressing these factors is crucial for preventing or eliminating the lesions that are the proximal cause of most breast cancer-associated morbidity and mortality. Despite considerable advances in our understanding of the cellular biology of metastases, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. The current leading theory is the Nowell idea , which posits that metastatic capacity is achieved through the cumulative acquisition of metastatic traits due to the somatic evolution of tumor cells over time. However, this idea does not entirely align with all experimental data. Recent sequencing studies of metastatic cancers, derived from both mouse and human matched primary and metastatic samples, have failed to identify high-frequency metastasis driver genes . These findings suggest that metastatic disease may be driven more by metastasis-associated transcriptional programs mediated by changes in gene copy number, structural rearrangements, and responses to specific environmental conditions, rather than constitutional activation or inactivation of specific pathways.

[ABSTRACT] During meiosis, programmed DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme, Spo11, activating the DNA damage response ( DDR ) kinase Mec1ATR via the checkpoint clamp loader, Rad24RAD17. At single loci, loss of Mec1 and Rad24 activity alters DSB formation and recombination outcome, but their genome-wide roles have not been examined in detail. Here, we utilise two strategies—deletion of the mismatch repair protein, Msh2, and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor—to help characterise the roles Mec1 and Rad24 play in meiotic recombination by enabling genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny. In line with previous studies, we observe severely impacted spore viability and a reduction in the frequency of recombination upon deletion of RAD24—driven by a shortened prophase. By contrast, loss of Mec1 function increases recombination frequency, consistent with its role in DSB trans-interference, and has less effect on spore viability. Despite these differences, complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs—rare in wild-type cells—occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1, suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both. Mec1 and Rad24 also have important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers ( COs ). Upon loss of either Mec1 or Rad24, CO distributions become more random—suggesting reductions in the global manifestation of interference. Such effects are similar to, but less extreme than, the phenotype of ‘ZMM’ mutants such as zip3Δ, and may be driven by reductions in the proportion of interfering COs. Collectively, in addition to shared roles in CO regulation, our results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor, and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency, the loss of which helps to suppress any broader defects in CO regulation caused by abrogation of the DDR. Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that produces haploid cells for sexual reproduction. Integral to meiosis is the process of genetic recombination, which is initiated by programmed DNA double-strand breaks catalysed by the topoisomerase II-like enzyme, Spo11 . Meiotic recombination is monitored by the DNA damage response ( DDR ) in a similar manner to DNA lesions arising within vegetative cells, likely due to the potentially dangerous nature of DSBs. In the generalised pathway, DNA damage leads to the activation of Tel1ATM ( Ataxia Telangiectasia-Mutated ) and Mec1ATR ( Rad3-related ) checkpoint kinases ( Human orthologues are indicated with superscript text ), via the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2NBS1-complex and Rad24RAD17 ( reviewed in ). Rad24RAD17 is the loader of the Ddc1RAD9-Rad17RAD1-Mec3HUS1 ( “9-1-1” ) checkpoint clamp, that binds to the ssDNA/dsDNA junctions that arise following resection of DNA ends . Tel1ATM and Mec1ATR modulate downstream targets via Rad53CHK2 , causing cell cycle arrest and the modulation of transcription .

[ABSTRACT] Establishing suitable in vitro culture conditions for microorganisms is crucial for dissecting their biology and empowering potential applications. However, a significant number of bacterial and fungal species, including Pneumocystis jirovecii, remain unculturable, hampering research efforts. P. jirovecii is a deadly pathogen of humans that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. Despite the major impact of Pneumocystis on human health, limited progress has been made in dissecting the pathobiology of this fungus. This is largely due to the fact that its experimental dissection has been constrained by the inability to culture the organism in vitro. We present a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism, to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth in vitro. We utilise recently published genome data and available information in the literature as well as bioinformatics and software tools to develop and validate the model. In addition, we employ relaxed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches to make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and to identify critical components of the Pneumocystis growth medium. Our findings offer insights into the biology of Pneumocystis and provide a new strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing this pathogen in vitro. The experimental dissection of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, is greatly helped through access to suitable in vitro culture conditions that enable their independent growth within a laboratory setting. This dissection enhances our understanding of these microbes, their biology, and the potential applications of these organisms. By cultivating bacteria and fungi, we are able to investigate mechanisms that underlie the infectious diseases they elicit, refine diagnostic assays for these diseases, and develop new vaccines and therapeutic interventions. A significant number of bacterial and fungal species remain unculturable, thereby restricting research into these organisms. Examples of unculturable bacteria include the segmented filamentous bacteria, which are frequently found in the gut of mammals and are thought to modulate the immune system and promote gut-associated lymphoid tissue development . Additionally, unculturable Oscillospira species in the human gut are thought to be important for fibre degradation, immune modulation, and metabolic health . There is even a list of the ""most wanted"" taxa from the human microbiome, which includes numerous bacterial species that are considered highly significant for human health but remain unculturable . Viable but non-culturable ( VBNC ) cells represent another group of bacteria that is challenging to culture. These cells are metabolically active but cannot form colonies on standard culture media . Over 80 bacterial species are currently known to belong to this group including members of the Proteobacteria and, in particular, the human pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus .

[ABSTRACT] The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density. Conversely, at extremely high cell density, the Hippo pathway, which regulates YAP/TAZ, is activated. This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells. However, it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition ( contact inhibition ) under high-density conditions, thereby allowing continuous proliferation. In this study, we construct a three-dimensional ( 3D ) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a new modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics ( MD ) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell. We assume Lennard-Jones ( 12-6 ) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain. We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics. We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density. The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions. Finally, this mathematical model, which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells, and determining appropriate drug dosages. The source codes are freely available. The Hippo pathway has recently attracted attention as a molecular target for anticancer drugs and regenerative medicine . This unique pathway senses cell contacts and mechanical stimulation, supports organ size control and cell differentiation, and acts as a potent tumor suppressor gene . The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling cascade that controls organ size and tumorigenesis [2–4]. In mammals, the Hippo pathway involves two kinases: MST1/2 and LATS1/2. Under low-density conditions, MST1/2 and LATS1/2 remain inactive, allowing co-activators Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) to interact with transcription factors, such as TEAD1-4, in the nucleus, thereby inducing the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. In contrast, MST1/2 is activated first under high-density conditions, leading to the phosphorylation of LATS1/2. Activated LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP/TAZ leads to its sequestration in the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Consequently, the YAP/TAZ-induced expression of cell proliferation-related genes is inhibited [5–10].

[ABSTRACT] Many eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complexity domains ( LCDs ) with a strong propensity for binding and driving phase separation into biomolecular condensates. Mutations in LCDs frequently disrupt condensate dynamics, resulting in pathological transitions to solid-like states. Understanding how the molecular sequence grammar of LCDs governs condensate dynamics is essential for uncovering their biological functions and the evolutionary forces that shape these sequences. To this end, we present an energy landscape framework that operates on a continuous ‘stickiness’ energy scale rather than relying on an explicit alphabet-based sequence. Sequences are characterized by Wasserstein distance relative to thoroughly shuffled or random counterparts. Armed with an energy landscape framework, map diagrams of material and dynamical properties governed by key energy landscape features modulated by the degree of complexity in LCD arrangements, including the periodicity and local disorder in LCDs. Highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. Our results reveal that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates, thereby avoiding transitions to glassy or solid-like states. Moreover, we demonstrate that the energy landscape framework explains the recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity. Our work provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties whereby key features of energy landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable. A significant fraction of the eukaryotic proteome contains sequences with low-complexity domains ( LCDs ) [1–3]. Proteins with LCDs display high conformational flexibility and affinity for binding and phase separation into biomolecular condensates, which engage in numerous organizational, regulatory, and signaling functions . The material properties and dynamics of condensates appear crucial for functions and are tightly regulated in cells . Misregulation of material properties often leads to loss of condensate fluidity and an irreversible transition to solid-like states associated with pathological diseases . In vitro experiments have further demonstrated that dynamic and material properties of condensates are sensitive to sequence mutations, particularly in regions containing LCDs [9–15]. At the same time, globally, the sequences of proteins with LCDs, which often correspond to intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ), are not well-conserved . Therefore, it is puzzling how sequence variability is compatible with persistent cellular function and, if so, how choice of specific sequence patterning is ultimately chosen. Some of these observations have been rationalized by sticker and spacer models, which have provided some insights into sequence-dependent structural and thermodynamic properties of condensates [17–20]. For instance, in recent reports, flow activation energies of various condensate phases were measured, finding that localized sticky motifs in sequences dramatically alter network reconfiguration times in condensates, thereby contributing to observed sequence dependence of viscosities . Nevertheless, the molecular grammar and evolutionary forces behind the widespread presence of LCD patterns in condensate-forming biomolecules remain poorly understood. For foldable proteins, the energy landscape framework has provided clear biophysical principles for sequences of natural proteins [23–25].

[ABSTRACT] The development of ectodermal organs begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that progressively invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme as the organ takes its shape. Signaling by secreted molecules is critical for epithelial morphogenesis, but how that information leads to cell rearrangement and tissue shape changes remains an open question. Using the mouse dentition as a model, we first establish that non-muscle myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and show that it functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer. Shh signaling controls these processes by inducing myosin II activation via AKT. Pharmacological induction of AKT and myosin II can also rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh. Together, our results support a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through myosin II to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination. The formation of ectodermal organs, such as teeth, hair follicles, and glands, is a remarkable morphogenetic process that transforms simple epithelia into multilayered structures with distinct morphologies . At the onset of this transformation, locally thickened epithelium, known as the placode, first stratifies and produces suprabasal cells that lie atop the basal layer. The epithelium then progressively bends and invaginates towards the underlying mesenchyme to form a bud shaped structure, which then undergoes further growth, invagination, and organ-specific shape changes . Epithelial invagination therefore represents a basic developmental module important for building epithelial organs, and disruption in this process underlies many genetic disorders that cause dysgenesis of ectodermal structures . However, the underlying molecular and regulatory mechanisms involved in epithelial invagination are still poorly understood. The mouse tooth has long served as a model for understanding epithelial morphogenesis . Beginning at embryonic day 11 ( E11 ), the dental placode emerges as a thickened stripe across the oral surface, marking the earliest morphological sign of tooth formation . The dental placode then enlarges and invaginates into the underlying condensing mesenchyme, such that by E12. 5 both incisor and molar buds are formed. A toothless space called the diastema separates these buds, as mouse dentition is reduced and lacks canines and pre-molars. Incisors and molars next undergo comparable morphological changes as they continue to invaginate into the mesenchyme, progressing through the cap and bell stages until the tooth erupts, although the incisor epithelium develops in an asymmetrical manner and turns posteriorly during the bud-to-cap transition at E13. 5. Through genetic studies in both mice and humans, we now know that many transcription factors and components of signaling pathways play critical roles during tooth development , but how they modulate cell behaviors to control morphogenesis is only beginning to be understood. Several recent studies have unveiled the well-coordinated patterns of cell proliferation and movement during the multi-step process of molar epithelial invagination. At the onset of epithelial bending, cellular protrusions at the apical surface are centripetally-oriented and push inner cells downwards to deform the epithelium .

[ABSTRACT] The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological process. Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data. However, the current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. Here, we present a strong deep transfer model based graph convolutional network, scTGCN, which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation, while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq. Thus, scTGCN shows high label transfer accuracy and effectively knowledge transfer across different modalities. Single-cell genomics give us new perspectives to understand the genetics in the cellular level. With the rapid development of methods for single cell RNA sequences such as 10X Chromium ( PBMC ), Smart-seq2 , SNARE-seq and SHARE-seq . Technologies for measure other modalities, single-cell chromatin accessibility sequence , proteomics , spatial transcriptomics and metabolomics have been developed. However, each technology only reveal a particular aspect of cellular state and identity. They both have unique strengths and weaknesses. In particular, scATAC-seq is a strong indicator of functional DNA sequence which can be used to identify cell subpopulations with different chromatin accessibility profiles. Nevertheless, scATAC-seq coupled with the sparsity of signals due to low detection efficiency and cell-type identify accuracy present a huge computational challenge. In contrast, large amounts of well-annotated scRNA-seq data have been curated , catalyzing us to transfer cell type information from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq. Integration of single-cell multi omics data is still a great challenge due to the heterogeneity across multiple datasets, including inherent highly sparse and imcompatible dimension between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. A large number of methods have been developed for scRNA-seq data integration. Such as scmp , scAlign , DCA , scVI . And many methods have been developed for scATAC-seq data including chromVAR , cisTopic , Scasat and SnapATAC . The methods were proposed for integrating paired and unpaired single cell modalities data, such as DVAE , scMVAE , DCCA , Seurat , MOFA+ and scJoint have limitted performance. Moreover, in most case, datasets are unpaired. Most modalities are sampled from the same sample or tissue. In this setting, the high efficiency computational methods are scarcely and most existing methods can be classified into two categories: one kind such as Conos , Seurat3 and Liger based nearest neighbor graph structure and matrix factorization. Specifically, methods that use mutual nearest neighbors ( MNN ) for data alignment become less scalable as datasets exceed one million cell.

[ABSTRACT] Proteins with nuclear localization sequences ( NLSs ) are directed into the cell nucleus through interactions between the NLS and importin proteins. NLSs are generally short motifs rich in basic amino acids; however, identifying NLSs can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence. In this study, we characterized the sequence specificity of an essential and conserved NLS in Mcm3, a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 ( AF3 ) modeling, we demonstrate that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth. Our results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs, which, despite lacking a single consensus sequence, retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen. The nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ), a short motif rich in basic amino acids, controls the import of many nuclear proteins [1–13]. Two types of NLS have been identified: monopartite and bipartite [1–3, 11–13]. A monopartite NLS consists of a single, continuous stretch of basic amino acids, including lysine and arginine [1–3, 11, 13]. The NLS from SV40’s large T antigen ( 126PKKKRKV133 ), which contains five contiguous basic residues, is a classic example of a monopartite NLS . In contrast, a bipartite NLS is characterized by two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a short spacer region, as seen in proteins such as nucleoplasmin and many others [1–3, 12, 13]. Both monopartite and bipartite NLSs function by interacting with proteins in the importin family, which are key transport receptors that recognize and guide NLS-containing proteins through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus . Structural studies have provided substantial insights into the interaction between NLSs and importin alpha, revealing that this binding involves both hydrophobic and charge-charge interactions, with multiple basic residues in the NLS contacting negatively charged residues on importin alpha [4, 15–18]. This is supported through genetic studies, which illustrate that mutating Lys-128 in the SV40 NLS to non-basic residues significantly impaired nuclear import , whereas mutating it to arginine disrupts nuclear import without affecting viral replication . In contrast, mutation of a nearby basic residue in the SV40 NLS ( Lys-131 ) to methionine did not significantly affect nuclear import , suggesting that specific basic residues within the SV40 NLS may play distinct roles in controlling nuclear import. In addition to the SV40 NLS, other monopartite NLSs have been identified, including those in H2B, v-Jun, and various others proteins [1–10, 13]. Although these NLSs, like the SV40 NLS, are rich in basic residues, sequence variations among them raise questions about whether they interact with importin alpha in a similar manner .

[ABSTRACT] Ataxin-2 ( ATXN2 ) is a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II ( SCA2 ), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and Parkinsonism. The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions. ATXN2 ( or Atx2 in insects ) can function in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability and in the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ). Previous work has shown that the LSm ( Like-Sm ) domain of Atx2, which can help stimulate mRNA translation, antagonizes mRNP-granule assembly. Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing ( TRIBE ), co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that a polyA-binding protein ( PABP ) interacting, PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 may be a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules. Experiments with transgenic Drosophila indicate that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration, structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both support Atx2-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, the data lead to a proposal for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation as well as to neurodegeneration. mRNP granules are intriguing, dynamic membrane-less organelles containing translationally repressed mRNAs, RNA-binding proteins ( RBPs ), molecular chaperones and a variety of other cellular proteins [1–5]. The formation and composition of mRNP assemblies are determined by base-pairing interactions between mRNAs, protein-protein interactions and RBP-RNA interactions, whose respective contributions may vary across granule types and physiological states [6–9]. Stress granules ( SGs ) are particularly well-studied granules that form when cellular stress signals mediated by eIF2α kinase activation cause individual mRNPs to arrest in translation and condense into multi-mRNP assemblies [11–13]. Mutations in mRNP granule proteins, including TDP-43, FUS, Ataxin-2, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1, EWSR1, have been associated with ALS and/or other forms of neurodegenerative disease [14–20]. For this reason, and because TDP-43 and other stress-granule protein aggregates are components of protein inclusions found in ALS and Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ), the regulation and cellular functions of SGs have been topics of considerable fundamental and clinical interest [20–26]. The cast of intermolecular interactions required for mRNP-granule assembly and the precise sequence with which they occur are not yet explained . However, many studies show that intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) found on mRNP-granule proteins contribute substantially to RNP granule assembly [28–35]. In biochemical experiments, such IDRs show the ability to phase separate into liquid-like assemblies [35–45]. The accessibility or activities of IDRs can be tightly regulated by posttranslational modifications, allowing rapid physiological and spatial control over granule assembly and disassembly [29, 35, 46–52]. An important observation is that most IDRs also can transition from liquid-like state into solid, beta-sheet rich, amyloid-fibrils in vitro, particularly at high concentrations achieved in the liquid phase [22, 41, 53–55].

[ABSTRACT] Gene regulatory networks that act upstream of skeletal muscle fate determinants are distinct in different anatomical locations. Despite recent efforts, a clear understanding of the cascade of events underlying the emergence and maintenance of the stem cell pool in specific muscle groups remains unresolved and debated. Here, we invalidated Pitx2 with multiple Cre-driver mice prenatally, postnatally, and during lineage progression. We showed that this gene becomes progressively dispensable for specification and maintenance of the muscle stem ( MuSC ) cell pool in extraocular muscles ( EOMs ) despite being, together with Myf5, a major upstream regulator during early development. Moreover, constitutive inactivation of Pax7 postnatally led to a greater loss of MuSCs in the EOMs compared to the limb. Thus, we propose a relay between Pitx2, Myf5 and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance. We demonstrate also that MuSCs in the EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier that those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult, yet EOMs have a significantly higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and post-natally. Finally, while limb MuSCs proliferate in the mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, significantly less MuSCs were present in the EOMs of the mdx mouse model compared to controls, and they were not proliferative. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and brings further insights into the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy. Muscle stem cells ( MuSCs ) arise during late foetal development and contribute to the postnatal growth of muscle fibres. They are the main players for reconstituting muscle fibres during regeneration. This population of stem cells emerges in an asynchronous manner in different anatomical locations, and it exhibits an unusual diversity in developmental origins and genetic regulation depending on the muscle group in which it resides [1–3]. Understanding the physiological mechanisms controlling the development of different muscle groups, and how they are selectively deregulated or spared during disease and ageing, is crucial for devising therapeutic strategies for a wide range of myopathies. Extraocular muscles ( EOMs ) include 4 recti muscles ( superior, inferior, medial, and lateral ) and 2 oblique muscles ( superior and inferior ) for movement of the eyeball, and arise from different cranial mesoderm populations [4–6]. They are spared during ageing and in Duchenne, Becker, and some limb girdle muscular dystrophies [7–9]. While the underlying causes for their sparing are unclear, intrinsic differences in MuSCs of the EOMs have been proposed as contributing factors [10–12]. Yet, the precise mechanisms governing the emergence and maintenance of these and other cranial MuSC populations remain obscure. Myogenic commitment and differentiation throughout the body is regulated by basic helix-loop-helix myogenic regulatory factors ( MRFs ) comprising Myf5, Mrf4, Myod and Myogenin ( Myog ).

[ABSTRACT] With the ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) and its increasing adaptation to humans, several variants of concern ( VOCs ) and variants of interest ( VOIs ) have been identified since late 2020. These include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron parent lineage, and other variants. These variants may show distinct levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, which require specific defense and control measures. In this study, we propose an SI1…InR infectious disease model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among the human population. We combine the proposed epidemic model and reported infected data of variants with physical information neural networks ( PINNs ) to develop a new process called VOCs-informed neural network ( VOCs-INN ). In our experiments, we found that this algorithm can accurately fit the reported data of the British Columbia ( BC ) province and its five internal health agencies in Canada. Furthermore, it can simulate observed or unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and enable short-term predictions. The experimental results also reveal variations in the intensity of control strategies implemented across these regions. VOCs-INN performs well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data. The evolution and mutation of viruses are typical processes that allow them to adjust to various environments and hosts. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to evolve and mutate. Since October 2020, several SARS-CoV-2 variants with significant mutations have emerged and been classified by the WHO as VOCs ( variants of concern ) or VOIs ( variants of interest ). These variants exhibit differences in transmissibility, disease severity, immune evasion capabilities, and responsiveness to treatments. According to the WHO’s updated definition in March 2023, compared to VOIs, VOCs represent major evolutionary advancements and necessitate substantial public health measures. To evaluate the risk, simulating the transmission process within the population and determining the time-dependent characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial. Epidemiological models, represented by parameterized differential equations, are essential tools for studying the patterns of COVID-19 transmission and developing prevention and control strategies [1–7]. The input parameters, which may vary over time, can impact the model’s predictability. Various methodologies can be used to fit the trend of disease progression and determine the values or ranges of parameters. These methods primarily depend on mathematical models and statistical principles, along with the analysis of actual epidemiological data, such as the least squares method , the Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) approach , and the iterative filtering method . The methods mentioned above may face some limitations in practical applications. Furthermore, factors like intervention measures, human activities, and virus mutations could potentially alter the parameters of the epidemic model over time. However, most parameter estimation techniques assume these parameters remain constant over time. Therefore, it can be difficult to accurately estimate how these parameters change over time and capture the complex dynamics of infectious diseases in real-world situations using these methods.

[ABSTRACT] Image-based cell profiling is a powerful tool that compares perturbed cell populations by measuring thousands of single-cell features and summarizing them into profiles. Typically a sample is represented by averaging across cells, but this fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations. We introduce CytoSummaryNet: a Deep Sets-based approach that improves process of action prediction by 30–68% in mean average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset. CytoSummaryNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance learning framework, providing an easier-to-apply method for aggregating single-cell feature data than previously published strategies. Interpretability analysis suggests that the model achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells. The approach requires only perturbation labels for training, which are readily available in all cell profiling datasets. CytoSummaryNet offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets. High-throughput assays enable quantifying cellular responses to perturbations at a large scale. Image-based assays are among the most accessible and inexpensive such technologies that offer single-cell resolution. Cell populations are perturbed with compounds or genetic perturbations, stained, and then imaged. Large amounts of quantitative morphological data are extracted from these microscopy images, generating tabular data comprising single cell profiles. These single cell profiles are then aggregated by a variety of methods to a per-perturbation profile that describes that population’s phenotype. The profiles of different cell populations can be compared to identify previously unrecognized cell states induced by experimental perturbations. This method, called image-based cell profiling, is a powerful tool that can be used for drug discovery, functional genomics, and disease phenotyping . Among other applications, image-based profiling has already been used to predict assay outcomes for compounds [2–4], detect leukemia label-free , and predict the impact of particular gene mutations . Image-based cell profiling shows great potential, but many steps in its pipeline can still be improved . One of the challenges is to capture both population trends and single-cell variability. Cell populations are known to be heterogeneous , and recent studies have yielded many insights into the mechanisms and importance of this characteristic [9–12]. Capturing that heterogeneity could improve a profile’s information content and, thus, utility in many image-based profiling applications. Despite its current limitations, so-called population-averaged profiling, where all single-cell features are averaged per feature using either the mean or the median, remains the most commonly-used approach in the field of image-based profiling. This is true regardless of the types of features or the kinds of transformations ( e. g., normalization, feature selection, etc. ) applied to the profiles . Average profiling is a simple way of summarizing a cell population ( hereafter referred to as a sample ) into a vector ( a sample’s profile ) with only one value per measured feature.

[ABSTRACT] The ability to solve complex tasks relies on the adaptive changes occurring in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions. Altered flexibility in these dynamics can lead to impaired cognitive performance, manifesting for instance as difficulties in attention regulation, distraction inhibition, and behavioral adaptation. Such impairments result in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks. Therefore, developing quantitative measures that can directly assess the effort involved in these transitions using neural data is of paramount importance. In this study, we propose a framework to associate cognitive effort during the performance of tasks with electroencephalography ( EEG ) activation patterns. The methodology relies on the identification of discrete dynamical states ( EEG microstates ) and optimal transport theory. To validate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task, a cognitive test in which participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. The Stroop task is a cognitive test where participants must respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. Our findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive effort, thus confirming the framework’s effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions. By utilizing a fully data-driven method, this research opens up fresh perspectives for physiologically describing cognitive effort within the brain. The complex activity patterns that support perception, cognition, and behavior in the healthy brain arise from the interactions of neuronal populations across various spatial and temporal scales . At the macroscale, brain activity is characterized by spatially distributed groups of regions that exhibit temporally correlated activity and co-activate during behavioral tasks, thus acting as functional networks . Recently, it has been shown that such functional networks may reflect the long-time average of rapidly switching metastable patterns ( also called “metastable substates” or “dynamical states” ), which are consistently observed with different imaging methods [3–7]. In the M/EEG literature, these patterns are termed “microstates” and are highly reproducible across studies and clustering techniques [8–10]. As our environment is constantly evolving, with new stimuli and challenges emerging regularly, our brain must remain flexible and adaptable to respond effectively to these changes. A crucial component that drives such reconfiguration is “executive functioning” or “cognitive control” [11–13]. This construct refers to the set of processes and mechanisms that enable goal-directed behavior in the face of changing circumstances [11, 14–16]. When confronted with challenging situations, cognitive control allows the brain to regulate attention, inhibit irrelevant information, and shift cognitive resources to prioritize relevant tasks or goals . Concurrently, it has been shown that the dynamical properties of the metastable substates during different active conditions are modulated compared with the resting state. Such adaptation has been demonstrated in a large variety of conditions such as cognitive loads , sleep-awake cycle , habituation of cognitive tasks , and is reflected in the overall reconfiguration of functional connectivity [21–23].

[ABSTRACT] Expansion of atypical memory B cells ( aMBCs ) was demonstrated in malaria-exposed individuals. To date, the generation of P. vivax-specific aMBCs and their function in protective humoral immune responses is unknown. Here, P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein II ( PvDBPII ) probes were generated to detect the development and durability of specific aMBCs, and to demonstrate the capacity of these cells to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. PvDBPII-specific aMBCs were elicited during malaria illness, and they persisted through the recovery phase of infections. To address biology and function of P. vivax-specific aMBCs in producing protective antibodies, a single MBC was cultured, and the secreted IgG was tested for binding and inhibition activity. The aMBC-derived clones produced antibodies with variable levels of anti-PvDBPII IgG in cultures, and some produced high antibody levels comparable to classical MBC clones. Thus, we focused our attention on the function of aMBCs in producing neutralizing antibodies. Among the aMBC clones, A1F12 and B4E11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBPII variants. Notably, B cell receptors ( BCRs ) of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs expressed unique IGHV genes, with similar usage of IGHV1-3, comparable to classical MBCs. The somatic hypermutation ( SHM ) rate and CDR3 length of VH and Vκ in these two MBC subsets were not significantly different. Together, our findings revealed that P. vivax infections elicited the development and persistence of P. vivax-specific aMBCs. The accumulation of aMBCs during and following infections might play an important role in producing protective antibodies against malaria. Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread human malaria parasite. It predominates outside Africa, especially in Asia and Latin America, with more than 14 million cases occurring each year. More than one third of the global population is at risk of vivax malaria . Given the rapid spread of drug-resistant parasite strains and the formation of hypnozoites in the liver with potential to cause relapse and the diversity of antigens, a highly effective vaccine to prevent the disease is essential .

Naturally acquired antibody responses against P. vivax infections increase with age as a result of repeated exposure to the parasite . These antibodies do not prevent infection but do decrease parasite density, the frequency of clinical symptoms and disease severity .

[ABSTRACT] Polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes has become important in human genetics, especially in the context of precision medicine. Recently, mr. mash, a flexible and computationally efficient method that models multiple phenotypes jointly and leverages sharing of effects across such phenotypes to improve prediction accuracy, was introduced. However, a drawback of mr. mash is that it requires individual-level data, which are often not publicly available. In this work, we introduce mr. mash-rss, an extension of the mr. mash model that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) and linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) estimates from a reference panel. By using summary data, we achieve the twin goal of increasing the applicability of the mr. mash model to data sets that are not publicly available and making it scalable to biobank-size data. Through simulations, we show that mr. mash-rss is competitive with, and often outperforms, current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in a variety of scenarios that differ in the pattern of effect sharing across phenotypes, the number of phenotypes, the number of causal variants, and the genomic heritability. We also present a real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank, showing that mr. mash-rss achieves higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits, especially when the data set has smaller sample size. Predicting complex trait phenotypes from genotypes is a central task of a few branches of quantitative genetics. In agricultural breeding, there is interest in predicting breeding values ( EBV ) to select the best individuals for reproduction and achieve an increase in performance over generations . In human genetics, predicting medically relevant phenotypes such as disease risk via polygenic scores ( PGS ) is important to stratify the population and identify individuals with greater genetic risk . Finally, with the advent of transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ), predicting gene expression as an intermediate step has become of interest . In all these applications, accurate predictions are important. The response to artificial selection is directly proportional to the accuracy of EBVs . Precise identification of individuals at risk for a particular disease requires accurate PGS . The power to discover gene-phenotype associations in TWAS depends on the accuracy of gene expression prediction . Technically, phenotypic prediction is achieved by modeling the phenotype of interest as a multiple regression on genotypes at a set of genetic variants . Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to multiple regression have been developed for and/or applied to this task, with accuracy spanning from very low to high depending on the genetic architecture of the trait analyzed [7–12]. Multiple phenotypes may be genetically correlated due to pleiotropy ( i. e., the sharing of causal variants across traits ). In that case, modeling these phenotypes jointly via multivariate multiple regression methods can improve effect sizes estimates by leveraging effect sharing and, thus, increase prediction accuracy [13–17].

[ABSTRACT] Accurate prediction of epidemics is pivotal for making well-informed decisions for the control of infectious diseases, but addressing heterogeneity in the system poses a challenge. In this study, we propose a new modelling framework integrating the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models, by introducing a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations ( UDE ) model. Simultaneously, we pre-set a specific form for the recruitment rate and develop a mechanistic model. Data from a COVID Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the UDE model using deep learning methods and to calibrate the mechanistic model using MCMC methods. then, we project the attack rate and peak of new infections for the first Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the dynamic zero-COVID policy. Our projections indicate an attack rate and a peak of new infections of 80. 06% and 3. 17% of the population, respectively, compared with the homogeneous model’s projections of 99. 97% and 32. 78%, thus providing an 18. 6% improvement in the prediction accuracy based on the actual data. Our simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in the susceptibles decreases herd immunity for ~37. 36% of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from ~30 days to ~70 days, also aligning with the real case. We consider that this study lays the groundwork for the development of a new class of models and new insights for modelling heterogeneity. Over the past few decades, emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, influenza A H1N1, and SARS-CoV-2, have posed significant threats to global public health [1–3], and the control of such infectious diseases has garnered considerable attention from researchers . Mathematical models play a crucial role as tools for understanding the transmission mechanisms of emerging infectious diseases, predicting epidemic trends, and evaluating transmission risks. These models can aid in optimizing control strategies to enhance global public health and reduce economic costs [6–8]. In particular, the precise prediction of epidemic trends serves as a foundational basis for decision-making in the implementation of control interventions. However, there are numerous challenges associated with achieving accurate predictions, with heterogeneity being one of the significant obstacles to achieving precise predictions. A susceptible population is usually defined as comprising those individuals who can be infected by a virus or other pathogen. The transmission of pathogens occurs through several mechanisms: one is direct transmission involving physical contact between infectious individuals and the susceptible population, as seen with many respiratory viruses. In another process, unique to vector-borne diseases transmission occurs when an infected vector, such as a mosquito, bites a susceptible human. Sexually transmitted diseases are spread through sexual contact, which can include any form of sexual activity involving the exchange of body fluids.

[ABSTRACT] Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability. Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising. Here we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. To show this, we developed a mathematical framework, in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain, dynamic environment. This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is being updated by a synaptic learning rule, which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. In addition, this approach entails that a synapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential. Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its postsynaptic neuron, we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. Hereby, synapses coordinate themselves to represent and use uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations. Synapses are inherently unreliable in transmitting their input to the post-synaptic neuron. For example, the probability of neurotransmitter release is typically around 50% [1–3] and can be as low as 20% in vivo . In other words, up to 80% of synaptic transmissions fail due to release unreliability, providing one of the major sources of noise in the synapse. Pre- and post-synaptic noise sources result in a large trial-by-trial variability in the post-synaptic current ( PSC ) . At the same time, synapses are very demanding in terms of energy consumption , suggesting that a large portion of the body’s energy intake dissipates by the unreliability of synaptic transmission. Similar to biological synapses also neuromorphic technologies are exposed to noise culminating in unreliable synaptic transmission [7–9]. The functional implication of noisy synaptic transmission, and whether it is a feature or bug in biological and artificial neuronal systems, is therefore highly debated [5, 10–13]. Here, we show that synapses can exploit noisy synaptic transmission to encode their uncertainty about the somatic membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron. With each synapse doing this, we further show that this enables a neuronal network to encode and use uncertainties. To establish this result, we rely on the predictive processing model framework to describe biological systems that act in uncertain environments. Predictive processing ( PP ) is based on the idea that biological systems instantiate an internal model of their environment that allows them to make predictions, take actions, and to minimize surprise [14–17]. In the PP formalism, an agent uses internal states to form an internal model of its environment based on perceived stimuli ( Fig 1Ai ).

[ABSTRACT] Cell lineage tree reconstruction methods are developed for various tasks, such as investigating the development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable more thorough analysis with higher resolution. We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method using bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Common challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, are included in Scuphr. Scuphr computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With its embarrassingly parallel design, Scuphr can do faster analysis than the state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. The method’s robustness is investigated using various synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells. Reconstructing cell lineage trees, from single-cell data, for healthy tissue is a fundamental computational problem with enormous potential for studies of development and differentiation [1–6]. There are two related reconstruction problems for cancer tumors: reconstruction of clonal trees and the reconstruction of tumor phylogenies from single cells. Several data types, e. g., bulk DNA, single-cell DNA, and single-cell RNA, have been used for the latter two problems [7–11]. All these reconstruction methods exploit mutations and attempt to reconstruct trees in which the proximity between a pair of cells, or clones, is correlated with the similarity between their patterns of mutations. The somatic mutation rate in humans is 10−9 per locus per cell division , and the copy number is not considered to carry substantial information regarding cell lineage membership in healthy tissue. Therefore, mutations are scarce when reconstructing lineage trees for healthy tissues, implying that more sophisticated models and computational methods are needed to capitalize fully on the existing mutations. This scarcity also highlights the need for single-cell DNA sequencing ( scDNA-seq ) data since it reveals more point mutations than any other current data type . Regardless of its potential to reveal mutations, scDNA-seq data comes with its challenges [14–18]. Due to the small amount of genomic data available in a single cell, the genome needs to be amplified before sequencing . Unfortunately, the whole-genome amplification methods, such as the multiple displacement amplification ( MDA ) method and the multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles ( MALBAC ) method , introduce technical artifacts known as amplification errors ( AEs ) that are hard to distinguish from mutations. Moreover, so-called allelic dropout ( ADO ) events remain even after the amplification. In addition, the subsequent sequencing of the amplified materials introduces sequencing errors [22–25]. There have been several methods explicitly made for scDNA-seq data, both for identifying mutations ( single nucleotide variant ( SNV ) callers ) and for reconstructing cell lineage trees, although several of them are targeting cancer data.

[ABSTRACT] An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population-health outcomes given the available health system capacity. Efforts to achieve this are often framed through the lens of “health benefits packages” ( HBPs ), which seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision. Analytic approaches widely used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process however have limitations. In this work, we propose the individual-based Thanzi La Onse ( TLO ) model as a uniquely-tailored tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs while addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modelling—and calibrating to extensive, country-specific data—the incidence of disease, health-seeking behaviour, and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health available, we were able to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for the country. We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis ( LCOA ) achieved the largest health gain—∼8% reduction in disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario—by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments. This HBP however incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation. Other feasible approaches to prioritisation were assessed, including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics, rather than service type. Unlike the LCOA-based HBP, this approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year- to-year basis, and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period, which suggests an approach based upon patient characteristics might prove beneficial in the future. How should limited resources be allocated to achieve the greatest possible return in health ? This difficult question is one every public healthcare provider must grapple with; it is however a particularly urgent one in low-income settings, where available financial resources are limited, and their inefficient allocation results in a much larger loss of health and life . A widely adopted strategy to address this question and inform the allocation of healthcare resources in many low- and middle- income countries is through the design of “health benefits packages” ( HBPs ). HBPs seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should focus on delivering, given that it is unable to take financial responsibility for the full range of possible services . Although the objectives of HBPs are well defined, focusing typically on efficiency and equity in resource allocation, identifying the appropriate design for HBPs is far more challenging .

[ABSTRACT] Precise regulation of chromosome dynamics in the germline is essential for reproductive success across species. Yet, the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosomal events such as homolog pairing and chromosome segregation are not fully understood in many species. Here, we employ Oligopaint DNA FISH to investigate mechanisms of meiotic homolog pairing and chromosome segregation in the holocentric pantry moth, Plodia interpunctella, and compare our findings to new and previous studies in the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori, which diverged from P. interpunctella over 100 million years ago. We find that pairing in both Bombyx and Plodia spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. Additionally, both species form rod shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I. However, unlike the telomere-oriented chromosome segregation process observed in Bombyx, Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple different ways at metaphase I. Surprisingly, in both species we find that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromosomes regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent. Additionally, sister kinetochores do not seem to be paired in these species. Instead, four distinct kinetochores are easily observed at metaphase I. Despite this, we find clear end-on microtubule attachments and not lateral microtubule attachments co-orienting these separated kinetochores. These findings challenge the classical view of segregation where paired, poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I. Our studies here highlight the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, as employing new organisms can lead to the discovery of new biology. Chromosome segregation is an essential part of cell division in both somatic and germline tissues. In the specialized meiotic cell divisions in the germline, chromosomes undergo an intricate multi-step alignment process before chromosome segregation can occur. First, chromosomes become more linear, then homologous chromosomes ( maternal and paternal copies of the same chromosome ) find each other and pair from end-to-end. This end-to-end pairing allows for crossover recombination and the formation of chiasmata, which link homologous chromosomes together. These linkages assist in the proper bi-orientation of homologs on the metaphase I spindle, where homologous kinetochores must face opposite spindle poles for accurate chromosome segregation. Each of these steps needs to be executed accurately to avoid chromosome segregation defects during meiosis such as nondisjunction. Even though the processes that occur during early meiosis are largely conserved ( homolog pairing, recombination, and segregation ), researchers have found that different molecular mechanisms mediate these processes in different species. For example, in both male and female meiosis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, centromeres and pericentric heterochromatin have been implicated in early meiotic pairing events at ( or even before ) meiotic entry [1–8], and centromeres also mediate chromosome segregation at metaphase I ( reviewed in ).

[ABSTRACT] The median eminence ( ME ), located at the base of the hypothalamus, is an essential centre of information exchange between the brain and the pituitary. We and others previously showed that mutations and duplications affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox3 result in hypopituitarism, and this is likely of hypothalamic origin. We demonstrate here that the absence of Sox3 predominantly affects the ME with phenotypes that first occur in juvenile animals, despite the embryonic onset of SOX3 expression. In the pituitary, reduction in hormone levels correlates with a lack of endocrine cell maturation. In parallel, ME NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential are affected. We further show that low-dose aspirin treatment, which is known to affect NG2-glia, or changes in gut microbiota, rescue both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants. Our study highlights a central role of NG2-glia for ME function during a transitional period of post-natal development and indicates their sensitivity to extrinsic signals. The hypothalamus is a crucial regulator of homeostasis and energy balance in vertebrates. It centralizes information from other regions of the brain and from the periphery, while an important part of its function is to regulate the secretion of pituitary hormones. These control essential functions, including post-natal growth, puberty, pregnancy, fertility, lactation, stress and energy homeostasis. Consequently, pituitary hormone deficiencies ( hypopituitarism ) are associated with significant morbidity. The murine pituitary gland, which is located under the hypothalamus, has three compartments: the anterior pituitary lobe ( AL ), containing five different endocrine cell types, the intermediate ( IL ) with one ( melanotrophs ), and the posterior pituitary, composed of glial cells and hypothalamic axonal termini. The hypothalamus connects to the pituitary via the pituitary stalk, which itself contains neuronal, glial, and vascular components. AL endocrine cells are regulated by neurohormones secreted by different hypothalamic neurons into a bed of fenestrated capillaries located at the base of the third ventricle, in a structure called the median eminence ( ME ). These neurohormones are delivered to the anterior pituitary by the hypophyseal portal system. Conversely, for the posterior pituitary, neurohormones ( oxytocin and vasopressin ) are released directly from hypothalamic axons that reach the gland itself . The ME, which is located outside the blood-brain barrier , and the pituitary stalk are crucial components of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, as flow of information in and out of the hypothalamus is respectively collected and conveyed through these structures. In addition to the blood vessels, several cell types, including glial cells and microglia, are found in the ME ( for review see ). NG2-glia, or oligodendrocyte precursor cells ( OPCs ), are present in ME [4–6]. They are the most proliferative cells within the central nervous system ( CNS ) and their canonical function is to generate oligodendrocytes, although rarely astrocytes and neurons in some contexts. However, they also fulfil other roles, such as interacting with and modulating the function of neighbouring neurons, astrocytes or microglia ( for review see ).

[ABSTRACT] Coordinated activation and inhibition of F-actin supports the movements of morphogenesis. Understanding the proteins that regulate F-actin is important, since these proteins are mis-regulated in diseases like cancer. Our studies of C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis identified the GTPase CED-10/Rac1 as an essential activator of F-actin. However, we need to identify the GEF, or Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor, that activates CED-10/Rac1 during embryonic cell migrations. The two-component GEF, CED-5/CED-12, is known to activate CED-10/Rac1 to promote cell movements that result in the engulfment of dying cells during embryogenesis, and a later cell migration of the larval Distal Tip Cell. It is believed that CED-5/CED-12 powers cellular movements of corpse engulfment and DTC migration by promoting F-actin formation. Therefore, we tested if CED-5/CED-12 was involved in embryonic migrations, and got a contradictory result. CED-5/CED-12 definitely support embryonic migrations, since their loss led to embryos that died due to failed epidermal cell migrations. However, CED-5/CED-12 inhibited F-actin in the migrating epidermis, the opposite of what was expected for a CED-10 GEF. To address how CED-12/CED-5 could have two opposing effects on F-actin, during corpse engulfment and cell migration, we investigated if CED-12 harbors GAP ( GTPase Activating Protein ) functions. A candidate GAP region in CED-12 faces away from the CED-5 GEF catalytic region. Mutating a candidate catalytic Arginine in the CED-12 GAP region ( R537A ) altered the epidermal cell migration function, and not the corpse engulfment function. We interfered with GEF function by interfering with CED-5’s ability to bind Rac1/CED-10. Mutating Serine-Arginine in CED-5/DOCK predicted to bind and stabilize Rac1 for catalysis, resulted in loss of both ventral enclosure and corpse engulfment. Genetic and expression studies strongly support that the GAP function likely acts on different GTPases. Thus, we propose CED-5/CED-12 support the cycling of multiple GTPases, by using distinct domains, to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation. Organized F-actin is required for cell migrations, and for engulfment of dying cells and cellular debris. The idea that the processes of cell migration and cell/corpse or debris engulfment use related actin regulators has been proposed for processes like macrophage migration and engulfment in Drosophila . The idea that embryonic cell migrations and cell corpse engulfment are linked in C. elegans was suggested when we reported that loss of the Arp2/3 regulators, gex-2 and gex-3, resulted in both long-lived corpses and epidermal migration defects, similar to loss of Rac1/ced-10 . These studies raised the question of how actin is regulated during two apparently distinct processes, epidermal enclosure, a collective cell migration by the epidermal cells to engulf the entire embryo, and corpse engulfment, where part of the membrane of individual cells reorganizes to engulf their dying neighbors. Epiboly, the process that creates the metazoan body plan, depends on regulated sheet migrations. In C. elegans, epiboly begins at the 400-cell stage, when the main embryonic tissues begin to differentiate, and the epidermis begins its complex migrations ( Fig 1A ).

[ABSTRACT] A core challenge for the brain is to process information across various timescales. This could be achieved by a hierarchical organization of temporal processing through intrinsic mechanisms ( e. g., recurrent coupling or adaptation ), but recent evidence from spike recordings of the rodent visual system seems to conflict with this idea. Here, we used an optimized information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to show that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Moreover, intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent. We could reproduce these observations in a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input. Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. The brain has the ability to seamlessly process and integrate information on vastly different timescales. In primates, past work suggested that this may be supported by two essential features of neocortex: the highly recurrent architecture of cortical networks , and an organization of different cortical areas into a temporal processing hierarchy [2–4]. It was found that early sensory areas specialize on fast processing of sensory inputs [5–7], whereas higher ( transmodal ) areas perform temporal processing with long timescales—combining new information with past information that is maintained over extended periods . This hierarchy is reflected by an increase in the intrinsic timescale of neural activity, as measured by the decay rate of autocorrelation [4, 10–12]. In addition, intrinsic timescales were found to be indicative of the specialization for behaviorally relevant computations [13–16]. Finally, there exist gradients in intra-areal properties across the anatomical cortical hierarchy, all of which point to a stronger recurrent coupling for areas specialized on long timescales . In particular, higher cortical areas have an increased dendritic spine density for pyramidal neurons , overall excitation-inhibition ratio , the expression of related receptor genes , gray matter myelination , and the strength of functional connectivity . From modelling studies, a stronger recurrence is known to enable stronger and longer-lasting activity fluctuations [15, 25–27], consistent with the increase in timescales for higher areas. Overall, this led to the understanding that in primates, temporal processing is organized hierarchically , and that specializations along this hierarchy are likely governed by differences in recurrent coupling . Yet, it is still open how a temporal hierarchy shaped by recurrence fulfills requirements of neural coding and information processing, and whether it manifests as a general organization principle in mammals. Here, we investigate mouse visual cortex because it comprises an anatomical and functional sensory processing hierarchy that differs from primate visual cortex in many interesting ways .

[ABSTRACT] Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications, but the neural circuits that are engaged during TMS are still poorly understood. Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to TMS, and therefore a new opportunity to model neural circuit dynamics. The study goal was to use epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn through which the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves, could be investigated. An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways, and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways. Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves. Single wave preference could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and L5 pyramidal tract neurons ( PTNs ). For these activations, the total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave. Finally, there were multiple neuron type activations that could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave. The results support the idea that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, activation of both afferents to the motor cortex as well as specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves, and the results were interpreted to propose the cortical origins of afferents that may give rise to certain I-waves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to both identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) can non-invasively activate superficial cortical regions to study brain functions, treat psychiatric and neurological disorders, and collect diagnostic biomarkers . However, improving methodologies and developing new applications remain slow and challenging due to the uncertainties about what is activated by TMS and how this activation courses through the circuits within and beyond the stimulated region . One approach to understanding these network effects in the motor cortex is via descending volleys of activity that propagate to the spinal cord in response to TMS and can be recorded epidurally as transient corticospinal waves ( Fig 1 ). The corticospinal waves represent the activity of layer 5b pyramidal tract neurons ( PTNs ) that send axons into the spinal cord . The shortest latency direct wave ( D-wave ) is widely agreed to represent the direct activation of PTNs . Subsequent waves are called indirect waves ( I-waves ) and likely represent transsynaptic activations of PTNs resulting from the initial direct activation of PTNS, axons of afferents, and other neuron types.

[ABSTRACT] Cell-free placental DNA ( cfpDNA ) is present in maternal circulation during gestation. CfpDNA carries great potential as a research and clinical tool as it provides a means to investigate the placental ( epi ) genome across gestation, which previously required invasive placenta sampling procedures. CfpDNA has been widely implemented in the clinical setting for noninvasive prenatal testing ( NIPT ). Despite this, the basic biology of cfpDNA remains poorly understood, limiting the research and clinical utility of cfpDNA. This review will examine the current knowledge of cfpDNA, including origins and molecular characteristics, highlight gaps in knowledge, and discuss future research directions. Cell-free placental DNA ( cfpDNA ) is shed into maternal circulation throughout pregnancy . CfpDNA has been detected as early as the fourth week of gestation and has been estimated to comprise up to approximately 40% of total maternal plasma cell-free DNA [2–4]. Since its discovery in 1997, cfpDNA has been used in the clinical setting for noninvasive prenatal testing ( NIPT ) to screen for fetal genetic aberrations, most notably chromosomal aneuploidies. However, the understanding of the basic biology underlying cfpDNA remains limited, placing constraints on the information that can be obtained from analyzing cfpDNA. Gaps in knowledge include cfpDNA fragmentation processes, release mechanisms, form, and function. CfpDNA carries the potential for real-time study and monitoring of placental health and development. Further characterization of physical, genetic, and epigenetic characteristics of cfpDNA will pave the way for further basic research and clinical applications. In this review, we will examine the current understanding of cfpDNA, highlight gaps in knowledge, and discuss future research directions ( Fig 1 ). While this review focuses on pregnancy, much of what is discussed applies to the cell-free DNA field in general, including other clinical contexts such as cancer. The placenta is a transient organ that forms during gestation. It facilitates the exchange of molecules between the fetal and maternal bloodstreams to support the physiological needs of the developing feto-placental unit. The placenta arises from the trophectoderm layer of the blastocyst, which further differentiates into cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, and extravillous trophoblasts . Trophoblasts invade and reconstruct the innermost layer of the uterus, the endometrium ( Fig 2A ). Within the decidua, the differentiated and reconstructed layer of the endometrium, the invading trophoblasts develop into tree-like projections called chorionic villi ( Fig 2B ). Chorionic villi are composed of an inner stromal core and outer trophoblast layer . Mesenchymal cells in the stromal core form capillaries which circulate fetal blood from the umbilical blood vessels . The spaces between chorionic villi form the intervillous space which is eventually filled with maternal blood. Extravillous trophoblasts invade and remodel uterine spiral arteries, veins, and glands in the endometrium to establish maternal blood circulation and glandular secretion in the intervillous space . Maternal blood circulation to the intervillous space is initially blocked by trophoblast plugs in the uterine vessels.

[ABSTRACT] Hormone-dependent cancers ( HDCs ) share several risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology. Using data from genome-wide association studies, we showed spatial clustering of risk variants across four HDCs ( breast, endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers ), contrasting with genetically uncorrelated traits. We identified 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs: two regions contained risk variants for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDCs and 28 for two HDCs. Integrating GWAS data, epigenomic profiling and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models, we annotated 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions. These targets were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles. Additionally, we pinpointed lncRNAs as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factors motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes, implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or helped the repurposing of existing treatments for HDC. Our approach provides a framework for identifying common target genes driving complex traits and enhances understanding of HDC susceptibility. Breast, endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers are hormone-dependent cancers ( HDCs ) that together account for up to 30% of new cancer diagnoses each year . These cancers share several environmental, behavioural and genetic risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology . This premise is supported by genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) which have identified hundreds of cancer-specific risk loci [4–7] and multiple pleiotropic loci associated with at least two HDCs [8–11]. The detection of pleiotropic loci suggests that shared genetic factors likely contribute to polygenic risk of HDCs and raises the possibility of common driver genes and biological pathways. A key aim of post-GWAS is to identify the target gene ( s ) that are affected at each GWAS region. This is complicated by the fact that most risk variants reside in noncoding regions of the genome making it difficult to interpret how they contribute to cancer susceptibility . Target gene mapping for pleiotropic loci typically relies on statistical approaches such as expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL ) and transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) . However, these methods are limited by small sample sizes which reduces power, the use of steady-state gene expression and the lack of data from relevant tissues. Orthologous functional assays provide complementary mapping approaches to better define regulatory variants and connect them to their target genes. While most GWAS variants are dispersed across the genome, several genomic regions harbour variants for multiple cancer types, suggesting common target gene ( s ) may drive these associations. Independent signals for HDC were obtained from large-scale GWAS, meta-analyses and fine-mapping ( 196 breast , 17 endometrial , 60 ovarian and 258 prostate cancer index variants ).

[ABSTRACT] Recently we characterized polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog. The familial occurrence of the disease were suggestive of an inherited cause. Here we report the results of our molecular genetic investigation. A genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls indicated the involvement of a region on chromosome CFA19 ( p = 4. 7*10−10 ). Haplotype analysis indicated that the cases shared a 2. 9 Mb region in the homozygous or the heterozygous state. Next Generation Sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment, located 10 kb upstream of the neighbouring interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The frequency of the deletion allele was 0. 81 in the available cases and 0. 25 in a random sample of the Kooiker dog breed. Leukocytes of affected, untreated dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpress IL21 and IL2 upon stimulation with mitogens. We suggest that elements located 10–49 kb upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play an important role in the regulation of the canine genes and that deletion of these elements is a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs. Postulating causality, the penetrance of the disease phenotype was estimated at 10–20% for homozygous dogs and 0. 5–2% for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion. Our results suggest that distant variants upstream of IL21 could also be important for human autoimmune diseases that have been found to be associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region. An autoimmune-mediated inflammatory myopathy ( IM ) was seen with increasing frequency in the breed of Nederlandse Kooikerhondjes, named Kooiker dogs hereafter . The dogs presented with locomotion problems with or without dysphagia. Serum creatine kinase activity was almost invariably elevated, and histopathology of available muscle biopsies revealed predominantly lymphohistiocytic infiltration usually showing a low and variable number of eosinophils, neutrophils and plasma cells . Detailed pathological investigation and immunological characterization of cellular infiltrates were indicative of polymyositis ( PM ) . The condition occurred more often in the Kooiker dog breed than in other breeds and littermates of affected dogs appeared to be at increased risk for developing PM. Therefore, a genetic background was suspected. Dog breeds in general have been established with a small number of founders, are therefore genetically homogeneous and excellent sources for molecular research of monogenic and polygenic traits [3–6]. Inherited causes of distinct forms of IM have been investigated in Vizsla dogs, Boxers, Newfoundland dogs, Dutch shepherd dogs, Shetland sheepdogs and Collies [7–10]. One haplotype of MHC class II genes appeared to be a risk factor for PM in Vizsla dogs . Another MHC class II haplotype was associated with dermatomyositis in the related breeds of Shetland sheepdogs and Collies . Additional risk variants in these two breeds were recognized in the genes PAN2 and MAP3K7CL, and the risk of dermatomyositis increased with the total number of risk alleles carried by the dogs.

[ABSTRACT] Protein stability plays a crucial role in a variety of applications, such as food processing, therapeutics, and the identification of pathogenic mutations. Engineering campaigns commonly seek to improve protein stability, and there is a strong interest in streamlining these processes to enable rapid optimization of highly stabilized proteins with fewer iterations. In this work, we explore utilizing a mega-scale dataset to develop a protein language model optimized for stability prediction. ESMtherm is trained on the folding stability of 528k natural and de novo sequences derived from 461 protein domains and can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. We show that a protein language model can be fine-tuned to predict folding stability. ESMtherm performs reasonably on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. Lastly, we discuss our model’s limitations compared to other state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds. Our results highlight the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature. Protein stability is one of the foundations of protein engineering to design resilient proteins for industrial processes and therapeutic manufacturing [1–3]. Beyond protein engineering, destabilizing mutations are associated with pathogenicity, and stability predictors can help identify pathogenic mutations across human proteome [4–7]. Molecular modeling methods, including Rosetta , FoldX , and molecular dynamics simulations , have been shown to predict the impact of mutation on protein stability. More recently, the use of machine learning models grounded in biophysical features and evolutionary statistics [12–20] has offered an alternative approach to stability and function prediction without the need for computationally intensive molecular modeling simulations. Fueled by the latest advances in deep learning, convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) and graph neural networks ( GNNs ) are now being adopted to predict mutational impacts on stability by operating directly on the input protein structure . For example, RaSP is a CNN-based model trained on top of Rosetta , while ELASPIC-2, another stability predictor, operates on both sequence embedding from ESM and structural embedding from GNN [26–28]. Despite these advancements, the lack of a consistent and universal dataset remains an obstacle. While merging smaller datasets into a more comprehensive collection, such as ProTherm , ProtaBank and ThermoMutDB , is a feasible approach, combined datasets often consist of closely related but distinct quantities accompanied by additional discrepancies in experimental conditions. While deep mutagenesis scanning ( DMS ) offers profound insights, these studies typically focus on a single protein target, limiting the broader applicability of the derived data and models then trained on these datasets. In light of these challenges, Tsuboyama et al. introduced a mega-scale thermostability dataset, encompassing 776k short protein sequences derived from 479 small protein domains, all consistently evaluated using the same assay . Utilizing this dataset, we fine-tuned a protein language model ( pLM ), named ESMtherm, from ESM-2 to act as an end-to-end stability predictor.

[ABSTRACT] Inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ) are a family of inhibitory receptors that are expressed by natural killer ( NK ) cells and late-stage differentiated T cells. There is accumulating evidence that iKIRs regulate T cell-mediated immunity. Recently, we reported that T cell-mediated control was enhanced by iKIRs in chronic viral infections. We hypothesized that in the context of autoimmunity, where an enhanced T cell response might be considered detrimental, iKIRs would have an opposite effect. We studied Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) as a paradigmatic example of autoimmunity. In T1D, variation in the Human Leucocyte Antigen ( HLA ) genes explains up to 50% of the genetic risk, indicating that T cells have a major role in T1D etiopathogenesis. To investigate if iKIRs affect this T cell response, we asked whether HLA associations were modified by iKIR genes. We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1D dataset ( N = 11, 961 ) and found that iKIR genes, in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, have a consistent and significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations. Our results were validated in an independent data set. We conclude that iKIRs significantly decrease HLA class II protective associations and suggest that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D. Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by insulin-deficiency due to the destruction of insulin-producing islet β-cells. The exact aetiology of T1D remains elusive, but environmental triggers are thought to initiate the break in peripheral tolerance in genetically susceptible individuals. The largest genetic contributors to susceptibility to T1D are the human leucocyte antigen ( HLA ) genes . Within the HLA region, the closely linked classical class II HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 genes display the strongest associations indicating that CD4+ T cells have a major role in T1D etiopathogenesis. In particular, DRB1*04:01/02/04/05-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02 and DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01 haplotypes are associated with the highest T1D susceptibility whereas DRB1*15:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 is associated with dominant protection . Here we study a family of inhibitory receptors called inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ). iKIRs are expressed predominantly on natural killer ( NK ) cells and, at a lower frequency, on late stage differentiated T cells. The ligands of iKIRs are HLA class I molecules which they bind in broad allele groups, e. g. KIR3DL1 binds HLA-B alleles with a Bw4 motif at positions 77–83 . The iKIR genes and the genes encoding their HLA class I ligands are located on different chromosomes and so are inherited independently. Consequently, it is common for individuals to have one or more iKIRs without the corresponding ligand; if an individual is positive for a given iKIR as well as the matching ligand we refer to that iKIR as “functional”. iKIRs play a major role in regulating innate NK cell-mediated responses but there is increasing evidence that iKIRs also modulate adaptive T cell responses [5–7].

[ABSTRACT] Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ( FECD ) is an age-related cause of vision loss, and the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans characterised to date. Up to 80% of European FECD cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element ( termed CTG18. 1 ) located within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene, TCF4. The non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4 have made it extremely challenging to experimentally decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. Here we comprehensively describe CTG18. 1 expansion-driven molecular components of disease within primary patient-derived corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ), generated from a large cohort of individuals with CTG18. 1-expanded ( Exp+ ) and CTG 18. 1-independent ( Exp- ) FECD. We employ long-read, short-read, and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific transcriptomic biomarkers. Interrogation of long-read sequencing and alternative splicing analysis of short-read transcriptomic data together reveals the global extent of altered splicing occurring within Exp+ FECD, and unique transcripts associated with CTG18. 1-expansions. Similarly, differential gene expression analysis highlights the total transcriptomic consequences of Exp+ FECD within CECs. Furthermore, differential exon usage, pathway enrichment and spatial transcriptomics reveal TCF4 isoform ratio skewing solely in Exp+ FECD with potential downstream functional consequences. Lastly, exome data from 134 Exp- FECD cases identified rare ( minor allele frequency <0. 005 ) and potentially deleterious ( CADD>15 ) TCF4 variants in 7/134 FECD Exp- cases, suggesting that TCF4 variants independent of CTG18. 1 may increase FECD risk. In summary, our study supports the idea that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, both underpin the pathophysiology of FECD. We anticipate these data will inform and guide the development of translational interventions for this common triplet-repeat mediated disease. Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ( FECD ) is a common, age-related, and visually disabling disease that represents a leading indication for corneal transplantation in high-income countries ) . It primarily affects the corneal endothelium, a monolayer of post-mitotic cells on the posterior corneal surface that function to maintain relative corneal dehydration. As the disease progresses, collagenous excrescences ( guttae ) form on the thickened corneal endothelial basement membrane ( Descemet membrane ) and corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ) undergo accelerated cell death, which results in corneal oedema and opacity . Affected individuals typically experience symptoms in their 5th to 6th decade, with glare, reduced contrast sensitivity, and blurred vision . Transplantation of donor endothelial tissue is the preferred treatment for cases with visually significant symptoms. However, given an increasing societal burden of age-related disease coupled with a global shortage of suitable donor tissue, there is a pressing clinical need for alternative treatments . Up to 80% of FECD cases of European descent have one or more expanded copies of a CTG trinucleotide repeat element located within an intronic region of the transcription factor gene 4, TCF4 .

[ABSTRACT] Direct seeding is employed to circumvent the labor-intensive process of rice ( Oryza sativa ) transplantation, but this approach requires varieties with vigorous low-temperature germination ( LTG ) when sown in cold climates. To investigate the genetic basis of LTG, we identified the quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) qLTG11 from rice variety Arroz da Terra, which shows rapid seed germination at lower temperatures, using QTL-seq. We delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h ( GF14h ) gene, which is expressed during seed germination. The Arroz da Terra GF14h allele encodes functional GF14h, whereas Japanese rice variety Hitomebore harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line ( NIL ) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG, whereas overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG, indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11. Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost from popular varieties during modern breeding. We generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra including GF14h. The NIL showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore, with otherwise comparable agronomic traits. The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions. Low-temperature seed germination ( LTG ) is a pivotal agronomic trait in rice ( Oryza sativa ). As rice originated from tropical and subtropical regions, it is highly susceptible to low-temperature conditions compared to other cereal crops such as wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) . Nevertheless, rice is produced in temperate and high-altitude regions, where it frequently experiences temperatures below 20°C. In Japan, rice is abundantly cultivated in relatively cold areas such as Tohoku and Hokkaido. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand to shift from conventional transplantation-based rice cultivation to direct seeding to reduce labor and costs. However, direct seeding raises the risk of exposure to low temperatures during seed germination . Therefore, to expand the use of direct seeding, it is crucial to breed rice cultivars with enhanced LTG. LTG is a quantitative trait regulated by complex molecular mechanisms. Linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified over 30 LTG-related quantitative trait loci ( QTLs ) or genomic regions associated with this trait, located on all 12 rice chromosomes [3–20]. However, only a few genes involved in LTG have been described, such as qLTG3-1 and STRESS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN16 ( OsSAP16 ) . The qLTG3-1 gene, encoding a protein of unknown function, has a substantial influence on LTG . During seed germination, qLTG3-1 expression is strongly induced in embryos, which leads to the loosening of the tissues covering the embryo by promoting vacuolation . OsSAP16 encodes a stress-associated protein with two AN1-C2H2 zinc finger domains . OsSAP16 presumably acts as a regulator of LTG.

[ABSTRACT] Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) possesses an 8–9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy ( TR, or r ) on the negative ( - ) strand DNA derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ). It remains unclear whether the TR forms a 5’ or 3’ flap structure on HBV rcDNA and which TR copy is removed during covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) formation. To address these questions, a mutant HBV cell line HepDES-C1822G was established with a C1822G mutation in the pgRNA coding sequence, altering the sequence of 3’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA while the 5’ TR remained wild type ( wt ). The production of HBV rcDNA and cccDNA in HepDES-C1822G cells was comparable to wt levels. Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) analysis revealed that the positive ( + ) strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wt nt1822 residue, indicating that the 5’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the ( + ) strand DNA, while the 3’ TR forms a flap-like structure, which is then removed during cccDNA formation. In a survey of known cellular flap endonucleases using a loss-of-function study, we found that the 3’ flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells, alongside the 5’ flap endonuclease FEN1. Additionally, we have mapped the potential Mus81 and FEN1 cleavage sites within the TR of nuclear DP-rcDNA by RACE-NGS analyses. The overlapping function between Mus81 and FEN1 in cccDNA formation indicates that the putative 5’ and 3’ flap formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursor. These findings shed light on HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of HBV replication cycle. Human hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by hepatitis B virus ( HBV ), which can cause chronic infection and puts people at high-risk occurrence of cirrhosis and deadly hepatocellular carcinoma . 296 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B in 2019, with an estimated 820, 000 deaths and 1. 5 million new infections each year . While hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination, individuals who are already chronically infected with HBV are difficult to cure . HBV is the prototype member of the Hepadnaviridae family and a para-retrovirus that replicates its DNA genome via reverse transcription of the pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) encoded by viral covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ), which is the persistent form of HBV genome and the authentic transcription template in HBV-infected hepatocyte .

[ABSTRACT] The efficiency of microbial fuel cells ( MFCs ) in industrial wastewater treatment is profoundly influenced by the microbial community, which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations. Although microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified, comprehensive knowledge of the convergent community structure and pathways of adaptation is lacking. Here, we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model ( mmGEM ) based on metabolic cross-feeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory. The metabolic model encompassed three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria ( SRB ), methanogens ( MET ), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria ( SOB ). Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates ( OLRs ) increased, along with a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs ( L-OLRs ) and adaptation to high OLRs ( H-OLRs ). The simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide ( S ) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. More cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance. Assessing cross-feeding dynamics under varying OLRs enabled the execution of practical scenario-based simulations to explore the potential impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance. This work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs. The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments. Microbial fuel cells ( MFCs ) are an ideal technological solution to support zero-waste practices within the concept of a circular economy . This technology exploits microbial activities to extract electrons from the breakdown of waste biomass. These electrons can be released to anode electrode and then flow to cathode electrode for completing the circuit and generating electricity . MFCs offer distinct advantages over existing green technologies such as anaerobic digestion, including the ability to directly convert organic wastes into electricity, the capability to remove toxic residues, and the production of less-polluting effluents . Thus, MFCs can complement the anaerobic digestion process or serve as an alternative green technology for waste treatment across diverse industries . A recent study on the application of MFCs in wastewater treatment systems within the canned-pineapple industry underlines the practicality of this technology in real-world scenarios. The MFCs system showed great performances in chemical oxygen demand ( COD ) removal, sulfide removal, and in current generation with organic- and sulfide-containing wastewater . Nonetheless, the performance of MFCs is often hindered by microbial activity destabilization when exposed to fluctuating conditions of real-world industrial operations . The variable nature of organic substrates in wastewater profoundly influences the microbial dynamics within MFCs, including the composition, metabolic functions, and interrelationships among microbial guilds, thereby ultimately impacting their performance.

[ABSTRACT] Machine learning ( ML ) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. In those applications, ML models are used to predict the properties of biological systems, and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates as new biological hypotheses for downstream experimental validations. However, when applied to unseen situations, these models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. One solution to address this issue is to quantify the model’s prediction uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate ( FDR ) pre-specified by researchers. We propose CPEC, an ML framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery. We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool known as conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme. Conformal prediction provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model and ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. We expect CPEC to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited. Machine learning ( ML ) algorithms have proven to be transformative tools for generating biological hypotheses and uncovering knowledge from large datasets . Applications include designing function-enhanced proteins , searching for new drug molecules , and optimizing human antibodies against new viral variants . These discoveries often involve a combination of computation and experimentation, where ML-based predictive models generate biological hypotheses and wet-lab experiments are then used to validate them. This approach is beneficial as it greatly reduces the search space and eliminates candidates that are unlikely to be successful, thus saving time and resources in the discovery process. For example, in drug discovery, ML has become a popular strategy for virtual screening of molecule libraries, where researchers use ML models to predict the properties of molecules, such as binding affinity to a target, and identify the most promising candidates for downstream experimental validation and lead optimization . To gain new insights into biological systems or make new discoveries ( e. g., designing new drugs ), ML algorithms are often used to make predictions for previously unseen data samples. For example, to support the design of new vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19, ML algorithms need to predict the potential for immune escape of future variants that are composed of mutations that have not yet been seen. Similarly, in drug screening, ML algorithms should be able to predict molecules that are structurally different from those in the training data, which helps scientists avoid re-discovering existing drugs.

[ABSTRACT] Neuronal inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 are hallmarks of disease for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ). Mutations in TARDBP, the gene coding for TDP-43, can cause some cases of familial inherited ALS ( fALS ), indicating dysfunction of TDP-43 drives disease. Aggregated, phosphorylated TDP-43 may contribute to disease phenotypes; alternatively, TDP-43 aggregation may be a protective cellular response sequestering toxic protein away from the rest of the cell. The heat shock responsive chaperone Hsp90 has been shown to interact with TDP-43 and stabilize its normal conformation; however, it is not known whether this interaction contributes to neurotoxicity in vivo. Using a C. elegans model of fALS mutant TDP-43 proteinopathy, we find that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against TDP-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult animals. This protection is accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein. We also find that hsp-90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress responsive heat shock pathway gene expression, including hsp-70 and hsp-16. 1, and we demonstrate that normal levels of hsp-16. 1 are required for hsp-90 mutation effects on TDP-43. We also observe that the neuroprotective effect due to HSP-90 dysfunction does not involve direct regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. Our data demonstrate for the first time that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a highly disabling disease characterized by the progressive loss of upper cortical and lower spinal motor neurons. Loss of motor neurons is accompanied by muscle denervation, causing weakness, spasticity, and finally, paralysis, which can lead to fatal respiratory failure typically within 3–5 years after diagnosis . Most patients with ALS have a sporadic form of the disease with no known genetic cause. However, there are currently more than 30 gene mutations thought to cause familial inherited forms of ALS . Similar to other neurodegenerative proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease, ALS exhibits accumulation of neurotoxic misfolded proteins in disease affected regions of the central nervous system . The vast majority of both sporadic and familial ALS-diagnosed cases ( about 97% ) present inclusions containing the protein TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa ( TDP-43 ) in degenerating neurons, thus constituting the main pathological hallmark of the disease. TDP-43 is an essential protein contributing to many aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA splicing regulation and RNA processing . TDP-43 protein levels are tightly controlled through a negative feedback loop, in which TDP-43 recognizes its own RNA transcript and destabilizes it, thus reducing TDP-43 protein production . Under physiological conditions, this protein resides primarily in the nucleus but can be transported into the cytoplasm, where it contributes to RNA stability and transport.

[ABSTRACT] Our understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the Arthropod female reproductive system and the extent of their conservation is currently very limited. This is due to the focus on model systems, including Drosophila and Daphnia, which do not reflect the observed diversity of morphologies, reproductive modes, and sex chromosome systems. We use single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to produce a comprehensive single nucleus atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system. We map our data to the Fly Cell Atlas single-nucleus dataset of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, shedding light on the conserved regulatory programs between the two distantly related Arthropod species. We identify the major cell types known to be present in the Artemia ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and ovarian muscle cells. Additionally, we use the germ cells to explore gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis, highlighting its unique regulatory dynamics and allowing us to explore the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group. Most animals have evolved sexually dimorphic mechanisms and tissues dedicated to the production of haploid gametes through meiosis ( gametogenesis ). Males produce motile nuclei ( sperm ) through spermatogenesis, which takes place in the testes. Females produce oocytes that contain a haploid nucleus along with the cytoplasmic molecules needed to initiate and helped embryonic development through oogenesis, which takes place in the ovaries . While many aspects of oogenesis and female meiosis are highly conserved between distant species, there is considerable diversity in many others, including the presence/absence of nurse cells, meiotic chromosome pairing strategies, recombination rates, timing and duration of meiotic arrests, and sex chromosome specific regulation [1–3]. Why such a fundamental and ancient process exhibits so much variation is still unclear. Studying species with diverse body plans, reproductive modes, and sex chromosome systems at the genetic and molecular levels will help explained the developmental constraints and selective pressures that shaped the evolution of the conserved, convergent and divergent features of oogenesis. As the hallmark of oogenesis, meiosis is very tightly regulated and many mechanisms have evolved to ensure the faithful transmission of genetic information to the offspring through the proper pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes . In addition to ensuring the fidelity of the transmitted genome copy and building the maternal reserves to kick-start the embryo’s journey, oogenesis involves extensive reprogramming of the epigenetic landscape to ensure a successful oocyte-to-embryo transition upon fertilization . To accomplish those feats, oocytes actively navigate previtellogenesis and the majority of prophase I before they arrest and become transcriptionally quiescent. The prophase I arrest is thought to be essential for oocyte growth and differentiation, and is conserved across metazoans, but with highly variable durations . In many arthropods, the lack of transcription in the oocyte is buffered by the activity of nurse cells that remain connected to the oocyte through cytoplasmic bridges .

[ABSTRACT] Chronic pain is a wide-spread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States alone around $600 billion in 2010. In a common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia, non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with highly variable presentations across individuals. While the specific mechanisms remain unclear, allodynia is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory ( E-I ) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In this work, we analyze biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn. These circuits are hypothesized to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two different types of allodynia: static and dynamic. We use neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit. By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions, we specify model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions. Then, we implement a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit’s E-I signaling. We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling so that excitatory neurons are “released” from inhibitory control, or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses so that excitatory neurons “escape” their inhibitory control. Which of these mechanisms is most likely to occur, the subcircuit components involved in the process, and the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the process can vary depending on the subcircuit structure. These results suggest specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia, thus offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom. Here, we describe subcircuit motifs that reflect recent experimental evidence for the structure of dorsal horn laminae I-II networks mediating static allodynia ( as evoked by a von Frey device ) and dynamic allodynia ( Fig 1A ). Experimental studies in rodents have shown that static allodynia is reliant on activity in three putatively different types of laminae I-II excitatory interneurons: somatostatin-positive ( SOM+ ) , calretinin-positive ( CR+ ) , and protein kinase C γ-positive ( PKCγ+ ) cells. Additionally, inactivation of either dynorphin-positive ( DYN+ ) or parvalbumin-positive ( PV+ ) inhibitory interneurons is sufficient to produce static allodynia, suggesting that these inhibitory cells usually gate activation of SOM+, CR+ and PKCγ+ excitatory cells. Experiments have also identified direct synaptic connections from PV+ to PKCγ+ neurons . Based on these experimental results, we consider a simplified subcircuit motif representing part of the pathway mediating static allodynia that consists of three neural populations ( Fig 1B ). One population, E, represents the collective activity of laminae I-II SOM+, CR+ and PKCγ+ excitatory interneurons.

[ABSTRACT] Protein homeostasis relies on the accurate translation and folding of newly synthesized proteins. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ( eEF2 ) promotes GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during translation. eEF2 folding was recently shown to be dependent on Hsp90 as well as the cochaperones Hgh1, Cns1, and Cpr7. We examined the requirement for Hsp90 and cochaperones more closely and found that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two distinct roles in regulating eEF2 function. Yeast expressing one group of Hsp90 mutations or one group of cochaperone mutations had reduced steady-state levels of eEF2. The growth of Hsp90 mutants that affected eEF2 accumulation was also negatively affected by deletion of the gene encoding Hgh1. Further, mutations in yeast eEF2 that mimic disease-associated mutations in human eEF2 were negatively impacted by loss of Hgh1 and growth of one mutant was partially rescued by overexpression of Hgh1. In contrast, yeast expressing different groups of Hsp90 mutations or a different cochaperone mutation had altered sensitivity to diphtheria toxin, which is dictated by a unique posttranslational modification on eEF2. Our results provide further evidence that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not just by assisting protein folding, but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. In addition, these results provide further evidence that yeast Hsp90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochaperones. The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is required for maintaining up to 20% of the yeast proteome in an active, folded conformation [1–5]. Hsp90 functions as a dimer and undergoes dramatic nucleotide-induced conformational changes . The most complete model of Hsp90 function is based on the ATP-dependent cycle of interaction with glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) [7–10]. Unfolded GR progresses through a loading complex consisting of Hsp70, Hsp90, and Sti1/Hop to a mature complex of GR, Hsp90, and the Sba1/p23 and FKBP52 cochaperones. Once in the mature complex, the GR achieves the ability to bind hormone with high affinity. Cryo-EM structures of Hsp90 and cochaperones in complex with GR demonstrate that each cochaperone makes direct contact with the GR, providing the basis for cochaperone-client selectivity [11–13]. However, evidence suggests GR and/or other clients may use a variety of mechanisms that include different cochaperones capable of targeting clients to Hsp90 [14–18]. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that clients interact with different subsets of cochaperones, and some cochaperones form functional networks . There are about twelve Hsp90 cochaperones in yeast and fifty in humans . One of our goals is to identify differences in how clients interact with Hsp90 and cochaperones to provide insight into potential mechanisms of selective inhibition of Hsp90 function. The two isoforms of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 ( encoded by HSC82 and HSP82 ) are 97% identical. Yeast eEF2 ( encoded by EFT1 and EFT2 ) consists of two isoforms that are 100% identical . Both proteins are very abundant, with estimates of ~229, 000 polypeptides of Hsc82/Hsp82 per cell and 145, 000 polypeptides of Eft1/Eft2 .

[ABSTRACT] When making risky choices in social contexts, humans typically combine social information with individual preferences about the options at stake. It remains unknown how such decisions are made when these preferences are inaccessible or disrupted, as might be the case for individuals confronting new options or experiencing cognitive impairment. Thus, we examined participants with lesions in insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, key regions implicated in risky decision-making, as they played a gambling task where choices were made both alone and after observing others’ choices. Participants in both lesion groups showed disrupted use of standard utility-based computations about risky options. For socially situated decisions, these participants showed increased conformity with the choices of others, independent from social utility-based computations. These findings suggest that in social contexts, following others’ choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted. In social contexts, decision-makers sometimes follow a crowd despite their own preferences toward a different course of action . This effect has been documented in various forms in humans and in nonhuman primates . Recent studies indicate that when making socially situated choices, humans combine individual preferences for the options at stake with individual valuation of social information; contributions from each of these determine when choices made in a social context diverge ( or not ) from that which one’s preferences outside a social context would predict [5–11]. These previous studies have largely focused on understanding how social information contributes to choices with respect to individuals’ preferences about risk. Here, we investigated how risky decisions in social contexts are made when utility-based risk preferences are disrupted or inaccessible, as might be the case for individuals with certain psychopathologies or who are confronting new options ( e. g., Gershman & Niv ). Specifically, previous literature on decision-making in humans and non-human primates indicates that when individuals have a limited amount of private information, they tend to use various cognitive shortcuts or heuristics ( e. g., mimicking other agents ) to simplify decision processes [13–16]. In the current study, we use a risky decision-making task and examine whether such heuristics helped socially situated decision-making about risk when utility processing is disrupted. Previous work has shown that individual preferences and information from others are combined during risky decision-making under social influence . Neurally, the insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices ( dACC ) have been shown to encode an interaction between one’s own risk preference and information from others. As such, these regions show greater hemodynamic responses when an individual’s preference differs from the observed choices of others . The insula and dACC have also been consistently implicated in decision-making about risky options in non-social contexts, via lesion ( insula only ), functional neuroimaging ( insula and dACC ), and electrophysiology ( insula ) studies [18–23].

[ABSTRACT] Biomorphs, Richard Dawkins’s iconic model of morphological evolution, are traditionally used to demonstrate the power of natural selection to generate biological order from random mutations. Here we show that biomorphs can also be used to illustrate how developmental bias shapes adaptive evolutionary outcomes. In particular, we find that biomorphs exhibit phenotype bias, a type of developmental bias where certain phenotypes can be many orders of magnitude more likely than others to appear through random mutations. Moreover, this bias exhibits a strong preference for simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity. Such bias towards simplicity is formalised by an information-theoretic principle that can be intuitively understood from a picture of evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms. By using population genetics simulations, we demonstrate how moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently upon random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. This result, as well as many other patterns found in the structure of variation for the biomorphs, such as high mutational robustness and a positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness, closely resemble findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps. Many of these patterns can be explained with an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome. We postulate that the phenotype bias towards simplicity and other patterns biomorphs share with molecular genotype-phenotype maps may hold more widely for developmental systems. In his influential book, The Blind Watchmaker , Richard Dawkins’s illustrates how natural selection can efficiently find fitness maxima in ‘hyper-astronomically large’ search spaces by introducing an intriguing twist on the famous infinite monkey theorem. He frames his argument by first introducing the classic case ( see Fig 1 ) with a question: How likely is it that a monkey randomly typing on a typewriter produces Hamlet’s 28-character phrase “METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL” ? For a monkey typing on an M-key typewriter, the probability to produce a specific string of n characters will scale as 1/Mn, which rapidly becomes unimaginably small with increasing n. By analogy, random mutations on their own are unlikely to produce meaningful biological novelty. Dawkins’s contrasts this picture with his second version of the infinite monkey theorem, where a fitness function acts on each letter independently. The output stops changing once the correct letter is found, so that on average only M random keystrokes are needed for each letter. Thus, any n letter phrase can be produced in a number of keystrokes that scales as n × M, which is exponentially smaller than in the first case. This simple but evocative example illustrates an important property of biological sequence spaces. For a given alphabet size M, their size grows exponentially with sequence length L as ML, but genomic distances remain linear in L because on the order of L mutations can be used to link any two sequences.

[ABSTRACT] Activities like ball bouncing and trampoline jumping showcase the human ability to intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that the system prefers intrinsically. This human sensitivity to resonance has been experimentally supported for interactions with simple linear systems but remains a challenge to validate in more complex scenarios where nonlinear dynamics cannot be predicted analytically. However, it has been found that many nonlinear systems exhibit periodic orbits similar to the eigenmodes of linear systems. These nonlinear normal modes ( NNM ) are computable with a recently developed numerical mode tool. Using this tool, the present resarch compared the motions that humans excite in nonlinear systems with the predicted NNM of the energy-conservative systems. In a user study consisting of three experiment parts, participants commanded differently configured virtual double pendula with joint compliance through a haptic joystick. The task was to alternately hit two targets, which were either aligned with the NNM ( Experiments 1 and 2 ) or purposefully arranged offset ( Experiment 3 ). In all tested experiment variations, participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems. Even for increased task accuracy ( Experiment 2 ) and targets located away from the NNM ( Experiment 3 ), participants could successfully accomplish the task, likely by adjusting their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics to better align the resonant motions to the task. Consequently, our experiments extend the existing research on human resonance sensitivity with data-based evidence to nonlinear systems. Our findings emphasize the human capabilities to apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions, including possibly shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness. Humans exhibit remarkable dexterity and versatility while using their upper limbs for daily activities. We can easily handle countless different objects, even when they are complex in shape, flexible in material, have multiple degrees of freedom ( DOFs ), or exhibit highly nonlinear or even chaotic dynamic behavior. In fact, studies show that humans can partially follow and learn to predict chaotic system behavior. It is likely that the Central Nervous System ( CNS ) also employs chaotic control to explore system dynamics and tune into intrinsic motion patterns to excite resonant behavior . This enables orchestrating numerous DOFs together, reducing the needed control effort. Everyday examples showcase human intuitive resonance sensitivity: without conscious effort, humans induce oscillatory motions when jumping on a trampoline or bouncing a ball by tuning to the intrinsic system dynamics . This excites the resonant frequency, which appears to be more predictable for humans . Predictability facilitates forming an internal model of objects and their dynamic behavior in interactions [9–12]. By learning and internalizing physical object models, humans can anticipate system motions, enabling anticipatory control strategies that leverage this knowledge [13–15]. Experiments have suggested that predictability becomes a priority for human control in rhythmic movement tasks.

[ABSTRACT] Regulation of transcription is a fundamental process that allows bacteria to respond to external stimuli with appropriate timing and magnitude of response. In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcriptional regulation is at the core of developmental processes needed for cell survival. Gene expression in cells transitioning from exponential phase to stationary phase is under the control of a group of transcription factors called transition state regulators ( TSRs ). TSRs influence numerous developmental processes including the decision between biofilm formation and motility, genetic competence, and sporulation, but the extent to which TSRs influence bacterial physiology remains to be fully explained. Here, we demonstrate two TSRs, ScoC and AbrB, along with the MarR-family transcription factor PchR negatively regulate production of the iron chelator pulcherrimin in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis of the relationship between the three transcription factors indicate that all are necessary to limit pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced. Similarly, expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC was found to be under control of ScoC, AbrB, and PchR and correlated with the amount of pulcherrimin produced by each background. Lastly, our in vitro data indicate a weak direct role for ScoC in controlling pulcherrimin production along with AbrB and PchR. The layered regulation by two distinct regulatory systems underscores the important role for pulcherrimin in B. subtilis physiology. In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, complex arrays of gene networks function together to precisely time the expression of gene products. A prime example is the series of decisions made as cells transition from exponential growth to stationary phase upon nutrient limitation . This phase, termed the transition state, is where cells in the population use environmental cues to inform the next course of action to survive in the new environment, specifically whether to engage in competence, biofilm formation, motility, secondary metabolism, and/or acquisition of nutrients . While there are many transcription factors controlling these processes, an important set among these are called transition state regulators ( TSRs ). Originally defined in the context of sporulation, TSRs are regulators that inhibit expression of genes involved in developmental processes but do not result in a sporulation null mutation when deleted . Notably, mutants in TSRs are still able to carry out post-exponential phenotypes, however the magnitude and timing of these phenotypes are disrupted . ScoC and AbrB represent two well-studied TSRs in B. subtilis. ScoC is a MarR-family winged helix-turn-helix transcription factor first identified in hyper-protease mutants . Microarray analysis between WT and scoC mutants identified 560 genes with differential gene expression involved in motility and genetic competence as well as protease production and peptide transport . The smaller AbrB ( 10. 8 kDa ) is part of a large family of transcription factors with a beta-alpha-beta DNA binding N-terminal domain . Mutants of abrB have pleiotropic effects and some regulatory overlap with ScoC .

[ABSTRACT] After spinal cord injuries ( SCIs ), patients may develop either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the spinal injury. DSD and incontinence reflect the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to helped urination, and urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit bladder emptying. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced DSD and incontinence. We defined, within a mathematical model, the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after a SCI and incorporated into this model the minimum additional neurophysiological features sufficient to replicate the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS of the spine in patients with SCI. We created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations that replicated normal bladder function. We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI, and we increased the density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a more diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of spinal interneurons that remains after SCI. The model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI. When we investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic TMS at two frequencies applied at or below T10, the model replicated the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that has been observed clinically: low-frequency TMS ( 1 Hz ) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI, whereas high-frequency TMS ( 30 Hz ) enhanced urine storage. Neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons, beyond what is necessary to simulate normal bladder function, must be present to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition, and both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms whereby TMS reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI. Many patients with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) above the lumbar spine lose voluntary control of bladder function, either partially or entirely, and develop a neurogenic bladder, which manifests as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) —a lack of coordination between the detrusor and sphincter muscles that prevents effective bladder emptying. On the other hand, patients with SCI at the lumbosacral spinal level have an areflexic, flaccid bladder, reduced bladder capacity, and an inability to store urine leading to incontinence . Electromagnetic stimulation of the spinal cord is a promising approach to restore lower urinary tract ( LUT ) functions after SCI.

[ABSTRACT] Quantifying fungal growth underpins our ability to effectively treat severe fungal infections. Current methods quantify fungal growth rates from time-course morphology-specific data, such as hyphal length data. However, automated large-scale collection of such data lies beyond the scope of most clinical microbiology laboratories. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model of fungal growth to estimate morphology-specific growth rates from easy-to-collect, but indirect, optical density ( OD600 ) data of Aspergillus fumigatus growth ( filamentous fungus ). Our method accounts for OD600 being an indirect measure by explicitly including the relationship between the indirect OD600 measurements and the calibrating true fungal growth in the model. Therefore, the method does not require de novo generation of calibration data. Our model outperformed reference models at fitting to and predicting OD600 growth curves and overcame observed discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD600 versus directly measured data in reference models that did not include calibration. Fungal infections affect over a billion people worldwide and remain a global threat to human health . Combatting fungal infections is essential for treating patients with life-threatening invasive infections . In the clinic, the invasive fungal infection, invasive aspergillosis, is widely prevalent and associated with unacceptably high mortality rates of around 29% , even with treatment. Without appropriate treatment, invasive aspergillosis can result in 100% mortality, as seen with COVID-associated-pulmonary-aspergillosis . Whilst most fungal infections are treated with antifungal drugs , the issue of antifungal resistance , spanning to multi-drug resistance, may shrink an already small pool of treatment options for patients . To avoid patients being left with no treatment options, there is a real need to locate new antifungal drugs and for increased antifungal stewardship . Antifungal stewardship requires detecting and quantifying fungal growth in different conditions to evaluate potential resistance or drug efficacy. Multiple fungal pathogens have recently been identified as critical threats to public health by the world health organisation ( WHO ) . These fungi can exhibit complex growth dynamics, such as filamentation, due to morphogenesis , where morphogenesis is also promoted by exposure to antifungal drugs . The current standards for antifungal susceptibility testing for filamentous fungi, set by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) and the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing ( EUCAST ), involve evaluating minimum inhibitory/fungicidal/effective concentrations ( MIC/MFC/MEC ) in vitro [13–15], which is the minimum drug concentration required to reduce or alter the morphology of fungal biomass within a certain time [15–18]. However, further development of antifungal susceptibility testing for filamentous fungi is required for the following two reasons. First, the current CLSI and EUCAST standards include subjective measurements that depend upon visual inspection of changes in growth . Second, the current guidelines cannot capture time-dependent antifungal activity or antifungal activity specific to a particular fungal morphology ( morphology-specific antifungal activity ). The MIC/MFC/MEC do not describe temporal dynamics of fungal growth because they are based upon a single end-point measurement.

[ABSTRACT] Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes. Most species have XY sex chromosomes, but X0 sex determination mechanisms are also common in some groups. We generated a whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confusum, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and use eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera. We identify ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, that share a conserved set of genes across beetles. While the ancestral X chromosome is maintained across beetles, we find independent additions of autosomes to the ancestral sex chromosomes. These neo-sex chromosomes evolve the stereotypical properties of sex chromosomes, including the evolution of dosage compensation and a non-random distribution of genes with sex-biased expression. Beetles thus provide a new model to gain a better understanding of the diverse forces driving sex chromosome evolution. The order Coleoptera ( beetles ) is the most species-rich group of animals, with well over 400, 000 described taxa. Cytogenetic investigations across thousands of beetle species have revealed a rich diversity of karyotypes. Chromosome numbers vary more than in many other insect groups, suggesting high rates of chromosomal fusions and fissions . Cytogenetic analysis has shown that most species harbor X and Y chromosomes, but X0 sex determination is also common among some groups . In particular, information on sex determination is available for over 4500 beetle species, and 93% of species reported show genetic sex determination ( 17% are X0 and 75% have XY sex chromosomes ). Haplodiploidy and paternal genome elimination is found in only 10 species ( 0. 2% ), and parthenogenesis has been found for 7% of the species investigated . In several clades, fusions between sex chromosomes and autosomes have been reported, creating so called neo-sex chromosomes [4–6]. Beetle sex chromosome karyotypes are typically inferred from testis squashes, and often reported as XY, X0, and Xy+ . XY sex chromosomes typically undergo synapsis during meiosis and can recombine in their pseudoautosomal region in males ( but note that achiasmatic male meiosis has evolved in some groups ). Xy+ sex chromosomes, on the other hand, pair at a distance with no synapsis and no opportunity for recombination during male meiosis . Despite a rich cytogenetic literature , surprisingly little is known about chromosome synteny and karyotype evolution at the molecular level. In particular, it is unclear how well chromosome synteny is conserved in Coleoptera. In Drosophila, and across Diptera, ancestral linkage groups are maintained, and termed ‘Muller elements’ . Gene content of Muller elements is highly conserved and chromosome numbers are relatively stable across flies. Whether similar chromosomal elements exist in beetles, and how broadly they are conserved across the beetle phylogeny, is unclear. Additionally, while chromosomal sex determination is generally conserved across beetles, it is unclear whether the identity of sex chromosomes is conserved.

[ABSTRACT] Chromatin structure and DNA accessibility are partly modulated by the incorporation of histone variants. H2A. Z, encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in S. cerevisiae, is an evolutionarily conserved H2A histone variant that is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR1-complex ( SWR1-C ). While H2A. Z has often been implicated in transcription regulation, htz1Δ mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, given that growth defects of htz1Δ mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SWR1-C subunits, previous work examining the role of H2A. Z in gene expression regulation may be confounded by deleterious activity caused by SWR1-C when missing its H2A. Z substrate ( apo-SWR1-C ). Furthermore, as H2A. Z mutants only display significant growth defects in genotoxic stress conditions, a more substantive role for H2A. Z in gene expression may only be uncovered after exposure to cellular stress. To explore this possibility, we generated mRNA transcript profiles for wild-type, htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea ( HU ), which induces DNA replication stress. Our data showed that H2A. Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure, and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes. We also observed that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation. Furthermore, mapping H2A. Z incorporation before and after treatment with HU revealed that decreases in H2A. Z enrichment at transcription start sites was correlated with, but generally not required for, the upregulation of genes during HU exposure. Together this study characterized the regulatory effects of H2A. Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to HU. Incorporation of histone variants is one of the principal mechanisms that cells use to create structurally and functionally distinct regions of chromatin. H2A. Z is an evolutionarily conserved histone variant in the H2A histone family . Unlike H2A, which is produced in equal amounts to other core histones during S-phase, H2A. Z is encoded by replication-independent genes allowing for variant specific expression and deposition throughout the cell cycle . Essential in higher eukaryotes, H2A. Z has been implicated in a large variety of biological functions including nucleosome turnover, maintenance of heterochromatin and euchromatin boundaries, DNA repair, resistance to genotoxic stress, and transcription regulation . It is therefore not surprising that disruption of proper H2A. Z incorporation has been widely connected to human health and disease including memory formation [4–8], development and progression of various cancers [9–14], and phenotypes of the rare genetic developmental disorder Floating Harbor Syndrome . H2A. Z, encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is incorporated into chromatin by the SWR1 complex ( SWR1-C ), a highly conserved ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeler [16–19]. Replacing H2A in 5–10% of nucleosomes, H2A. Z is primarily incorporated into the +1 nucleosome of the transcription start site ( TSS ) of approximately 63% of all genes in yeast [20–23].

[ABSTRACT] Single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNASeq ) data plays a major role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology. An important current question is how to classify transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNASeq experiments into the various cell types and identify the lineage relationship for individual cells. Because of the fast accumulation of datasets and the high dimensionality of the data, it has become challenging to explore and annotate single-cell transcriptomic profiles by hand. To overcome this challenge, automated classification methods are needed. Classical approaches rely on supervised training datasets. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining data annotated at single-cell resolution, we propose instead to take advantage of partial annotations. The partial label learning framework assumes that we can obtain a set of candidate labels containing the correct one for each data point, a simpler setting than requiring a fully supervised training dataset. We study and extend when needed state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype-based, logistic regression and ensemble methods, to the partial label learning framework. Moreover, we study the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods. We focus particularly on the hierarchical structure of the labels, as commonly observed in developmental processes. We show, on simulated and real datasets, that these extensions enable to learn from partially labeled data, and perform predictions with high accuracy, particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method. We demonstrate that the performances of our methods trained with partially annotated data reach the same performance as fully supervised data. Finally, we study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data, and derive some prescriptive results on the effect of this uncertainty on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods. Overall our findings show how hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies can help solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles, interestingly these methods rely on a much less stringent type of annotated datasets compared to fully supervised learning methods. The field of developmental biology aims to unravel the mechanisms that underlie the transformation of a single-cell into a complex multicellular organism. This process encompasses molecular, cellular, and tissue-level dynamics. To measure this diversity of processes, several complementary acquisition methods are available . In particular scRNASeq methods make it possible to establish a transcriptomic profile for each cell, i. e. a measure of the quantity of RNA associated with each gene . In practice, this transcriptomic profile is, for each cell, a vector of high dimension ( generally of the order of 20, 000: the number of genes considered ), such that each of the coordinates of this vector represents the number of RNA molecules measured associated with a given gene. Because of their high dimensionality, scRNAseq datasets cannot be explored by hand. Therefore several methodological approaches have been proposed to make sense of these datasets.

[ABSTRACT] The RNA content is crucial for the formation of nuclear compartments, such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli. Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) is found in nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipid islets and is involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription. Intriguingly, the nuclear localization of PIP2 was also shown to be RNA-dependent. We therefore investigated whether PIP2 and RNA cooperate in the establishment of nuclear architecture. In this study, we unveiled the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) nuclear proteome in human cells by mass spectrometry. We found that intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins. Moreover, these IDRs of RDPA proteins exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. Our results show for the first time that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) associates with PIP2 in the RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and that altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein. Thus, we propose that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins and affects their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation. This suggests the pivotal role of PIP2 in the establishment of a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression. Differentially phosphorylated inositol headgroups of different phosphoinositides ( PIPs ) serve as a recognition code for the recruitment of a plethora of interacting proteins [1–4]. PIPs are typically embedded in eukaryotic cell membranes where they regulate processes such as vesicular trafficking, actin polymerization, or autophagy . The pioneering work on identifying the presence of PIPs in the cell nucleus was done several decades ago [7–10] but is now receiving increasing attention. One of the most widely studied nuclear PIPs is phosphatidyl inositol 4, 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ). PIP2 localizes to nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and small nucleoplasmic structures called nuclear lipid islets ( NLIs ) . Nuclear PIPs are involved in gene expression . In particular, nuclear PIP2 regulates transcription by affecting the condensation capacity of the RNA Pol2 initiation complex . Interestingly, nuclear compartments containing PIP2, such as the aforementioned nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nucleoplasmic transcription initiation foci, are formed by the process of phase separation [15–21]. The phase separation-driven formation of membraneless compartments, sometimes referred to as ’biomolecular condensates’, is associated with enhanced kinetics of biochemical reactions in the living cell [22–25]. The formation of these compartments provides high local concentrations of reaction components and forms diffusion barriers that serve as adsorption catalyst surfaces . In addition, biomolecular condensates allow the sequential progression of processes through the successive coupling of subsequent reactions in multilayered compartmentalized reaction chambers, such as ribosomal biogenesis in nucleoli, packaging of hnRNP particles in Cajal bodies, or the involvement of nuclear speckles in pre-mRNA splicing [17, 27–29]. The formation of phase-separated biomolecular condensates can be mathematically described and computationally modeled using the theory of stickers and linkers .

[ABSTRACT] Phenotypic plasticity is thought to be an important driver of diversification and adaptation to environmental variation, yet the genomic mechanisms mediating plastic trait development and evolution remain poorly understood. The Scarabaeinae, or true dung beetles, are a species-rich clade of insects recognized for their highly diversified nutrition-responsive development including that of cephalic horns—evolutionarily new, secondary sexual weapons that exhibit remarkable intra- and interspecific variation. Here, we investigate the evolutionary basis for horns as well as other key dung beetle traits via comparative genomic and developmental assays. We begin by presenting chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species in the tribe Onthophagini including Onthophagus taurus, O. sagittarius, and Digitonthophagus gazella. Comparing these assemblies to those of seven other species across the order Coleoptera identifies evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. We then contrast chromatin accessibility in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females and identify distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development, including a large proportion of recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn morph determination. Binding motifs of known and new candidate transcription factors are enriched in these nutrition-responsive open chromatin regions. Our work highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrates gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals, and provides new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this insect group. Phenotypic plasticity is the capacity of a single genotype to produce multiple phenotypes in response to environmental variation and constitutes a ubiquitous property of multicellular life . Plasticity is thought to be an important driver of adaptation, allowing organisms to maintain high fitness in the face of environmental variability, as well as of diversification via evolutionary changes in the genetic architectures underlying plastic trait formation . The ecological and evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity has received much attention, and diverse genes and signal transduction pathways have been identified as important mediators of plastic development across biological systems . In addition to coding sequence, epigenetic modifications such as histone marking are predicted to provide important mechanisms of plastic gene expression regulation ( for reviews, see refs [4–5] ). Further, recent quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis combined with genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 has begun to establish first causal connections between several cis-regulatory elements and the plastic development of nematode feeding structures . Yet despite these advances, the genomic basis underlying developmental plasticity and its evolution, and in particular the role of the non-coding genome and chromatin architecture in regulating conditional responses in trait formation, remain largely unknown. One group of animals that exhibit an extreme degree of phenotypic plasticity are the true dung beetles ( Scarabaeinae ), a hyper-diverse clade found on every continent except Antarctica.

[ABSTRACT] The pathogenesis of Lassa fever has not yet been fully deciphered, particularly as concerns the mechanisms determining whether acute infection is controlled or leads to catastrophic illness and death. Using a cynomolgus monkey model of Lassa virus ( LASV ) infection reproducing the different outcomes of the disease, we performed histological and transcriptomic studies to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. Lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever, with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, subsequent viral tropism varies considerably with disease severity, with viral dissemination limited almost entirely to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever. By contrast, the systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types, leading to infiltrations with macrophages and neutrophils and an excessive inflammatory response, is associated with a fatal outcome. These results provide new insight into early viral dynamics and the host response to LASV infection according to disease outcome. Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus ( LASV ), an Old-World mammarenavirus of the Arenaviridae family . The disease is endemic to West Africa, particularly Nigeria, Benin, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. In these countries, and more particularly in Nigeria and Benin, outbreaks of Lassa fever occur frequently, with lethality rates ranging from 15 to 30% . Sporadic cases are also detected in neighboring countries, such as Ghana, Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, and Burkina Faso [4–6]. LASV is transmitted to humans through contact with its natural reservoir, the peridomestic rodent Mastomys natalensis, or material contaminated with the excreta of these rodents, but alternative reservoirs have also been described . No vaccine has been licensed to date, and the only antiviral drug available, ribavirin, has a very low efficacy or is completely ineffective . Lassa fever is, therefore, a major public health issue in West Africa and has been listed by the WHO as an epidemic threat requiring urgent preparedness. The severity of Lassa fever ranges from asymptomatic infection in a large proportion of patients, to a fatal viral hemorrhagic fever. The disease begins with nonspecific signs, such as fever, asthenia, myalgia, headache, anorexia, abdominal pain, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting and nausea. Facial and/or neck edema, conjunctivitis, hemorrhages, neurological signs, and acute respiratory distress are then observed in patients with severe disease, and death occurs in a context of multiorgan failure . Patients surviving acute disease may experience sequelae, such as pericarditis, deafness and ataxia . LASV is a viral species displaying genetic diversity, with seven lineages described to date, corresponding to different areas of circulation of the virus . Lineages 1, 2, and 3 circulate in Nigeria, lineage 4 is found in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, lineage 5 has been described in Mali and Côte d’Ivoire, and lineage 7 predominates in Togo and Benin [4, 14–16].

[ABSTRACT] Pathological disruption of Nucleocytoplasmic Transport ( NCT ), such as the mis-localization of nuclear pore complex proteins ( Nups ), nuclear transport receptors, Ran-GTPase, and RanGAP1, are seen in both animal models and in familial and sporadic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTD\FTLD ), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias ( AD/ADRD ). However, the question of whether these alterations represent a primary cause, or a downstream consequence of disease is unclear, and what upstream factors may account for these defects are unknown. Here, we report four key findings that shed light on the upstream causal role of Importin-β-specific nuclear transport defects in disease onset. First, taking advantage of two new mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration ( NemfR86S and NemfR487G ) that recapitulate many cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, we find an Importin-β-specific nuclear import block. Second, we observe cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of multiple proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD, including TDP43, Importin-β, RanGap1, and Ran. These findings are further supported by a pathological interaction between Importin-β and the mutant NEMFR86S protein in cytoplasmic accumulations. Third, we identify similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Lastly, we show that even transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in our mouse models and in neurodegeneration. Our convergent results between mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cellular biology provide mechanistic evidence that many of the mis-localized proteins and dysregulated transcriptional events seen in multiple neurodegenerative diseases may in fact arise primarily from a primary upstream defect in Importin- β nuclear import. These findings have critical implications for investigating how sporadic forms of neurodegeneration may arise from presently unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importin-β function. Nucleocytoplasmic transport ( NCT ) defects underlie several neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTD\FTLD ), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias ( AD/ADRD ) [1–3]. Here we show that mutations in Nuclear Export Mediator Factor ( NEMF ) in mice result in Importin-β-specific nuclear import defects, cytoplasmic protein mis-localization, and recapitulate phenotypic and transcriptional alterations found in neurodegenerative disorders. We further show that transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in neurodegenerative diseases. NCT involves the regulated trafficking of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) . Smaller molecules ( <40kDa ) can freely migrate through the nuclear pore, whereas larger molecules require active transport mediated by nuclear transport receptors ( NTRs, also known as karyopherins ) such as importins and exportins .

[ABSTRACT] Lytic bacteriophages hold substantial promise in medical and biotechnological applications. Therefore a comprehensive understanding of phage infection mechanisms is crucial. CRISPR-Cas systems offer a way to explore these mechanisms via site-specific phage mutagenesis. However, phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through extensive DNA modifications like cytosine glycosylation, hindering mutagenesis efficiency. Our study utilizes the eukaryotic enzyme NgTET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications, facilitating Cas nuclease cleavage and enhancing mutagenesis efficiency. This approach enables precise DNA targeting and seamless point mutation integration, exemplified by deactivating specific ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. Furthermore, by temporally removing DNA modifications, we explained the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections without necessitating gene deletions. Our results present a strategy enabling the investigation of phage epigenome functions and streamlining the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications. The described temporal modulation of the phage epigenome is valuable for synthetic biology and fundamental research to comprehend phage infection mechanisms through the generation of mutants. Bacteriophages ( phages ) are viruses that specifically infect prokaryotic hosts. The high potential of the application of lytic phages in both medical and industrial settings has boosted phage research in recent years [1–4]. However, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie efficient phage infections, which is essential for their targeted utilization, remains significantly underexplored. This knowledge gap is evident even in extensively studied phages like the Escherichia coli bacteriophage T4 ( phage T4 ). Approximately half of the 273 encoded proteins in phage T4 are associated with known functions, while the roles of the other proteins remain unclear . To explore the biological functions of phage-derived proteins, gene deletion has been the primary method historically employed, providing critical insights into gene essentiality for the phage infection process . However, mutagenesis targeting only the catalytic residues rather than deleting the entire protein offers a possibility to explained the enzyme’s role within a specific molecular context. The generation of catalytically inactive proteins preserves the other potential functions of the studied protein, such as involvement in protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions. Particularly in phages with complex genomes, like phage T4, which has numerous overlapping genes and gene splicing arrangements , targeted mutagenesis is crucial to avoid unintended effects on other genes’ expression. Prophages, whose genomes are integrated into the host chromosome and passively replicate alongside the host genome, can be mutated in vivo using the same genetic tools as for the mutagenesis of their host. However, this does not apply to lytic phages, as their genetic material exists separately from the host genome within bacterial cells and undergoes rapid replication during a limited time of infection. Therefore, targeted mutagenesis of lytic phages is highly challenging, as evidenced by the diverse strategies developed in recent years to approach it . Many developed approaches rely on recombination between phage DNA and a donor sequence, e. g., homologous recombination. This approach allows for gene replacements, deletions, or insertions.

[ABSTRACT] The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication. A manifold of mechanisms act in concert to ensure adequate DNA repair, gene expression, and genome stability. Bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV light or the DNA-damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline oxide, act as transcriptional and replicational roadblocks and thus represent a major threat to cell metabolism. When located on the transcribed strand of active genes, these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair ( TC-NER ), a yet incompletely understood NER sub-pathway. Here, using a genetic screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified histone variant H2A. Z as an important component to safeguard transcription and DNA integrity following UV irradiation. In the absence of H2A. Z, repair by TC-NER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. Thus, H2A. Z is needed for proficient TC-NER and plays a major role in the maintenance of genome stability upon UV irradiation. Living cells continuously suffer DNA damage that may lead to mutations and genomic instability if left unrepaired. DNA damage may occur by exogenous agents such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet ( UV ) light or chemicals or by endogenous factors derived from the cell metabolism. DNA damage generates structural distortions that interfere with basic cellular functions like transcription and replication. Cells possess a number of pathways to keep DNA lesions, transcription and replication stress under control, many of which are highly conserved throughout evolution. Among the repair pathways, nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) is a versatile repair pathway capable of removing a large variety of structurally unrelated lesions such as UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers ( CPDs ) and pyrimidone 6–4 photoproducts, X-ray induced cyclopurines or adducts induced by chemicals such as 4-nitroquinoline oxide ( 4-NQO ), benzo pyrene, N-acetoxy-2-actylaminofluorene, psoralens, etc. These bulky lesions, which lead to RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) stalling when located on the template strand, can affect gene expression and may have severe consequences for cell function . Furthermore, trapped RNAPs represent an impediment for the replication machinery and can lead to transcription-replication conflicts ( TRCs ), a primary source of genome instability . Hence, bulky DNA lesions exhibit strong mutagenic and thus tumorigenic potential, as exemplified by skin cancer, which is primarily caused by exposure to natural UV light . Transcription-blocking lesions are mainly repaired by transcription-coupled NER ( TC-NER ), which differs from global genome NER ( GG-NER ) in the lesion recognition step, while the core repair reaction is common to both sub-pathways. In TC-NER, stalling of the elongating RNAP at the DNA damage promptly triggers the repair reaction on the transcribed strand ( TS ) of active genes while in GG-NER, a specialized DNA damage recognition complex–which consists of Rad7, Rad16 and Elc1 in budding yeast–improves the detection of the helix-distorting DNA lesions throughout the genome.

[ABSTRACT] The pervasiveness of gene expression variation and its contribution to phenotypic variation and evolution is well known. This gene expression variation is context dependent, with differences in regulatory architecture often associated with intrinsic and environmental factors, and is modulated by regulatory elements that can act in cis ( linked ) or in trans ( unlinked ) relative to the genes they affect. So far, little is known about how this genetic variation affects the evolution of regulatory architecture among closely related tissues during population divergence. To address this question, we analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule as well as microbiome composition in the two gut tissues in four Drosophila melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from two divergent populations: one from the derived, European range and one from the ancestral, African range. In both the transcriptome and microbiome data, we detected extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects, including effects of genetic background on overall tissue specificity. Tissue-specific effects were typically stronger than genetic background-specific effects, although the two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules. An examination of allele specific expression revealed that, while both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes expressed differentially between populations than genes with conserved expression, trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects. Despite there being highly variable regulatory architecture, this observation was strong across tissues and genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence and yielding new insights into cis and trans regulatory evolution. Gene expression variation is extensive at all organismal levels, including among tissues [1–2], cells [3–4], or alleles [5–6] of the same individual, and underlies much of the phenotypic variation that we see among individuals, populations, and species [7–9]. A long-standing challenge in evolutionary genetics has been to identify and characterize this variation. Indeed, elucidating the scope and architecture of gene expression variation as well as the mechanisms that shape it is an integral part of better understanding complex phenotypic traits [10–12], such as body size or disease susceptibility, and their evolution. At the DNA sequence level, genetically heritable variants can modulate expression in two general ways: cis-regulatory variants, such as those within enhancers or promoters, affect the expression of linked, nearby genes, while trans-regulatory variants, such as those affecting transcription factors or regulatory RNAs, affect the expression of unlinked genes that can be located anywhere in the genome ( reviewed in [13–14] ). One way to interrogate the relative contribution of these types of regulatory variants to gene expression variation in species such as Drosophila, where inbred, relatively isogenic strains are available, is to compare gene expression of two parental strains or species as well as expression of their alleles in F1 hybrids .

[ABSTRACT] While the first infection of an emerging disease is often unknown, information on early cases can be used to date it. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, previous studies have estimated dates of emergence ( e. g., first human SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergence of the Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant ) using mainly genomic data. Another dating attempt used a stochastic population dynamics approach and the date of the first reported case. Here, we extend this approach to use a larger set of early reported cases to estimate the delay from first infection to the Nth case. We first validate our framework by running our model on simulated data. We then apply our model using data on Alpha variant infections in the UK, dating the first Alpha infection at ( median ) August 21, 2020 ( 95% interpercentile range across retained simulations ( IPR ): July 23–September 5, 2020 ). Next, we apply our model to data on COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before mid-January 2020. We date the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan at ( median ) November 28, 2019 . Our results fall within ranges previously estimated by studies relying on genomic data. Our population dynamics-based modelling framework is generic and flexible, and thus can be applied to estimate the starting time of outbreaks in contexts other than COVID-19. Dating the first infection of an emerging infectious disease is a step towards tracing the disease’s origin and understanding early epidemic dynamics. Beyond the early transmission of a new pathogen, estimating the date of first infection is also of interest while studying the initiations of local clusters in naïve populations, such as when the pathogen is first introduced to a new location, but also when the pathogen evolves to distinct genotypes such as emerging variants of concern ( VOCs ). Various attempts have been made to date the first human infections by SARS-CoV-2 that led to the COVID-19 pandemic ( noting that earlier spillovers, leading to dead-ends, may have occurred ), using case data and/or viral genomic data. Using a stochastic model for the epidemic spread coupled with genomic data allowing to trace transmission at the individual level, Pekar et al. estimated that the first human infection took place between late October and early December 2019. This estimate was slightly later than a previous one by the same authors, who had previously found an emergence date between mid-October and mid-November 2019 . Their revision notably included updating the dates of the first case reported , and better cleaning up genomic data to exclude sequencing errors . Another, earlier, modeling study used case data only and dated the first COVID-19 case between early October and mid-November 2019, by adapting a technique used in conservation science for dating extinction using observation events .

[ABSTRACT] During meiosis, pairing of homologous chromosomes ( homologs ) ensures the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells, a prerequisite for sexual reproduction. Pairing during meiotic prophase I facilitates crossover recombination and homolog segregation during the ensuing reductional cell division. Mechanisms that ensure stable homolog alignment in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes have remained elusive, but rapid chromosome movements appear to play a role in the process. Apart from homolog attraction, provided by early intermediates of homologous recombination, dissociation of non-homologous associations also appears to contribute to homolog pairing, as suggested by the detection of stable non-homologous chromosome associations in pairing-defective mutants. Here, we have developed an agent-based model for homolog pairing derived from the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble. The model simulates unidirectional chromosome movements, as well as collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces arising from close-range physical interactions. Chromosome number and size as well as movement velocity and repulsive forces are identified as key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing in addition to homolog attraction. Dissociation of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes may contribute to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited nuclear area thus creating preconditions for close-range homolog attraction. Incorporating natural chromosome lengths, the model accurately recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets of other organisms. Double stranded DNA has an uncanny ability to find a homologous partner in DNA mixtures of staggering complexity. While homologs in somatic cells tend to occupy nuclear areas more distant than expected, somatic pairing nevertheless underlies important biological processes, including X chromosome inactivation and association of loci affected by genomic imprinting . During meiosis, homolog pairing is a key prerequisite for the separation of homologs to opposite spindle poles. When pairing is compromised, homologs fail to form crossovers, resulting in homolog nondisjunction and the formation of gametes with a surplus or deficit of one or several chromosomes. The resulting chromosomal imbalances are a leading cause for birth defects and still births . In many organisms, meiotic pairing depends on recombination initiation via double strand breaks ( DSBs ), enzymatically induced by the Spo11 transesterase . DSBs typically occur at a multitude of chromosomal sites, at different positions in different cells. DSB processing is closely associated with the homology search, a process whereby DNA breaks carrying 3’ single-stranded overhangs assess homology between nearby chromosomes at the DNA sequence level . If matched, DSBs are processed via homologous recombination into crossovers as well as other recombination products . Crossovers involve the reciprocal exchange of chromosome arms between homologs at allelic positions. In addition to providing physical linkage between homologs and ensuring their attachment to opposite spindle poles, crossovers also increase genetic diversity . The timing and genetic requirements of homolog pairing have been extensively studied in several organisms [6–10].

[ABSTRACT] Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by inherited TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. MicroRNA miR-34a is a p53 target and modifier gene. Interestingly, miR-34 triple-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development, but the lack of miR-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. miR-34 genes are highly conserved and syntenic between zebrafish and humans. Zebrafish miR-34a and miR-34b/c have similar expression timing in development, but miR-34a is more abundant. DNA damage by camptothecin led to p53-dependent induction of miR-34 genes, while miR-34a mutants were adult-viable and had normal DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, miR-34a-/- compound mutants with a gain-of-function tp53R217H/ R217H or tp53-/- mutants were more cancer-prone than tp53 mutants alone, confirming the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a. Through transcriptomic comparisons at 28 hours post-fertilization ( hpf ), we characterized DNA damage-induced transcription, and at 8, 28 and 72 hpf we determined potential miR-34a-regulated genes. At 72 hpf, loss of miR-34a enhanced erythrocyte levels and up-regulated myb-positive hematopoietic stem cells. Overexpression of miR-34a suppressed its reporter mRNA, but not p53 target induction, and sensitized injected embryos to camptothecin but not to γ-irradiation. The p53 tumor suppressor is essential for cellular homeostasis by responding to DNA damage and other potentially oncogenic stimuli . Under normal conditions, p53 protein levels are tightly controlled; however, stressors ( e. g. DNA damage, oncogene activation ) stabilize and modify p53 to activate it and increase its levels . Upon activation, p53 translocates to the nucleus and activates its target genes , which regulate key genes involved in cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, DNA repair, autophagy, transcriptional regulation, metabolism, and the regulation of p53 . TP53 mutations cause cancer predisposition, are found in most sporadic cancer types at about 30% mean frequency, and germline TP53 mutations are the primary cause of the Li-Fraumeni cancer predisposition syndrome ( LFS ) . microRNA ( miRNA ) genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, processed by Drosha and Dicer enzyme complexes, and then mature 21–25 nucleotide miRNAs associate with the RNA-induced silencing complex to target mRNA by base complementarity. This leads to mRNA translational repression by blocking ribosome recruitment or induces mRNA cleavage . p53 transcriptionally up-regulates many miRNA genes: the miR-34 family of miRNAs and more than 20 other miRNA genes; while a few miRNA genes, such as the miR-17/92 cluster are down-regulated by p53 . Moreover, p53 itself is regulated by more than 20 microRNAs such as miR-125b which negatively controls p53 levels . The miR-34 gene family in most vertebrates consists of miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes. The miR-34a gene is expressed nearly ubiquitously and in most tissues at a much higher level than miR-34b/c, which is expressed predominantly in the mammalian brain, lungs, testes and fallopian tubes . MIR34A was the first microRNA gene identified as a p53 target, which is consistent with evidence that miR-34a overexpression stimulates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [9–12].

[ABSTRACT] Sex determination in the nematode C. elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis. Expression of xol-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes and autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. In males, xol-1 is highly expressed and in hermaphrodites, xol-1 is expressed at very low levels. XOL-1 activity is known to be critical for the proper development of C. elegans males, but its low expression was considered to be of minimal importance in the development of hermaphrodite embryos. Our study reveals that XOL-1 plays an important role as a regulator of developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis. Using a combination of imaging and bioinformatics techniques, we found that hermaphrodite embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division, as well as a more developmentally advanced transcriptional program when xol-1 is lost. Further analyses reveal that XOL-1 is responsible for regulating the timing of initiation of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes, and the appropriate expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites. We found that xol-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape. Some of these effects of the loss of xol-1 gene were reversed by the loss of met-2. These findings demonstrate that XOL-1 plays an important role as a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes, and that MET-2 acts as a downstream effector of XOL-1 activity in hermaphrodites. Embryogenesis is the sequential process of the development of an embryo from fertilization to birth or hatching. Several molecular mechanisms during early embryogenesis have major impacts on the formation and development of the embryo. Two of these are the processes of sex determination and, in some organisms, dosage compensation. Activation of the appropriate sex determination pathways in particular is a critical step in the developmental pathways that regulate sexual reproduction. Within the context of multicellular organisms that have heterogametic sexes, sex determination is an important step that is established very early during embryogenesis. In the case of the nematode C. elegans, activation of the appropriate sex determinations pathway in the two sexes is based on the number of X chromosomes in the developing embryo . Hermaphrodites have two X chromosomes, whereas males only have a single X chromosome. Activation of the appropriate sex determination pathways in both hermaphrodites and males are important for the development of sexually dimorphic anatomy and sexually specialized cells. In C. elegans, hermaphrodites and males differ extensively in their appearance and behavior, and ~30–40% of somatic cells in adults are known to be sexually specialized . Some of these sexually specialized somatic cells, such as sex-specific neuronal cells, arise during early embryogenesis . In addition, hermaphrodite embryos also need to activate dosage compensation . Dosage compensation is the process through which organisms with chromosome-based methods of sex determination equalize gene expression from sex chromosomes between the two sexes. Hermaphrodites have two X chromosomes and the males have only one.

[ABSTRACT] Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing. Especially applicable are mosquito gene drive projects, the potential scale of which leads monitoring to be a significant cost driver. For these projects, monitoring will be required to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites, and the emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes, within intervention sites. This entails the need to distribute mosquito traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible—ideally when remediation is still viable. Additionally, insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insecticide-resistance alleles for which there is also a need to detect as quickly as possible. To this end, we present MGSurvE ( Mosquito Gene SurveillancE ): a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized. A key strength of MGSurvE is that it allows important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for, namely: i ) resources required by mosquitoes ( e. g., food sources and aquatic breeding sites ) can be explicitly distributed through a landscape, ii ) movement of mosquitoes may depend on their sex, the current state of their gonotrophic cycle ( if female ) and resource attractiveness, and iii ) traps may differ in their attractiveness profile. Example MGSurvE analyses are presented to demonstrate optimal trap placement for: i ) an Aedes aegypti population in a suburban landscape in Queensland, Australia, and ii ) an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. Further documentation and use examples are provided in project’s documentation. MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance. Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and yellow fever continue to pose a major public health burden throughout much of the world. Gene drive-modified mosquitoes have been proposed as a potentially transformative tool to complement currently-available tools by biasing inheritance in favor of an introduced allele . Progress has been made in Anopheles malaria vectors towards two general classes of gene drive strategies: i ) “population replacement”, whereby inheritance is biased in favor of an allele that confers refractoriness to pathogen transmission ; and ii ) “population suppression”, whereby vector populations are suppressed by biasing inheritance in favor of an allele that induces a severe fitness cost or sex bias . In Aedes arboviral vectors, a “split drive” system has been engineered with Cas and guide RNA ( gRNA ) drive components at separate loci . Split drive systems display transient drive behavior because the Cas and gRNA components frequently co-occur following a release, but soon dissociate and are eliminated by virtue of fitness costs.

[ABSTRACT] Symbiomonas scintillans Guillou et Chrétiennot-Dinet, 1999 is a tiny ( 1. 4 μm ) heterotrophic microbial eukaryote. The genus was named based on the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum, however, like most such endosymbionts neither the identity nor functional association with its host were known. We generated both amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data from S. scintillans strains RCC257 and RCC24, but were unable to detect any sequences from known lineages of endosymbiotic bacteria. The absence of endobacteria was further verified with FISH analyses. Instead, numerous contigs in assemblies from both RCC24 and RCC257 were closely related to prasinoviruses infecting the green algae Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Bathycoccus prasinos, and Micromonas pusilla ( OlV, BpV, and MpV, respectively ). Using the BpV genome as a reference, we assembled a near-complete 190 kbp draft genome encoding all hallmark prasinovirus genes, as well as two additional incomplete assemblies of closely related but distinct viruses from RCC257, and three similar draft viral genomes from RCC24, which we collectively call SsVs. A multi-gene tree showed the three SsV genome types branched within highly supported clades with each of BpV2, OlVs, and MpVs, respectively. Interestingly, transmission electron microscopy also revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar the morphology and size of the endosymbiont originally reported in S. scintillans. Overall, we conclude that S. scintillans currently does not harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium, but is associated with giant viruses. Understanding the evolutionary history of eukaryotes is inherently linked to understanding their symbiotic relationships with prokaryotes, whether it is in the form of genetically integrated organelles or the multitude of short-term endosymbioses with bacteria or archaea. Most of our understanding about the effects of endosymbiosis on eukaryotic evolution comes from the origin of mitochondria and plastids, and their involvement in eukaryotic diversification [1–4]. However, the impact of prokaryotic symbioses goes far beyond these rare organellogenesis events, given the diverse nature of symbioses affecting hosts in different ways [reviewed in 5, 6]. Through genome sequencing, prokaryotic symbionts were found to be associated with all major eukaryotic supergroups, involved in a myriad of functions such as metabolism [5, 7–9], defense , parasitism , and motility . Additionally, some bacterial lineages have evolved to be “professional symbionts” such as Chlamydiae, Rickettsiales, and Holosporales, consisting entirely of obligate endosymbionts or intracellular parasites of eukaryotic hosts [6, 14–16]. Despite these impacts, most prokaryotic symbionts of eukaryotes are poorly studied, generally only observed with microscopy, and left unidentified and uncharacterized. For example, the only known case of prokaryotic endosymbiosis in non-phototrophic stramenopiles is found in the tiny ( ~1. 4 μm ) bikosia, Symbiomonas scintillans, where two geographically distinct strains were reported to harbour up to 6 endobacteria, and which served as the inspiration for its genus name . The location of these endobacteria within the endoplasmic reticulum was of particular interest, as this is where plastids of phototrophic stramenopiles are located .

[ABSTRACT] The leiomodin ( Lmod ) family of actin-binding proteins play a critical role in muscle function, highlighted by the fact that mutations in all three family members ( LMOD1-3 ) result in human myopathies. Mutations in the cardiac predominant isoform, LMOD2 lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most of the disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense, or frameshift, mutations predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no LMOD protein is expressed. We show here that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a cellular process which eliminates mRNAs with premature termination codons, underlies loss of mutant protein from two independent LMOD2 disease-causing mutations. Furthermore, we generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides that obstruct deposition of the exon junction complex, preventing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of mutant LMOD2 transcripts, thereby restoring mutant protein expression. Our investigation lays the initial groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in LMOD-linked myopathies. The leiomodin ( LMOD ) family of actin-binding proteins are critical for proper function of all types of muscle in humans. A biallelic mutation in LMOD1, the smooth muscle-specific LMOD family member, leads to megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome, a visceral myopathy characterized by defective contractile activity of muscles that line the bladder and intestine . Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in LMOD3, the isoform predominant in skeletal muscle, result in nemaline myopathy, a skeletal muscle disorder characterized by muscle weakness ( there are >20 mutations reported to date ) [2–6]. Additionally, disease causing mutations have been found in the cardiac-predominant isoform, LMOD2. We reported the first known case of a mutation in LMOD2 ( p. W398* ) that results in severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) . then, a second case confirmed the pathogenicity of this mutation . Additional mutations in LMOD2 have been discovered that also result in early-onset DCM and death [9–11]. The mutations are biallelic in all individuals, with three homozygous for the same mutation ( c. 273+1G>A, p. W398*, or p. L415Vfs*108 ) and one consisting of compound heterozygous mutations ( p. R513* and p. L415Vfs*108 ) . All data to date suggest that Lmod-linked muscle diseases have the common underlying pathophysiology of short thin filaments, reduced muscle contractility and severe muscle weakness. Most disease-causing mutations in the LMOD family of genes are nonsense or frameshift mutations which are predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in most cases, little to no LMOD protein is expressed . In the case of the patient with the first described disease-causing mutation in LMOD2 ( p. W398* ), LMOD2 protein was not detected in the explanted heart via western blot analysis and RT-qPCR analysis revealed a decrease in mature LMOD2 mRNA levels, but no change in pre-mRNA levels . Thus, we hypothesized that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) underlies loss of mutant protein expression.

[ABSTRACT] Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer’s disease with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3. To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk, we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing a human ApoE gene ( isoform 2, 3, or 4 ). The regulation of each protein’s homeostasis is observed by measuring turnover rate and abundance for that protein. We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of ~2700 ontologies. In the brain, we found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3. In ApoE4 mice, lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggests that dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy is reducing protein quality. In ApoE2, proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and the membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had a similar increase in degradation which suggests coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology. Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) is one of the lipoproteins used for the transport of lipids and cholesterol throughout the body and the primary transporter in the brain. The three major subtypes of human ApoE—ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4—differ by 2 amino acids and exhibit allelic frequencies of 8. 4%, 77. 9%, and 13. 7%, respectively. The ApoE3 allele is considered the normal or wild-type, and the behavior of the E2 or E4 isoforms differs in measurable ways. The ApoE2 protein isoform, characterized by an R158C substitution relative to the ApoE3, has been associated with decreased affinity for the LDL receptor , while the ApoE4 protein isoform, which features a C112R substitution relative to ApoE3, favors binding to very-low-density lipoprotein receptors . Thus, these seemingly minor genotypic changes may lead to modified receptor mediated signaling, lipid availability and metabolic function, or a combination of factors. Both ApoE2 and E4 modulate disease risk relative to ApoE3. For example, Ferrer et al. observed a ~5-fold increase in Alzheimer’s Disease ( AD ) prevalence in carriers of the ApoE4 allele relative to ApoE3 carriers and a decreased risk ( ~0. 5 fold ) in individuals expressing the ApoE2 allele. Although ApoE2 expression protects against AD, its expression is associated with the increased incidence of familial type III hyperlipoproteinemia—a disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize lipids including cholesterol and triglycerides. ApoE isoforms have also been implicated in the development of Parkinson’s disease , vascular pathology , and most recently, COVID-19 prognosis. Some mechanistic details have been identified for how the ApoE alleles modulate an individual’s risk for disease. ApoE is a transporter of amyloidβ [10–13], a widely recognized biomarker in AD development.

[ABSTRACT] Tissue-specific gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful approach for characterizing gene functions during development. However, this approach has not been successfully applied to most Drosophila tissues, including the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ). To expand tissue-specific CRISPR to this powerful model system, here we present a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRISPR-TRiM ) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells. We validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue, demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system, and showed simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes. We used CRISPR-TRiM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Lastly, we found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ. Thus, we have successfully developed an NMJ CRISPR mutagenesis approach which we used to reveal genes important for NMJ structural plasticity. Characterization of developmental mechanisms often involves loss-of-function ( LOF ) analysis of genes in organisms. Besides the more traditional methods of LOF, such as whole-organismal mutations and RNA interference ( RNAi ), tissue-specific mutagenesis through the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently emerged as another powerful approach [1–5]. In this approach, either Cas9 or gRNAs ( or both ) are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, so that CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of the gene of interest ( GOI ) occurs only in the desired tissues . Although tissue-specific CRISPR can be very effective for studying gene function, its successful application has been limited to a small number of Drosophila tissues, including the germline , sensory neurons [9–12], prothoracic gland , mushroom body neurons , imaginal tissues , epidermal cells , circadian neurons and cardiomyocytes . The Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) is a powerful model for studying many biological processes, such as axon development, synaptogenesis, synaptic function and plasticity, and locomotion [18–20]. Although CRISPR has been used to tag endogenous proteins at the NMJ , tissue-specific CRISPR has not yet been successfully applied to the fly NMJ. NMJs are special synaptic connections formed between motor neurons and somatic muscles . The axon termini of the motor neurons release extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) into the space between axons and muscles [23–26]. Outside the nervous system, EVs can originate from many types of cells and can carry diverse cargos made of all four types of biomolecules ( carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids ) . These vesicles may function in long-distance signal transduction and cell-cell communication and have been shown to play important roles in many physiological and pathological processes . EVs at Drosophila NMJs contain several protein and nucleic acid cargos and regulate synaptic structure and activity by mediating axon-to-muscle signal transduction .

[ABSTRACT] Post-larval hematopoiesis in Drosophila largely depends upon the stockpile of progenitors present in the blood-forming organ/lymph gland of the larvae. During larval stages, the lymph gland progenitors gradually accumulate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), which is essential to prime them for differentiation. Studies have shown that ROS triggers the activation of JNK ( c-Jun Kinase ), which upregulates fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) to helped progenitor differentiation. Intriguingly, despite having ROS, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in the late larval stages. Using expression analyses, genetic manipulation and pharmacological approaches, we found that the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish ( Rel ) shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that inducts them into the differentiation program by curtailing the activation of JNK. Although ROS serves as the metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, the input from ROS is monitored by the developmental signal TAK1, which is regulated by Relish. This developmental circuit ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely. Our study sheds light on how, during development, integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways seem crucial to regulating cell fate transition during development. The site for definitive hematopoiesis in Drosophila is the lymph gland, a multi-lobed, larval blood-forming organ [1–5]. During larval development, the prohemocytes within this organ proliferate and differentiate. With the onset of pupation, the entire cohort of hemocytes is released into circulation to take care of post-larval requirements . The mature lymph gland has a well-characterized anterior lobe/primary lobe with three distinct zones and a niche ( Posterior Signaling Center ) crucial for maintaining the bulk of the progenitors . The medially located heterogeneous progenitor cells [9–11] constitute the medullary zone ( MZ ) at the core and distally located rim of intermediate progenitors ( IZ ), while the differentiated hemocytes in the periphery of the organ define the cortical zone ( CZ ) of the primary lobe ( Fig 1A ) . Although the lymph gland progenitors proliferate to increase their number right from the early instar, strong differentiation is noticed only in the third instar stage . It is intriguing how this reserve population within the lymph gland is intercepted from precociously inducting into the differentiation program. Studies have shown that developmentally regulated, moderately high Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS ) levels in the blood progenitor cells of the Drosophila mature lymph gland elicit c-Jun Kinase ( JNK ) to helped their differentiation . Recent studies have also shown that the JNK-FAO axis is essential for progenitor differentiation . We wondered that if ROS triggers differentiation, then why doesn’t the pool of progenitors differentiate entirely ? Why does the differentiation of the progenitors initiate at the rim of MZ despite the entire MZ being enriched in ROS ? What shields the progenitors from entering the differentiation program even though they are enriched in ROS ?

[ABSTRACT] Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly with abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNU4ATAC gene. Its transcript, the small nuclear RNA U4atac, is involved in the excision of ~850 minor introns. Here, we report a patient presenting with TALS features but no pathogenic variants were found in RNU4ATAC, instead the homozygous RTTN c. 2953A>G variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. After deciphering the impact of the variant on the RTTN protein function at centrosome in engineered RTTN-depleted RPE1 cells and patient fibroblasts, we analysed neural stem cells ( NSC ) derived from CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells and revealed major cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, leading to aneuploidy, cell cycle arrest and cell death. In cortical organoids, we discovered an additional function of RTTN in the self-organisation of NSC into neural rosettes, by observing delayed apico-basal polarization of NSC. Altogether, these defects contributed to a marked delay of rosette formation in RTTN-mutated organoids, thus impeding their overall growth and shedding light on mechanisms leading to microcephaly. The Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ), or MOPD1 , is a very rare genetic disease with less than 100 reported cases [1–6] characterized by severe pre- and post-natal growth delay, severe microcephaly with brain abnormalities ( abnormal gyral pattern, intracranial cyst, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and corpus callosum agenesis ), intellectual deficiency, bone abnormalities, bulging eyes and dry skin with eczema, as well as a premature death during the first months of life for the most severe cases [7–9]. Since the identification of RNU4ATAC in 2011 , no other gene has been associated with this disease. RNU4ATAC is a non-coding gene transcribed into the small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) U4atac, a component of the minor spliceosome. This ribonucleic complex excises less than one percent of all human introns , and deficiency in its function leads in most cases to minor intron retention that impairs the correct maturation of about 750 minor-intron containing transcripts [2, 13–17]. Here, we report on a patient with clinical features of TALS but no variants in RNU4ATAC. Whole exome sequencing rather revealed she has the homozygous pathogenic missense variant NM_173630: RTTN c. 2953A>G, p. Arg985Gly, which also alters splicing. This gene has already been implicated in human disease, notably “microcephaly, short stature and polymicrogyria with or without seizure” . Up to now, 39 patients from 23 families have been reported with bi-allelic pathogenic variants in RTTN [18–33] of which 4 patients, from 3 families, have the c. 2953A>G variant. Most of these patients exhibit common features, at variable degrees of severity, including microcephaly with gyral pattern abnormalities, sloping forehead, intellectual deficiency, and pre- and post-natal growth delay. A few patients only were deceased at the time of publication, with one third of them having reached teenage- or adulthood.

[ABSTRACT] Like many other non-sporulating bacterial species, Escherichia coli is able to survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion, by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase ( LTSP ). In July 2015, we initiated a set of evolutionary experiments aimed at characterizing the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LTSP. In these experiments populations of E. coli were allowed to initially grow on fresh rich media, but were not provided with any new external growth resources since their establishment. Utilizing whole genome sequencing data obtained for hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points spanning the first six years of these experiments, we reveal several new aspects of the dynamics of adaptation. First, we show that E. coli continuously adapts genetically, up to six years under resource exhaustion, through the highly convergent accumulation of mutations. We further show that upon entry into LTSP, long-lasting lineages are established. This lineage structure is in itself convergent, with similar lineages arising across independently evolving populations. The high parallelism with which adaptations occur under LTSP, combined with the LTSP populations’ lineage structure, enable us to screen for pairs of loci displaying a significant association in the occurrence of mutations, suggestive of a historical contingency. We find that such associations are highly frequent and that a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one such association. Combined our results demonstrate that LTSP adaptation is characterized by remarkably high parallelism and frequent historical contingency. Evolution is a historical process, in which the potential of certain adaptive events to occur, may sometimes depend on the previous occurrence of other events. Historical contingency is generally defined as the dependence of adaptation on the history of a population . Such history can manifest through the chronology of experienced conditions, the order of previously acquired mutations, or both [2–4]. The role of historical contingency in determining adaptive trajectories has long been debated. Researchers have argued about whether evolution is largely deterministic, most frequently following the same paths, or whether evolution tends to be far less predictable, due in part to frequent contingencies, making it impossible to “replay life’s tape” . Making these arguments more confusing, the word ‘contingency’ itself is often used to imply different meanings: on the one hand a possible, but quite unlikely and thus unpredictable, future event ( e. g. planning for every contingency ), and on the other hand an event whose occurrence depends on a different event and is quite likely given that event. In this paper, the term ‘contingency’ will be used to describe mutations whose adaptive nature is significantly dependent on the previous acquisition of other adaptive mutations. One well-characterized example of historical contingency was revealed as part of Richard Lenski’s seminal long-term evolutionary experiment ( LTEE ) . The LTEE was initiated in 1988, when 12 independent populations of E. coli were established in glucose-limited growth media, supplemented with citrate.

[ABSTRACT] Although originally classified as a non-coding RNA, the male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) RNA from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex has recently been shown to code for a micropeptide that plays a vital role in determining how mated females use stored sperm after mating. Interestingly, the MSA transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript produced in both sexes within the posterior central nervous system from an alternative promoter, called the iab-8 lncRNA. However, while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide, it seems that the iab-8 transcript does not. Here, we show that the absence of iab-8 translation is due to a repressive process requiring the two unique 5’ exons of the iab-8 lncRNA. Through cell culture and transgenic analysis, we show that this process relies on the presence of upstream open reading frames present in these two exons that prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames. Within the cis-regulatory region controlling the expression of the two, most-posterior homeotic genes of Drosophila melanogaster ( abd-A and Abd-B ), two transcripts have been identified that differ only at their 5’ ends [1–3]. Both transcripts are spliced and polyadenylated but are expressed in different tissues. Originally both of these transcripts were categorized as non-coding. The longer of these two transcripts is called the iab-8 lncRNA and is expressed in the posterior central nervous system ( CNS ) . Loss of the iab-8 ncRNA leads to male and female sterility, largely due to the loss of a miRNA located within its intronic sequences . A slightly shorter, second version of this transcript also exists, called male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) . As its name suggests, MSA is a male-specific transcript that was found in libraries made from Drosophila male abdomen. Later, it was found that this transcript is specifically expressed in a particular cell type of the seminal fluid producing, male accessory gland ( AG ), called the secondary cells ( SCs ) . MSA shares all but its first exon with the iab8 lncRNA ( See Fig 1 ). As such, it also acts as a template to create the same miRNA as the iab-8 lncRNA ( miR-iab-8 ). We have previously shown that the loss of this miRNA in the AG leads to both the abnormal development of the secondary cells and an abnormal post-mating response in females after mating . Although both of these RNAs were originally classified as non-coding and have essential non-coding functionalities, we recently discovered that the MSA version of the transcript is actually protein coding . Using ribosome immunoprecipitation and GFP knock-ins, we showed that the MSA transcript serves as a template for a small peptide that we call MSAmiP. Through deletion and frameshift mutations, we found that MSAmiP plays a role in regulating sperm usage in fertilized females.

[ABSTRACT] Mutations in glycosylation pathways, such as N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and GPI anchor synthesis, lead to Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ( CDG ). CDG typically present with seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delay but display large clinical variability with symptoms affecting every system in the body. This variability suggests modifier genes might influence the phenotypes. Because of the similar physiology and clinical symptoms, there are likely common genetic modifiers between CDG. Here, we use evolution as a tool to identify common modifiers between CDG and glycosylation genes. Protein glycosylation is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Evolutionary rate covariation ( ERC ) identifies proteins with similar evolutionary rates that indicate shared biological functions and pathways. Using ERC, we identified strong evolutionary rate signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with ncRNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins. We also identified strong patterns of ERC based on cellular sub-localization of the GPI anchor synthesis enzymes. Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified new genetic modifiers of CDG genes. ERC analysis of disease genes and biological pathways allows for rapid prioritization of potential genetic modifiers, which can provide a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and new therapeutic targets. Phenotypic variation is common in Mendelian diseases, even in patients with the same disease-causing variant [1–3]. Understanding the factors underlying variable disease presentation can be difficult despite often knowing the causal disease gene. Genetic modifiers can enhance or suppress the phenotype of a primary disease-causing mutation, but they may not independently lead to disease phenotypes. Congenital disorders of glycosylation ( CDG ) are a group of ultra-rare multisystemic disorders typically characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delays . However, because of the ubiquity of glycosylation, symptoms of CDG can affect most organ systems. Loss-of-function mutations in 189 glycosylation genes lead to CDG . Patients with the same CDG and even the same disease-causing variant can show phenotypic variability, indicating that genetic background and environment can influence clinical presentation . Current treatment options for CDG are limited, primarily focusing on symptom management . Identifying genetic modifiers of glycosylation genes could lead to new therapeutic targets for CDG patients. Protein glycosylation is essential for proper protein folding, stability, and localization . There are three main types of glycosylation: N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor biosynthesis. N-linked glycosylation is the addition of a glycan onto an asparagine . The glycan is synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane, with the stepwise addition of sugars onto a dolichol-phosphate. The glycan is then transferred from the dolichol-phosphate onto a protein and undergoes further glycan additions and trimming in the ER and Golgi. O-linked glycosylation is the addition of a glycan to the hydroxyl group of a serine, threonine, or hydroxylysine .

[ABSTRACT] The HBV core ( HBc ) protein contains an N-terminal domain ( NTD ) for capsid assembly and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain ( CTD ) for pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBc CTD, especially at Ser162 and Ser170, is essential for nucleation with the polymerase ( Pol ) to initiate pgRNA encapsidation. As capsids mature, the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation, which remains to be determined. Using a C-S170 antibody specific for non-phosphorylated HBc-Ser170, we observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state during pgRNA packaging. The Pol-dependent dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 was confirmed by the substitution of one single amino acid at Val782 in the RNase H domain, which abolished the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry analyses, and the protein structural analyses showed that the recruitment of the host phosphatase PP1 is dependent on the Pol-Val782 domain. This recruitment does not require HBc but does require Pol via epsilon RNA signal, suggesting that the Pol-pgRNA complex plays a key role in PP1 recruitment. Pol-pgRNA-PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and appears to be associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ). Therefore, HBV Pol may play a dual role by initially bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HBc and recruiting PP1 for later completion of RNA packaging into the capsids. These findings not only decipher the process by which Pol-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc regulates pgRNA encapsulation, but also reveal the possibility of PP1 as a potential target for antiviral development. Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is a hepatotropic virus with a 3. 2 kb circular partially double-stranded DNA genome enclosed within an icosahedral nucleocapsid and outer envelope . Following the infection of hepatocytes through the NTCP receptor and uncoating, the viral relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) is imported and converted to closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) in the nucleus . This cccDNA serves as the template for the production of pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) and four viral mRNA transcripts, which are then translated into viral proteins . Later, the HBV core ( HBc ) protein and polymerase ( Pol ) encapsidates the pgRNA to form the viral nucleocapsid, where reverse transcription and DNA synthesis occur . Mature nucleocapsids containing rcDNA assemble with envelope proteins into complete virions that bud from multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) . The process of pgRNA encapsidation has emerged as a promising target for new antiviral therapies such as HBc protein allosteric modulators ( CpAMs ) . Therefore, there has been substantial interest in understanding the mechanisms utilized by the HBc and Pol to execute pgRNA encapsidation. The HBc protein, which is composed of ~183 a. a., is separated into an N-terminal domain ( NTD, residues 1–140 ) and a C-terminal domain ( CTD, residues 150–183 ) by a 10 a. a. linker sequence .

[ABSTRACT] Bacterial symbionts, with their shorter generation times and capacity for horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ), play a critical role in allowing marine organisms to cope with environmental change. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct environmental conditions in the Tropical Eastern Pacific ( TEP ) and Caribbean, offering a “natural experiment” for studying how closely related animals evolve and adapt under environmental change. However, the role of bacterial symbionts in this process is often overlooked. We sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena ( family Lucinidae ) collected on either side of the Isthmus, to investigate how differing environmental conditions have influenced the selection of symbionts and their metabolic capabilities. The lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts and only those from the Caribbean had the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the TEP did not. Interestingly, this nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon by including other lucinid symbiont genomes from around the world further revealed that the last common ancestor ( LCA ) of Ca. Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through HGT from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage. Our study suggests that HGT of the nif operon has helped niche diversification of the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida species clade. It highlights the importance of nitrogen availability in driving the ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbiont species and the role that bacterial symbionts may play in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions. Global change gives rise to new environmental conditions and niches that organisms can adapt to and exploit, and the extent and mechanisms of adaptation in marine species may be significantly influenced by their microbiomes . Bacterial symbionts of animals can potentially adapt to changing environments more rapidly and more flexibly than their hosts due to traits such as shorter generation times, enhanced recombination capabilities, and the potential for horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) between distantly-related organisms . In addition, horizontally acquired bacterial symbionts—those obtained from the environment in each generation—have access to a larger genetic pool for genetic exchange during their free-living phase, which can lead to faster adaptive responses . Consequently, symbionts can serve as a source of ecological innovation, enabling the symbiosis to tap into new resources and adapt to new habitats [4–6]. Understanding the mechanisms enabling microbial symbionts to adapt to new environmental conditions will provide new insights into how animal-microbe symbioses respond to changing environments. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama about 2. 8 million years ago had a profound impact on oceanic conditions, altering environmental factors such as ocean currents, salinity, temperature, and nutrient availability on both sides of the Isthmus .

[ABSTRACT] TAS2Rs are a family of G protein-coupled receptors that function as bitter taste receptors in vertebrates. Mammalian TAS2Rs have historically garnered the most attention, leading to our understanding of their roles in taste perception relevant to human physiology and behaviors. However, the evolution and functional implications of TAS2Rs in other vertebrate lineages remain less explored. Here, we identify 9, 291 TAS2Rs from 661 vertebrate genomes. Large-scale phylogenomic analyses reveal that frogs and salamanders contain unusually high TAS2R gene content, in stark contrast to other vertebrate lineages. In most species, TAS2R genes are found in clusters; compared to other vertebrates, amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster. We find that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, although total TAS2R count is stable in most lineages. Interestingly, TAS2R count is proportional to the receptors expressed solely in extra-oral tissues. In vitro receptor activity assays uncover that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics. The ability of vertebrates to detect the five cardinal tastes—sweet, umami, salty, sour, and bitter—plays a pivotal role in regulating myriad aspects of animal physiology and behavior. Whereas sweet, umami, and mildly salty are generally considered to be attractive stimuli, guiding animals towards nutrient-rich foods, bitter and sour are considered aversive, and are believed to guide animals away from noxious substances, such as toxins or metabolites found in spoiled food . Each taste is generally associated with a suite of related receptors . Bitterness, as perceived by humans, is detected by a family of G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) called TAS2Rs or T2Rs, encoded by compact, intronless genes. Previous studies have shown that vertebrates have a wide repertoire of TAS2Rs, which varies considerably across lineages, from zero in cetaceans to over two hundred in frogs [3–5]. Detailed evolutionary, expression, and functional studies have been performed in a variety of species, with a bias towards rodents and primates. TAS2R genes appear to be under relatively rapid birth and death evolution in many vertebrate lineages, with significant differences even between close relatives like rats and mice or humans and other primates . In humans and mice, the majority of TAS2Rs are in two or three gene clusters ( 0. 7–30 MB each, containing 10–29 receptors ) in the genome with one or two additional singleton genes per genome . There is considerable variation in the presence or absence of distinct TAS2R family members within species, with evidence of rapid pseudogenization and whole gene deletion in chimpanzees . Over the last two decades, ligands have been identified for a wide range of receptors, including humans and mice [10–12], primates [13–17], domestic cats , domestic dogs , bats [20–23], marsupials and monotremes , birds , fish , and frogs . These studies have shown that some receptors are highly specific, with only one or two known ligands, whereas others respond to a broader suite of chemicals and are considered promiscuous.

[ABSTRACT] A tri-protein complex containing NICD, RBPj and MAML1 binds DNA as monomer or as cooperative dimers to regulate transcription. Mice expressing Notch dimerization-deficient alleles ( NDD ) of Notch1 and Notch2 are sensitized to environmental insults but otherwise develop and age normally. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids uncovered no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene miss-regulation, confirmed impaired stem cell maintenance in-vitro, and discovered an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts, a likely underlying cause for heightened sensitivity in NDD mice. TurboID followed by quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line expressing either NOTCH2DD or NOTCH2 revealed an unbalanced interactome, with reduced interaction of NOTCH2DD with the transcription machinery but relatively preserved interaction with the HDAC2 interactome suggesting modulation via cooperativity. To ask if HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes, we used the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could prevent the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitors ( DBZ or DAPT ) treatment in mice and spheroids, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells. The canonical Notch signaling pathway allows adjacent cells to communicate via ligands and receptors embedded in the plasma membrane. Mammals express four Notch receptors ( Notch1 ( N1 ), N2, N3 and N4 ) and 5 ligands ( Delta-like1 ( Dll1 ), Dll3, Dll4, Jagged1 ( Jag1 ) and Jag2 ). Ligand binding to a receptor unfolds a negative regulatory domain to activate a series of consecutive proteolytic cleavages releasing the Notch intracellular domain ( NICD ). The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms the Notch transcription complex ( NTC ) together with the co-factors RBPj/CSL ( Recombinant binding protein for immunoglobulin J Kappa; CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG-1 ) and MAML ( Mastermind-like ) family members. In the absence of NICD, CSL associates with co-repressors SPEN ( Split Ends homologue, also called MINT ( MSX2 interacting nuclear target ) or SHARP ( SMRT/HDAC1 associated Repressor Protein ) ), NCOR1 ( nuclear receptor corepressor1 ), NCOR2 ( also called SMART ) and others, maintaining transcription in the off-state . In the nucleus, the NTCs bind to DNA to regulate target gene expression [3–7]. Binding to the DNA occurs on conserved CSL sites. NICDs can form NTC homo- or hetero-dimers on sequence-paired-sites ( SPS ) which consists of two CSL sites organized in head-to-head orientation 15–18 nucleotides apart [8–13]. To investigate the biological function of NTC dimers we generated mice with ARG to ALA substitutions at the dimer interface in both Notch1 and Notch2 to block dimerization . These mice showed defects in multiple organs, including spleen, heart and the intestine . They proved to be hypersensitive to environmental conditions, with hypo-allergenic environment ameliorating many of the more severe phenotypes ( further analyzed in separate study— ).

[ABSTRACT] Background selection, by which selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites, influences patterns of total neutral diversity, πT, and genetic differentiation, FST, in structured populations. The theory of background selection may be split into two regimes: the background selection regime, where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are sufficiently low such that deleterious alleles are at a deterministic mutation-selection balance, and the interference selection regime, where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are sufficiently high that deleterious alleles accumulate and interfere with another, leading to selective interference. Previous work has quantified the effects of background selection on πT and FST only for deleterious alleles in the background selection regime. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that migration reduces the effects of background selection on FST, but this has not been fully explained. Here, we derive new theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extend previous theory from the interference selection regime to make predictions in an island model. Using simulations, we show that this theory best predicts FST and πT. Moreover, we demonstrate that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates, because migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations. However, we show that background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT, particularly for metapopulations with a larger effective population size. Our work further extends the theory of background selection into structured populations, and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans. Zeng and Corcoran suggested that the effects of FST in an island model would be predictable from modifying the effective size of a subpopulation, Nlocal, by multiplying times B, the Ne/N ratio created by background selection. We show here that migration lessens the effects of background selection on the amount of genetic differentiation caused by local drift relative to predictions of B based on earlier work ( e. g. Ref ). Then, we derive the expected FST in an island model with background selection and a finite number of demes, when migration follows genetic drift. In this section, we extend the quantitative genetic approach to modeling background selection, following the framework of Santiago and Caballero [24–26] and Buffalo and Kern , to account for how migration influences the effects of background selection, B, in an island model consisting of diploid individuals. In brief, these models consider how the additive genetic fitness variance experienced by a neutral allele due to its associations with deleterious alleles further increase its variance in reproductive success, therefore reducing its effective population size beyond that of a mutation-drift model. Given that this additional increase in the variance of reproductive success of neutral alleles is due to selection at linked sites, this has been termed the fitness-effective population size, Nf .

[ABSTRACT] Increasing genetic and phenotypic data size is critical for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases. Evidently, establishing practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies. As the sample sizes become more heterogeneous, complex statistical approaches, such as generalized linear mixed effects models, must be used to correct for the confounders that may bias results. On another front, due to the privacy concerns around Protected Health Information ( PHI ), genetic information is restrictively protected by sharing according to regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ). This limits data sharing among institutions and hampers efforts around executing high-powered collaborative studies. Federated approaches are promising to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance, since sensitive data never leaves the local sites. Motivated by these, we developed FedGMMAT, a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites. Genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites, and the intermediate statistics are protected by encryption. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate FedGMMAT can achieve the virtually same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. With the surge of genomic data generated by Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) [1–4], number of available genomes have surpassed millions. These data provides opportunities to map genetic factors underlying complex diseases and phenotype. Arguably, Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) are the most popular methods for uncovering the genetic determinants of phenotypic variation [5–7]. State of the art GWAS tools rely employ mixed modeling to assess the statistical significance between variant genotypes and phenotypes while accounting for the biases in ancestry and cryptic relatedness [8–11]. Among these methods, linear mixed models ( LMMs ) have been popularly used for analyzing continuous traits, their intrinsic assumptions ( uniform distribution of residuals with respect to variant allele frequency ) may bias analyses of the binary traits. For these cases, generalized linear mixed models have been shown to provide unbiased results . Although statistical modeling has advanced in recent years, the real utility of data can be only realized when large sample sizes and more diverse populations are available to identify salient genetic variants. However, it is challenging to build centralized repositories of large datasets mainly due to privacy concerns and data usage agreements . Numerous studies demonstrated that genetic data is very identifying of its owner and their families [14–20]. Due to very high dimensional nature of genomic data ( i. e., very large number of variants ), sharing even summary statistics, and other related intermediate data, or simply the existence of variants ( e. g., beacons [21–23] ) can create risks of membership inference , i. e., whether an individual with known genotypes participated a study.

[ABSTRACT] Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-biased incidence and mortality. Polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ) offer promising advancements in predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer. While their accuracy continues to improve, research aimed at enhancing their effectiveness within African and Asian populations remains key for equitable use. Recent algorithmic developments for PRS derivation have resulted in improved pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases. In this study, we benchmark the predictive power of six widely used PRS derivation algorithms, including four of which adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts. We find modest improvement in discriminatory ability when compared with a simple method that prioritizes variants, clumping, and published polygenic risk scores. Our findings underscore the importance of improving upon risk prediction algorithms and the sampling of diverse cohorts. Prostate cancer ( PCa ) is the most commonly diagnosed tumor type in American men, accounting for 26% of all cancer cases . Several genetic and environmental factors such as age, body mass index ( BMI ), family history and ancestry are strong risk factors for developing PCa . Men of African ancestry have 1. 5-fold higher incidence and those of Asian ancestry have a decreased incidence rate when compared to non-Hispanic white men . However, the genetic basis for ancestry-linked disparities remains unclear. PCa is a heritable cancer where 58% of disease risk has been linked to genetic factors . It is hypothesized that genetic predisposition may contribute to ancestry-linked risk. Although genome-wide associations studies ( GWASs ) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) associated with PCa risk, they have primarily been conducted in European-ancestry cohorts [6–8]. Polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ), which combine risk associated with multiple variants into a single risk score, are usually created using SNPs derived from these GWASs. Consequently, PRSs may share the population-bias of the European ancestry-based GWAS and cannot be confidently applied to non-European populations. These biases are associated with differences in linkage disequilibrium, causal variant status and differing causal variant allele frequencies across populations . Admixture mapping and meta analyses have revealed rare and common risk alleles specific to men of African ancestry [10–12]. The challenge of integrating genetic findings with the well-powered European-based GWAS results has led to the development of several methods that correct the biases within the European ancestry results [13–17]. The variability in complexity and correction efficiency across these methods presents an opportunity to systematically analyze their performance in PCa. PRS-stratified prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening may help reduce overdiagnosis and subsequent over-treatment associated with PSA screening alone . However, given ancestry-associated PCa incidence and outcome biases, it is imperative that risk scores work equally well across populations to limit disparities. In this study, we first evaluated the performance of several published polygenic risk scores in the UK biobank cohort.

[ABSTRACT] DPAGT1-CDG is a Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation ( CDG ) that lacks effective therapies. It is caused by mutations in the gene DPAGT1 which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation. We used a Drosophila rough eye model of DPAGT1-CDG with an improperly developed, small eye phenotype. We performed a drug repurposing screen on this model using 1, 520 small molecules that are 98% FDA/EMA-approved to find drugs that improved its eye. We identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DPAGT1-CDG model. Notably from this screen, we found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DPAGT1-CDG model. Loss of both dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model, suggesting that dopaminergic flux and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DPAGT1 deficiency. This links dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation and represents a new potential therapeutic target for treating DPAGT1-CDG. We also genetically validate other top drug categories including acetylcholine-related drugs, COX inhibitors, and an inhibitor of NKCC1. These drugs and subsequent analyses reveal new biology in DPAGT1 mechanisms, and they may represent new therapeutic options for DPAGT1-CDG. Nearly 10% of the US population has a rare disease, yet over 95% lack effective therapeutics . One solution to find new therapeutics is drug repurposing which use drugs that are already approved or under investigation . When successful, drug repurposing screens provide immediate potential therapeutics that have already passed the rigor of human safety trials and may have a faster route of clinical approval . Alternatively, they can potentially be used in an off-label capacity at a clinician’s discretion [3–5]. Even if a repurposed screen does not immediately result in a new therapy, it can still identify new biological interactions that can increase our understanding of a disorder. DPAGT1-CDG is a rare disease that results from autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme DPAGT1. It is one of nearly 200 Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ( CDGs ) [6–9]. Glycosylation includes multiple pathways where sugars are co- or post-translationally added to proteins, lipids, or RNAs . For proteins, it is critical for their proper localization, folding, and function . DPAGT1 is part of the N-glycosylation pathway where these sugars are added to specific asparagine ( N ) residues, typically part of the canonical consensus sequence N-X-S/T where X is a non-proline amino acid . DPAGT1 synthesizes dolichol-PP-GlcNAc which is the first step in N-glycosylation . DPAGT1-CDG causes developmental delay, muscle weakness, and seizures, among other symptoms . Less severe mutations in DPAGT1 can cause a form of congenital myasthenia syndrome ( CMS ) called DPAGT1-CMS . Unlike DPAGT1-CDG, the CMS form has a known disease process caused by hypoglycosylation of acetylcholine and calcium receptors . Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that increase acetylcholine levels can alleviate muscle weakness symptoms in both DPAGT1-CDG and -CMS patients [17–19]. For treating seizures, antiepileptic drugs have also been prescribed for DPAGT1-CDG and other CDGs .

[ABSTRACT] Proprioception is one of the least understood senses, yet fundamental for the control of movement. Even basic questions of how limb pose is represented in the somatosensory cortex are unclear. We developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity ( topo-VAE ) to compute a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data. Although not fitted to neural data, our model reproduces two sets of observations from monkey centre-out reaching: 1. The shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates despite the model having no knowledge of arm kinematics or hand coordinate systems. 2. The distribution of neuronal preferred directions ( PDs ) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model makes several testable predictions: 1. Encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of PDs. 2. Few neurons will encode just a single joint. Our model provides a principled basis for understanding of sensorimotor representations, and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots. Somatosensation includes the familiar sense of touch, provided by receptors in the skin, and proprioception, the much less consciously perceived sense that informs us about the pose, motion and associated forces acting on our limbs. Both are essential for our ability to plan, control and adapt movements. In engineering, the control of robotic movement would be impossible if the controller did not know the location of its actuators; correspondingly in human motor control, popular frameworks for explaining many types of movement, such as optimal feedback control theory , are dependent on feedback such as that provided by proprioception. Moreover, individuals with proprioceptive neurological deficits, such as patient IW, have profound motor deficits even in the presence of vision and an intact motor system . Similarly, recent major developments in the control of limb movement through intracortical Brain Computer Interfaces are centred on restoring somatosensory sensory feedback as well as effecting motion [5–8]. Thus far, these efforts have been almost exclusively limited to the sense of touch, in part because of our better understanding of that modality. However, restored proprioceptive feedback is also likely to be needed to adequately restore functional capability [9–11]. Unlike hearing or vision, proprioceptive afferent pathways originate not from a single organ but from diverse families of mechanoreceptors within muscles, tendons, joints, and even the skin . Proprioceptive information ascends within the dorsal column pathway through the dorsal root ganglia, the dorsal column nuclei, and thalamus before arriving in the primary somatosensory cortex ( S1 ). Crucially, neurons are somatotopically organised throughout this pathway, meaning that neighbouring neurons encode stimuli from closely related parts of the body. This gives rise to the sensory homunculus, which results from the ordered mapping of tactile representations of the body’s surface across the cortical surface .

[ABSTRACT] Ethylene is a plant hormone involved in many aspects of plant growth and development as well as responses to stress. The role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions has been explored from the perspective of plants. However, only a small number of studies have examined the role of ethylene in microbes. We demonstrated that Azospirillum brasilense contains a functional ethylene receptor that we call Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 ( AzoEtr1 ) after the nomenclature used in plants. AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces. Additionally, RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics showed that ethylene causes wide-spread metabolic changes that affect carbon and nitrogen metabolism. One result is the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate. Our results show a model in which ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasilense and re-wires its metabolism, suggesting that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing ethylene. These data provide potential new targets to regulate beneficial plant-microbe interactions. Food security is an increasing concern due to climate change and an increasing human population. Future food security will require sustainable agricultural practices that ensure elevated crop productivity while reducing inputs from chemical fertilizers, particularly, nitrogen, which can have adverse environmental effects. One of several strategies to decrease the use of chemical fertilizers is to inoculate crops with beneficial microorganisms. The establishment of plant-microbe associations in the rhizosphere is receiving increasing attention because of its profound effect on plant growth and vigor. The so-called “rhizosphere effect”, which describes the enhanced activity and density of microbes around the roots compared to the surrounding soil, plays a critical role in shaping the microbial rhizosphere communities which directly impact plant health and stress tolerance [1–4]. Root exudates not only support the growth and activity of rhizosphere microbial communities by providing nutrients, they also select for the microbiome and mediate microbe-microbe and plant-microbe interactions [1, 4–6]. The relationship between the microbiome and root exudates is bidirectional, as plant immune responses and phytohormone signaling can alter root exudate profiles [7–11]. Manipulating ethylene signaling or synthesis in plants or the application of ethylene can affect plant health as well as the population of microbes associated with the plant [12–18]. Ethylene was first discovered to be a phytohormone over 100 years ago and was the first identified gaseous, biological signaling molecule . In plants, it controls and modulates many developmental and physiological processes and responses to various environmental cues and stressors . It is naturally found in soil and depending on conditions, such as compaction and water saturation, can reach concentrations above 10 ppm, which is well above the levels needed to elicit responses in plants [20–23]. There are multiple sources of ethylene in the soil, including biotic biosynthesis by plants, bacteria, and fungi, as well as abiotic sources such as photochemical production triggered when sunlight is absorbed by dissolved organics .

[ABSTRACT] The INO80 protein is the main catalytic subunit of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex, which is critical for DNA repair and transcription regulation in murine spermatocytes. In this study, we explored the role of INO80 in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. INO80 immunolocalization at the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes suggested a role for INO80 in the meiotic sex body. Subsequent deletion of Ino80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes. Furthermore, the active form of RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes of Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes. A reduction in the recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition ( MSCI ) argues for INO80-helped recruitment of DNA repair factors required for silencing sex-linked genes. This role of INO80 is independent of a common INO80 target, H2A. Z. Instead, in the absence of INO80, a reduction in chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites occurs on the sex chromosomes. These data suggest a role for INO80 in DNA repair factor localization, thereby facilitating the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachynema. Mammalian gametogenesis involves the meiotic division of diploid germ cells that undergo homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination to generate haploid gametes. Extended prophase I during meiosis ensures the faithful execution of recombination to shuffle genetic material between homologous chromosomes by controlled introduction of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSB ) at the DSB hotspots by SPO11 followed by their repair . Synapsis between homologous autosomes occurs during the zygotene stage of meiotic prophase I. In contrast, non-homologous regions of the X and Y sex chromosomes in male germ cells do not synapse with each other . During pachynema, DNA double-strand break repair ( DSBR ) factors no longer localize to autosomes, indicating the completion of DSBR. For the sex chromosomes, the DSBR factors sequester at unpaired regions, forming a unique chromatin domain called the sex body . The sex chromosomes in spermatocytes undergo modifications by several DNA damage repair ( DDR ) factors such as BRCA1, ATR, and its activator TOPBP1 at the unpaired ( asynapsed ) chromosome axes . The sex chromosomes also undergo chromatin remodeling to induce epigenetic silencing of sex-linked genes. This process is known as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation ( MSCI ) . Incomplete MSCI leads to germ cell death during pachynema, causing male infertility . MSCI is initiated by DNA double-strand breaks ( DSB ) at the asynapsed axes and the incorporation of DSBR proteins at these DSB sites . ATR localizes to the DSBs along the chromosome axes . Serine-139 phosphorylation of H2A. X ( γH2A. X ) at the DSBs by ATR leads to the recruitment of another DSB factor, MDC1 [6, 10–12]. MDC1 localization amplifies γH2A. X in the protruding chromatin loops along the axes, establishing the characteristic sex-body and MSCI . Chromatin remodelers regulate chromatin accessibility. They play roles in several cellular processes, including DNA repair and transcription regulation.

[ABSTRACT] The pathway for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans is activated by SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family. SVH-1 is a dual-function factor that acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a protease to regulate early development. It is important to understand how SVH-1 is converted from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration. In this study, we demonstrate that cytidine deaminase ( CDD ) SVH-17/CDD-2 plays a role in the functional conversion of SVH-1. We find that the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the cdd-2 defect in axon regeneration. Furthermore, the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1. These results suggest that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor through modification of svh-1 mRNA. The ability of neurons to regenerate after injury is determined by a complex interplay between their intrinsic growth program and external cues . Injured neurons need to receive accurate and timely information about the extent of axonal damage to successfully increase their intrinsic growth capacity and regenerate. One process that contributes to this process is the activation of receptors by growth factors that promote the growth capacity of neurons . In neurons, intrinsic mechanisms that mediate regeneration are conserved across species. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful experimental model for elucidating axon regeneration mechanisms . Genetic screens have identified several signaling molecules required for axon regeneration [4–7]. Recent studies have identified the JNK MAP kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway as a key intrinsic regulator of regeneration initiation in C. elegans . The pathway is activated by a signaling cascade involving the mammalian HGF-like growth factor, SVH-1, and its receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ), SVH-2 . Thus, SVH-1–SVH-2 signaling is essential for neuronal regeneration but not for neuronal development. SVH-1 contains a Kringle domain, an N-terminal domain related to a plasminogen activation peptide, and a serine protease domain . These protein domains are also present in mammalian HGF and plasminogen, suggesting that SVH-1 is a member of the HGF/plasminogen family. SVH-2 is homologous to c-Met, a mammalian HGF RTK . The sequence homology of SVH-1 to HGF and SVH-2 to c-Met suggests that SVH-1–SVH-2 functions as a ligand–receptor pair in axon regeneration ( Fig 1A ). In mammals, HGF acts as a growth factor for c-Met and induces the activation of complex intracellular signaling pathways . However, unlike plasminogen, HGF lacks the Asp–His–Ser triad, which is essential for catalytic activity and cannot function as a protease ( Fig 1A; ). In contrast, plasminogen possesses an intact catalytic triad and functions as a protease. Protease activity is essential for plasminogen to remodel components of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( Fig 1A; ).

[ABSTRACT] Zebrafish collective behaviour is widely used to assess their physical and mental state, serving as a valuable tool to assess the impact of ageing, disease genetics, and the effect of drugs. The essence of these macroscopic phenomena can be represented by active matter models, where the individuals are abstracted as interactive self-propelling agents. The behaviour of these agents depends on a set of parameters in a manner reminiscent of those between the constituents of physical systems. In a few cases, the system may be controlled at the level of the individual constituents such as the interactions between colloidal particles, or the enzymatic behaviour of de novo proteins. Usually, however, while the collective behaviour may be influenced by environmental factors, it typically cannot be changed at will. Here, we challenge this scenario in a biological context by genetically modifying zebrafish. We thus demonstrate the potential of genetic modification in the context of controlling the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems at the level of the constituents, rather than externally. In particular, we probe the effect of the lack of col11a2 gene in zebrafish, which causes the early onset of osteoarthritis. The resulting col11a2 -/- zebrafish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties, bent their body less while swimming, and took longer to change their orientations. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype. We show that the collective behaviour of wildtype and col11a2 -/- zebrafish are captured with a simple active matter model, in which the mutant fish are modelled by self–propelling agents with a higher orientational noise on average. In this way, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning a biological system, changing the state space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active matter model. Animal groups exhibit a rich variety of collective behaviour, exhibiting complex patterns across different length scales, from a swarm of insects ( centimeters ) to large fish shoals ( kilometers ) [1–6]. Such collective motion may be interpreted as an emergent phenomena originating from interactions between individuals [7–9], which can be beneficial for the entire group [10–14]. Therefore, a reductionist way to approach such collective behavior is to treat the individuals as interacting self-propelling agents . In this sense, the animal group can be described as an active matter system [17–19]. Particular examples include flocking and schooling behavior of biological systems which can be reproduced in computer simulations [20–22], experiments with active colloids , as well as robotic swarms . Within the framework of a system comprised of many agents, or particles in the case of physical systems, the macroscopic behavior of the system can be controlled externally. In physical systems, state variables such as temperature drive phase transitions, or noise in agent trajectories leads to a dynamical ordering transition in active systems . In biological systems collective behavior in schools of fish, for example, can be strongly influenced by predation and swarms of midges may be controlled ambient lighting .

[ABSTRACT] Capillary plexus cultivation is crucial in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Theoretical simulations have been conducted to supplement the expensive experimental works. However, the mechanisms connecting mechanical and chemical stimuli remained undefined, and the functions of the different VEGF forms in the culture environment were still unclear. In this paper, we developed a hybrid model for simulating short-term in vitro capillary incubations. We used the Cellular Potts model to predict individual cell migration, morphology change, and continuum mechanics to quantify biogel deformation and VEGF transport dynamics. By bridging the mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation in the model, the results showed good agreement between the predicted network topology and experiments, in which elongated cells connected, forming the network cords and round cells gathered, creating cobblestone-like aggregates. The results revealed that the capillary-like networks could develop in high integrity only when the mechanical and chemical couplings worked adequately, with the cell morphology and haptotaxis driven by the soluble and bound forms of VEGF, respectively, functioning simultaneously. Capillary development, such as in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, plays a crucial role in embryonic development and wound healing, as well as the realization of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Cultivating blood capillaries is vital for the circulation connection and waste removal between artificial tissue and the living body [1–3]. Capillary cultivation in vitro can be classified into two categories depending on the experimental settings and lasting times . The short-term cultivations typically last from a few hours to days. The necessary chemicals during the capillary developing process are offered well before the trial startup. Such tests usually aim to research the endothelial cell migration behavior or the interactions between the cells and their environments [5–7]. The long-term incubations, on the other hand, are generally over weeks or months to allow for the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) or the functional proteins secreted from cells, mimicking the realistic environments for capillary growth and showing potential for applications such as wound healing and transplanting [8–10]. Since the 1980s, researchers have tried various substrates in in vitro capillary incubating experiments. They studied the relationships between endothelial cell behaviors and the mechanical properties of biogel materials. These studies revealed biogel remodeling, in which the cells exert traction forces on the substrates and disturb the material density during cell migration . For different purposes, researchers have designed various biogels composed of specific components, such as the mixing of collagen and gelatin to simulate the environments where proteins are denatured in burns and scalds or the coated fibronectin on scaffolds to study the fibronectin structures and functions for cell attachment promotion . Fibronectin is a biomaterial widely studied in recent years for its integrin-binding sub-domains, which can bind the integrin on the cellular membrane to stabilize the cell attachment. Moreover, together with its growth factor-binding sub-domains corresponding to various growth factors, fibronectin regulates growth factor sources in both in vitro and in vivo experiments [15–18].

[ABSTRACT] The Transforming Growth Factor beta ( TGF-β ) family consists of numerous secreted peptide growth factors that play significant roles in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. Typically studied as homodimers, these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that may enhance, repress, or generate new functions. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are only five TGF-β ligands, providing an opportunity to dissect ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates. As in vertebrates, these ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) and TGF-β/Activin subfamilies that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways. The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans. Here we show that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogens. We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs act nonredundantly as part of this response. We show that the two BMP-like ligands–DBL-1 and TIG-2–function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-β/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function together. Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers. Additionally, we identify TIG-2 and TIG-3 as members of a rare subset of TGF-β ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers. Finally, we show that canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway do not play a major role in survival. These results demonstrate a new potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and may provide a process for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens. TGF-β signaling is a highly conserved process that plays significant roles in development in organisms ranging from invertebrates to humans [1–4]. This signaling family also plays an important role in the post-developmental adult in maintaining homeostasis and repair [3, 5–7], as well as serving as one of the highly conserved signaling mechanisms involved in the immune response [8–14]. The canonical TGF-β family signaling cascade is initiated by binding of a dimerized ligand to a heterotetrametric receptor complex and mediated through activation of the Smad proteins to regulate transcription . The human genome contains 33 TGF-β ligands, seven type I receptors, and five type II receptors [3, 16–18]. Currently, active research is focused on the mechanisms that mediate specific or promiscuous interactions between ligands and receptors and the consequences for Smad signaling. These mechanisms have profound implications for normal development and disease [19–25]. The number of potential interactions, however, increases the difficulty of these analyses. The reduced repertoire of ligands and receptors in invertebrate organisms provides an opportunity to study ligand-receptor functional interactions more completely.

[ABSTRACT] The DNA damage response ( DDR ) constitutes a vital cellular process that safeguards genome integrity. This biological process involves substantial alterations in chromatin structure, commonly orchestrated by epigenetic enzymes. Here, we show that the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 ( Nat4 ), known to acetylate the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2A, is implicated in the response to DNA damage in S. cerevisiae. Initially, we demonstrate that yeast cells lacking Nat4 have an increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells. Accordingly, upon DNA damage, NAT4 gene expression is elevated, and the enzyme is specifically recruited at double-strand breaks. Delving deeper into its effects on the DNA damage signaling cascade, nat4-deleted cells exhibit lower levels of the damage-induced modification H2AS129ph ( γH2A ), accompanied by diminished binding of the checkpoint control protein Rad9 surrounding the double-strand break. Consistently, Mec1 kinase recruitment at double-strand breaks, critical for H2AS129ph deposition and Rad9 retention, is significantly impaired in nat4Δ cells. Consequently, Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effector kinase Rad53, indicative of DNA damage checkpoint activation, is reduced. Importantly, we found that the effects of Nat4 in regulating the checkpoint signaling cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4. Overall, this study points towards a new functional link between histone N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and the DDR, associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity. Yeast N-alpha terminal acetyltransferase 4 ( Nat4 ), also designated as NAA40, NatD and Patt1 in mammals, is classified among the family of N-terminal acetyltransferases ( NATs ), which is comprised of nine members in eukaryotes . NATs have a distinct function from lysine acetyltransferases, since they catalyze the covalent addition of an acetyl moiety to the alpha-amino group at the N-terminal end of proteins [2–4]. Nat4 was originally discovered in S. cerevisiae and it has a conserved human ortholog hNAA40 . Unlike almost all other identified NATs that target a wide variety of substrates , both yeast Nat4 and hNAA40 function as a monomer and selectively N-terminally acetylate serine 1 ( S1 ) on histones H4 ( Nt-AcH4 ) and H2A ( Nt-AcH2A ) . Importantly, it has been demonstrated that Nat4-associated N-terminal acetylation ( Nt-Ac ) affects critical cellular processes including chromatin function and regulation of gene expression, which in turn influences biological phenotypes like cellular aging, metabolic rewiring, and cancer progression [10–14]. Additionally, nat4Δ has been reported to increase the sensitivity of yeast cells to different cytotoxic agents, including 3-aminotriazole, benomyl, dinitrobenzene and thiabendazole . Nonetheless, Nat4 has not been previously linked to DNA damage response. In eukaryotic cells, the chromatin environment is fundamental in regulating how cells combat DNA damage, since the generation of a DNA double-strand break ( DSB ) occurs in the chromatin context. Therefore, alterations in chromatin structure mediated by chromatin remodelers are instrumental for the prompt response to DNA damage .

[ABSTRACT] Phylogenies depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer, i. e., cancer phylogenies, offer valuable insights about cancer development and guide treatment strategies. Many methods exist that reconstruct cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing. However, these methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations, or, in some cases, fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Here, we introduce Orchard, a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate using up to 1000 mutations. Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, a new result derived in this paper. Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations. Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALLs ). Remarkably, Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies using up to 1, 000 mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations. Cancerous cells contain somatic mutations that override normal cellular controls . Evolution progresses as cancer cells acquire additional mutations that provide selection advantages , leading to genetically distinct cancerous cell subpopulations ( i. e., subclones ) characterized by sets of shared mutations . Phylogenies describing the ancestral relationships of subclones in an individual cancer can reveal important evolutionary events, help to characterize the cancer’s heterogeneity and progression , support the discovery of new driver mutations , and provide clinical insight for treatment regimens . Many cancer evolution studies use bulk DNA from multiple cancer samples to reconstruct phylogenies depicting the evolution of subclones in an individual cancer [10–16]. These phylogenies are also prerequisites for inferring migration histories of metastases . A mutation tree is an arborescence that can represent portions of a cancer phylogeny that satisfy the infinite sites assumption ( ISA ). The ISA posits that each mutation is acquired only once and is never reverted. A phylogeny that adheres to the ISA is a perfect phylogeny; cancer phylogenies are often perfect because of low mutation rates ( ∼1–10 mutations / megabase ) . By definition, a mutation tree is a perfect phylogeny, and each non-root node in a mutation tree represents a somatic mutation present in one or more cancerous cell subpopulations. Bulk DNA data obtained by sequencing multiple tissue samples from the same cancer can be used to reconstruct a mutation tree by solving the mixed sample perfect phylogeny ( MSPP ) problem. In the MSPP problem, each cancer sample is an unknown mixture of clonal genotypes, i. e, clones, that are related to one another via a perfect phylogeny.

[ABSTRACT] Neoantigen immunogenicity prediction is a highly challenging problem in the development of personalised medicines. Low reactivity rates in called neoantigens result in a difficult prediction scenario with limited training datasets. Here we describe ImmugenX, a modular protein language modelling approach to immunogenicity prediction for CD8+ reactive epitopes. ImmugenX comprises of a pMHC encoding module trained on three pMHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR encoding module and a set of context specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. Compared with state-of-the-art models for each task, ImmugenX’s encoding module performs comparably or better on pMHC binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction and stability tasks. ImmugenX outperforms all compared models on pMHC immunogenicity prediction ( Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0. 619, average precision: 0. 514 ), with a 7% increase in average precision compared to the next best model. ImmugenX shows further improved performance on immunogenicity prediction with the integration of TCR context information. ImmugenX performance is further analysed for interpretability, which locates areas of weakness found across existing immunogenicity models and highlight possible biases in public datasets. High-quality in silico prediction of antigen immunogenicity could be a key factor in the development of effective personalised therapies for cancer. Therapies based on tumour derived neoantigens, often specific to that patient, have gained traction in recent years. Correctly selecting target antigens is a critical step in treatment development, since the mutations in a patient’s tumour can greatly exceed treatment payloads. Rates of reactivity in peptides can be as low as 2–6% of called mutations for a given patient’s tumour when tested. In high mutation settings, this makes the ranking of candidate mutations key to designing an effective therapy. ImmugenX and the models benchmarked in this work focus on HLA class I presented epitopes, recognised by CD8+ T-cells, as the definition of immunogenicity; however, a similar architecture and training approach could in future be applied to class II and CD4+ reactivities. There are many models focused on predicting prerequisite steps to T-cell recognition. Binding affinity ( BA ) models such as netMHCpan ( 3. 0 and earlier ) and MHCFlurry are trained on quantitative affinity measurements of peptide-MHC ( pMHC ) complexes. Newer versions of netMHCpan, MHCFlurry and comparable models such as MixMHCpred are trained to predict whether peptides are naturally eluted ligands ( EL ) as measured by mass spectrometry. Several more recent methods have been developed using more complex neural network architectures such as RNNs and transformers to solve these tasks. Efforts have also been made to automatically benchmark existing models as new data becomes available , with current findings showing strong agreement between several models with overall high performance. A smaller number of models have been reported that predict other pMHC formation-related metrics such as pMHC stability , as measured by dissociation assays, and TAP transport efficiency . Predictions based on these pMHC tasks are all known to correlate with T-cell immunogenicity.

[ABSTRACT] The quality of meat is important to the consumer. Color is a primary indicator of meat quality and is characterized mainly into lightness, redness, and yellowness. Here, we used the genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and gene-based association analysis with whole-genome resequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to map genes related to meat lightness and redness to a 6. 24 kb QTL region . This analysis revealed that only the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma ( PPP1CC ) was associated with meat color ( P = 8. 65E-08 ). The causal relationships between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness/redness were further validated through Mendelian randomization analyses ( P < 2. 9E-12 ). Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout ( PPP1CC-SSKO ) mice were generated and these mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in the limb muscles. In addition, the predominant myofiber shifted from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Through transcriptome and targeted metabolome evidence, we found that inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of typical slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes and enhanced the glycolysis pathway. Functional validation through a plasmid reporter assay revealed that a SNP located in the intron of PPP1CC could regulate the gene transcription activity. The differences in meat color phenotypes, myoglobin content, frequency of rs315520807 variant, expression of PPP1CC and fast-twitch fiber marker genes were detected between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens. In this study, PPP1CC was identified as the causative gene for meat color, and the new target gene and variant that can aid in the innovation of meat improvement technology were detected. Meat is one of the most important sources of high-quality proteins for humans. Meat quality is important to the consumer and represents a critical issue for the livestock production industry [1–4]. Meat quality traits are complex and are usually determined by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors . Meat color is the first sensory information available to consumers and is determined by the dimensions of lightness, redness, and yellowness. Redness and yellowness are chromatically determined by pigment content, and lightness is chromatically determined by microstructure Meat color not only influences appearance but is also correlated with pH, muscle fiber characteristics and lipid deposition. Severe myopathy related to meat color, including pale, soft, exudative ( PSE ) meat, results in consumer rejection and severe economic losses in the industry. Understanding the genetic basis of meat color is important for the innovation of modern meat improvement technology. Some causative or related genes for meat color have been identified in chickens and domestic pigs. Strong relationships between beta-carotene oxygenase 1 ( BCO1 ) and chicken yellowness and between myosin heavy chain 3 ( MYH3 ) and redness/intramuscular fat in pig skeletal muscle have been reported. Changes in meat lightness might be related to changes in muscle glycolytic potential . The Rendement Napole gene ( RN ) and phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit gamma 1 ( PHKG1 ) were found to be involved in glycolytic potential.

[ABSTRACT] Spatially nonlinear stimulus integration by retinal ganglion cells lies at the heart of various computations performed by the retina. It arises from the nonlinear transmission of signals that ganglion cells receive from bipolar cells, which thereby constitute functional subunits within a ganglion cell’s receptive field. Inferring these subunits from recorded ganglion cell activity promises a new avenue for studying the functional architecture of the retina. This calls for efficient methods, which leave sufficient experimental time to leverage the acquired knowledge for further investigating identified subunits. Here, we combine concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography and introduce super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ) as a technique to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits. Simulations demonstrate that this approach can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations, and application in recordings of primate parasol ganglion cells validates the experimental feasibility. STR can potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within only a few tens of minutes of recording time, making it ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings. Retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, are classically modelled with a linear-nonlinear ( LN ) model . This can take the center-surround structure of their receptive fields into account, but indiscriminately considers luminance signals inside the receptive field to be integrated linearly and passed through a nonlinearity only afterwards, at the model’s output stage. While the LN model is still popular due to its simplicity, it has long been known that many ganglion cells respond strongly to spatially structured stimuli, even when there is no net-change in the average illumination of the receptive field [2–6]–a characteristic the LN model cannot replicate. This spatial nonlinearity is mediated via functional subunits in the receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells. These enable various specific computations that would be impossible without them, from sensitivity to fine spatial structures to various types of motion and pattern sensitivity [7–13]. Moreover, nonlinear spatial integration also plays a major role in shaping ganglion cell responses to natural stimuli [14–16]. The biological correlate of receptive field subunits are the retina’s bipolar cells, which have been found to rectify their excitatory inputs to ganglion cells . Given the importance of spatially nonlinear processing in the retina, understanding the underlying circuits is highly desirable. For retinal ganglion cells, extracellular recordings with multielectrode arrays allow large-scale functional characterizations that can capture the diversity of cell types [20–23]. For bipolar cells, progress has been made on large-scale recordings using glutamate imaging , but it is difficult to combine these techniques to obtain information about the connectivity between large populations of bipolar and ganglion cells. As an alternative, several approaches have been developed to infer subunits and thus connected bipolar cells from ganglion cell recordings alone [26–31]. However, these approaches are often based on ganglion cell responses to fine spatiotemporal white noise stimuli, which generally evoke comparatively weak responses, making long recordings necessary.

[ABSTRACT] An important application of CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) technology is for identifying chemical-genetic interactions ( CGIs ). Discovery of genes that interact with exposure to antibiotics can yield insights to drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance. The objective is to identify CRISPRi mutants whose relative abundance is suppressed ( or enriched ) in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted, reflecting synergistic behavior. Different sgRNAs for a given target can induce a wide range of protein depletion and differential effects on growth rate. The effect of sgRNA strength can be partially predicted based on sequence features. However, the actual growth phenotype depends on the sensitivity of cells to depletion of the target protein. For essential genes, sgRNA efficiency can be empirically measured by quantifying effects on growth rate. We observe that the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs. sgRNA efficiency interacts in a non-linear way with drug sensitivity, producing an effect where the concentration-dependence is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength ( and less so for sgRNAs that induce too much or too little target depletion ). To capture this interaction, we propose a new statistical method called CRISPRi-DR ( for Dose-Response model ) that incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation. We use CRISPRi-DR to re-analyze data from a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify genes that interact with antibiotics. This approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets, which we show via an CRISPRi dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources. The performance is competitive with the best of several related analytical methods. However, for noisier datasets, some of these methods generate far more significant interactions, likely including many false positives, whereas CRISPRi-DR maintains higher precision, which we observed in both empirical and simulated data. CRISPR technology is becoming an increasingly important tool for genome-wide identification of gene functions in various environmental conditions [1–3]. For example, several different approaches have been devised to exploit CRISPR to induce depletion of target proteins. In the earlier CRISPRko approaches, a nuclease-active form of CAS9 was used to deactivate target genes by cutting the DNA at a target locus and induce DNA repair, which could introduce indels causing frameshifts or inserting new elements, abrogating their function completely [1–3]. Another approach, CRISPRa, utilizes dCAS9 fusions with effectors that actively enhance or suppress transcription through direct interaction with the RNA polymerase ( such as transcription factors that can activate transcription ) . In CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ), a catalytically-dead CAS9 protein ( dCAS9 ) is recruited to a chromosomal locus by a single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) with a short ( ~20 bp ) complimentary sequence and physically blocks transcription . dCAS9 nucleases from several different organisms are available for CRISPRi ( e. g. S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, ) and different promoters and chemicals have been used for dCAS9 induction.

[ABSTRACT] Finding communities in gene co-expression networks is a common first step toward extracting biological insight from these complex datasets. Most community detection algorithms expect genes to be organized into assortative modules, that is, groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. While it is reasonable to expect that these modules exist, using methods that assume they exist a priori is risky, as it guarantees that alternative organizations of gene interactions will be ignored. Here, we ask: can we find meaningful communities without imposing a modular organization on gene co-expression networks, and how modular are these communities ? For this, we use a recently developed community detection method, the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model ( SBM ), that does not assume that assortative modules exist. Instead, the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes. Using RNAseq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster, we show that ( a ) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods, that ( b ) several of those gene groups are not modular, and that ( c ) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities. These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks. Gene co-expression networks inform our understanding of cell and organismal function by encoding associations between genes. Associations between expression levels can indicate common function, and the number of connections can point to central or regulatory genes . Due to the large dimensionality of gene expression data, often composed of several thousands of gene expression measures, a major tool in the analysis of co-expression is gene clustering: separating the genes into related groups, which can then be explored separately . This drastically reduces the number of genes we need to consider at the same time and allows for the identification of hubs or centrally connected genes that can be used to inform further experimental validation . The question is, given a co-expression network, how should we cluster the genes ? The general idea behind several methods is to look for similar genes, as these are expected to be involved in related biological functions. However, several definitions of similarity have been used. The most basic measure of similarity borrows from classical morphological integration theory and attempts to find gene modules based on their correlations. In this context, genes in the same module are expected to be highly correlated and perform similar functions, while genes in different modules are expected to have low correlations [5–7].

[ABSTRACT] Cytoplasmic poly ( A ) -binding protein ( PABPC; Pab1 in yeast ) is thought to be involved in multiple steps of post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, translation termination, and mRNA decay. To understand both the direct and indirect roles of PABPC in more detail, we have employed mass spectrometry to assess the abundance of the components of the yeast proteome, as well as RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq to analyze changes in the abundance and translation of the yeast transcriptome, in cells lacking the PAB1 gene. We find that pab1Δ cells manifest drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. Defects in translation initiation and the stabilization of specific classes of mRNAs in pab1Δ cells appear to be partly indirect consequences of reduced levels of specific initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of the deadenylation complex in addition to the general loss of Pab1’s direct role in these processes. Cells devoid of Pab1 also manifested a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination. Collectively, our results indicate that, unlike the loss of simpler regulatory proteins, elimination of cellular Pab1 is profoundly pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcriptional regulation. Eukaryotic mRNAs are subject to complex post-transcriptional regulation by RNA binding proteins ( RBPs ) that control protein output. Cytoplasmic poly ( A ) -binding proteins ( PABPCs ) are RBPs that bind polyadenylated tails at mRNA 3’-ends and then play roles in multiple stages of cytoplasmic mRNA regulation, from translation initiation to termination and mRNA decay [1–3]. The numerous functions of PABPC are attributed to its ability to interact with not only mRNAs but also various other proteins to form messenger ribonucleoprotein ( mRNP ) complexes . PABPC’s conserved structure consists of three regions: i ) four RNA recognition motif ( RRM ) domains, two of which ( RRM1 and RRM2 ) bind 12 adenosines with high affinity , while the protein overall covers 27 adenosines , ii ) a proline-rich ( P ) linker domain, and iii ) a C-terminal mademoiselle ( MLLE ) domain that interacts with other proteins via their PABP-interacting motif 2 ( PAM2 ) . Mammals have multiple isoforms of PABPCs, of which the most ubiquitous isoform as well as the most studied is PABPC1, whereas the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only one PABPC, Pab1 . The current model for general mRNA decay in yeast involves biphasic poly ( A ) tail shortening by Pan2-Pan3 and Ccr4-Not deadenylase complexes, decapping by the Dcp1/Dcp2 holoenzyme, and exonucleolytic Xrn1-mediated 5’-3’ degradation or exosome-mediated 3’-5’ degradation . PABPC appears to have a paradoxical role in these processes. On the one hand, PABPC1/Pab1 stimulates deadenylation by recruiting Pan2-Pan3 to the poly ( A ) tail through its interaction with the PAM2 motif on Pan3 .

[ABSTRACT] Slow brain rhythms, for example during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization, can be accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. Such slow brain rhythms typically have a lower frequency than tonic action-potential firing. They are assumed to arise from network-level mechanisms, involving synaptic interactions and delays, or from intrinsically bursting neurons. Neuronal burst generation is commonly attributed to ion channels with slow kinetics. Here, we explore an alternative process generically available to all neurons with class I excitability. It is based on the interplay of fast-spiking voltage dynamics with a one-dimensional slow dynamics of the extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. We use bifurcation analysis of the complete system as well as the slow-fast method to reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation–a common feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase, bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing the bifurcation structure, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization block. We suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The identified minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump’s generic contribution to burst dynamics can, therefore, contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and, potentially, inform therapeutic strategies. Rhythms on diverse timescales are a hallmark of our brain’s activity. Such oscillatory activity is associated with physiological states, ranging from normal breathing to the consolidation of memories, or pathological situations such as epileptic seizures and spreading depolarization ( SD ) [1–5]. Some rhythms are orders of magnitude slower than single-neuron spiking. For these, different mechanistic origins of their slow dynamics have been proposed. First, a neuron’s embedding in the network can produce bursts via reverberating activity, with synaptic delays serving as an important parameter that determines the period of the resulting oscillations . Second, one or more cells with intrinsically bursting dynamics can act as pacemakers and entrain larger networks. Combinations of both of the above mechanisms, network effects and intrinsic bursting, have also been reported . Along these lines, brain regions that exhibit large-scale oscillatory behaviour often contain significant numbers of single-neuron bursters [9–11], fostering network entrainment via pacemaker neurons . Theoretical and experimental research suggests that the neuron’s ability to generate bursts of activity intrinsically arises from the expression of specific ion channels, such as hyperpolarization-activated inward transient potassium channels or calcium-dependent channels [2, 12–14]. The kinetics of these channels form the basis of the slow dynamics. Ion channels with dedicated slow kinetics, however, are not the only single-cell process that can generate rhythms on long timescales. Specifically, an interplay between concentration dynamics and membrane dynamics has been shown to give rise to slow oscillations [15–17].

[ABSTRACT] Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like clustering stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance. Furthermore, current frameworks do not allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering, highlighting a significant gap in the methodology. We present the COPS R-package, tailored for strong evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. Some of these methods are not accessible through R, and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS. Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics, they vary considerably across methods and datasets. Therefore, it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance, and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in new datasets. Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study. Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies. Clustering algorithms are often used in omics studies to identify groups of patients sharing similar molecular patterns. The underlying assumption is that these patient subgroups may represent new disease subtypes with possibly different survival outcomes or differential response to various treatments . Advancements in high-throughput sequencing has enabled clustering analysis across multiple omics layers like gene-expression, DNA-methylation, and somatic mutations to define disease subtypes. However, the high dimensionality of omics data makes generating relevant patient groupings extremely challenging for heterogeneous diseases like cancer. Popular methods often adopt an entirely data-driven approach, which, while important, could be improved by incorporating pathway information, particularly in fields like cancer biology. This integration may result in more interpretable clustering outcomes with enhanced prognostic relevance. However, although many pathway-based multi-view clustering methods have emerged recently, they have yet to be systematically compared with their data-driven counterparts. Moreover, current benchmarking studies do not provide a computational platform for testing and comparing multi-view clustering methods on new datasets, allowing for the selection of the best clustering methods based on stability and other relevant metrics, nor do they permit access to both existing and new pathway-based methods, thereby highlighting a significant gap in the methodology. Furthermore, these studies lack a multi-objective approach that could effectively evaluate which methods offer the best trade-off between clustering metrics.

[ABSTRACT] Development of multicellular organisms requires well-orchestrated interplay between cell-intrinsic transcription factors and cell-cell signaling. One set of highly conserved transcription factors that plays diverse roles in development is the SoxC group. C. elegans contains a sole SoxC protein, SEM-2. SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development, and for specifying the sex myoblast ( SM ) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage. We have identified a new partial loss-of-function sem-2 allele that has a proline to serine change in the C-terminal tail of the highly conserved DNA-binding domain. Detailed analyses of mutant animals harboring this point mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage. First, SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381, the sole C. elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage. Second, in addition to specifying the SM fate, SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage. Finally, SEM-2 appears to directly regulate the expression of hlh-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor and plays critical roles in proper patterning of the M lineage. Our data, along with previous studies, suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. Furthermore, our work identified new interactions in the gene regulatory network ( GRN ) underlying C. elegans postembryonic development and adds to the general understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins. Metazoan development is characterized by the specification and diversification of multipotent cells, as well as the proper organization of their differentiated descendants. These processes require well-orchestrated interplay between cell-intrinsic transcription factors and cell-cell signaling. The C. elegans postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage, offers a unique model system to dissect the underlying regulatory logic of cell fate specification and diversification. The M lineage is derived from a single multipotent precursor cell, the M mesoblast . During hermaphrodite postembryonic development, the M mesoblast cell undergoes stereotypical divisions to produce fourteen striated body wall muscles ( BWMs ), two non-muscle coelomocytes ( CCs ), and two multipotent sex myoblasts ( SMs ) that then proliferate to produce sixteen sex muscles—four type I and four type II vulval muscles ( vm1s and vm2s ), as well as four type I and four type II uterine muscles ( um1s and um2s ) —that are required for egg laying ( Fig 1A–1B ). Previous studies have identified multiple transcription factors and signaling components essential for the proper development of the M lineage . In particular, LIN-12/Notch signaling is known to function upstream of the single C. elegans SoxC protein, SEM-2, to specify the SM fate in the ventral M lineage, while the zinc finger transcription factor SMA-9 antagonizes BMP signaling to specify the M lineage-derived CC ( M-CC for short ) fate in the dorsal side [3–6]. SMA-9 functions by activating the expression of the sole FoxF/C transcription factor in C. elegans, LET-381, in the M-CC mother cells.
